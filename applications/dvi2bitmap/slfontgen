# Script with the same interface as MakeTeXPK, which does nothing
# other than find the first occurrence of either mktexpk or MakeTeXPK
# in the path, and calls it.
#
# This is a semi-hack to facilitate export_run targets in the
# Starlink version of the distribution.  The script is of neither
# interest nor utility otherwise, and it's not included in the
# non-Starlink distribution.
#
#
#
# MakeTeXPK docs:
#
## This script must echo the name of the generated PK file (and nothing
## else) to standard output or to the designated file descriptor.
## Yes, this is different from the original dvips.
## 
## Parameters:
##   name dpi bdpi magnification [mode [destdir [redirect]]]
##
##   `name' is the base name of the font, such as `cmr10'.
##   `dpi' is the resolution the font is needed at.
##   `bdpi' is the base resolution, used to intuit the mode to use.
##   `magnification' is a string to pass to MF as the value of `mag'.
##   `mode', if supplied, is the mode to use. Unless it's `default', in
##     which case we guess. (This is so people can specify a destdir
##     without a mode.)
##   `destdir', if supplied, is either the absolute directory name to use
##     (if it starts with a /) or relative to the default DESTDIR (if not).
##   `redirect', if supplied, is a string of the form '>&n', where n is the
##     number of the file descriptor which is to receive, instead of stdout,
##     the name of the newly created pk file.
#
# We don't use the redirect argument.
