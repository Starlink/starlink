2004-11-04  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* all: Merged changes from branch dvi2bitmap-0-12-patches,
	including various bugfixes.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: repository moved to
	cvs.starlink.ac.uk, and the configuration system heavily reworked
	to match that required for the other Starlink applications.

	* This will become 0.13.

2004-01-16  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* InputByteStream.cc (bindToFileDescriptor): add check that
	MAP_FAILED is defined and cope when it's not; this is required by
	POSIX, but apparently not always present even when sys/mman.h is
	there.  Released 0.12-1.

2003-12-21  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* all: released 0.12 -- no changes required from 0.12b2

2003-10-27  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* dvi2bitmap.cc (process_special): in `outputfile' special,
	support both %d and # as page-number indicators (significant
	rewriting of this branch)

2003-10-03  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* dvi2bitmap.cc (process_special): add `unit' special, and
	refactor the `strut' special.

	* Bitmap.cc (strut, rule, mark): modified logic to match rule()
	better, causing a few single-pixel changes; rule() logic
	clarified.  Support for `mark' now works.

	* DviFile.cc, DviFile.h (convertUnits): added functionality to
	convert to and from arbitrary unit combinations.

	* DviFile.cc, DviFile.h, PkFont.cc, PkFont.h: Rationalised the way
	that magnifications and unit conversions are done, to enable new
	functionality (converting between units more rationally).  This
	is tremendously error-prone, and difficult to write a regression
	test for, but it produces apparently correct results from
	test/magtest.tex.

	* all: released 0.12b2

2003-09-30  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* Bitmap.cc, Bitmap.h : Added support for marks in bitmaps,
	settable by Bitmap::mark() and retrievable by getMark().

	* dvi2bitmap.cc: add `mark' special, to use new functionality in
	Bitmap.cc.

	* DviFile.cc, DviFile.h, dvi2bitmap.cc, dvireport.cc: Added
	DviFileEvent::release method to release events, instead of using
	`delete'.  Documented that this is correct practice.

	* DviFile.cc: initialised resolution_ in constructor (how did I
	get away without this for so long?)

	* InputByteStream.cc (read_buf_): reread input when the read fails
	due to an interrupted system call.

	* all: released version 0.12b1

2003-09-07  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* DviFile.cc, DviFile.h: added DviUnits enum,
	convertFromScaledpoints function, and expanded documentation

	* dvireport.cc, dvireport.1: added dvireport program, using above
	functionality, and acting as a simple example of the use of the
	library (used it to debug slight positioning problems with the
	textpos LaTeX package, so it's handy, too).

2003-09-01  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* dvi2bitmap.cc, dvi2bitmap.1: modify --output so that it sets the
	name of the output file, rather than a pattern, if there's no % char.

2003-08-22  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* InputByteStream.cc, InputByteStream.h, FileByteStream.cc:
	input files are now mapped with mmap, if that's available, and if
	they're determined to be seekable (ie, regular files).

2003-08-21  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* Bitmap.cc: Corrected scaleDown method: was working only for
	bpp=1.  That meant that the scaling stopped working, and you got
	heavily pixellated characters for all bitmaps after the first.

	* configure.ac: reorder check for getopt and co. -- should be
	after other library checks

	* all: Version 0.11 released

2003-08-12  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* DviFile.cc: getEndOfPage corrected; would have failed
	(never-ending loop, I think) if called after the last page.  eof()
	also corrected, so that it now returns true if the scanning of the
	DVI file has reached the postamble
	
2003-08-11  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* PipeStream.cc: Finally (?) debugged.
	* all: Substantial additions to documentation.  Version 0.11b1
	released

2003-08-03  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* libdvi2bitmap Transformed into library.
	* all Reorganised using automake/autoconf/libtool.
