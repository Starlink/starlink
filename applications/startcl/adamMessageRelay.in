# This script acts as a "go-between" between a tk application and adam
# tasks. The tk application cannot communicate directly with an adam
# task because adam_receive blocks waiting for messages and so if it
# was called within the tk application, the user interface would "hang".
#
# The go-between waits for adam messages; if a message is received from
# the tk application, the message value is executed as a tcl command and
# the result sent to the tk application in an Adam inform message. If a
# message is received from an adam task its contents are written to
# standard output (for the tk application to read).

# Initialise the adam message system using comand line argument as our
# task name.
