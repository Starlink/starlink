      SUBROUTINE ASTSIMPLIFY( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ASTSIMPLIFY

*  Purpose:
*     Simplify a Mapping.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ASTSIMPLIFY( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application simplifies a Mapping (which may be a compound
*     Mapping such as a CmpMap) to eliminate redundant computational
*     steps, or to merge separate steps which can be performed more
*     efficiently in a single operation.

*  Usage:
*     astsimplify this result

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     FMT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The format in which to store output objects. For allowed values,
*        see the top level help for the ATOOLS package using command
*        'atlhelp'. Only used if the output object is written to a text
*        file. An error is reported if the output object cannot be written
*        using the requested format. ["AST"]
*     RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
*        An text file to receive the simplified Mapping.
*     THIS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An NDF or text file holding the Mapping. If an NDF is supplied,
*        the Mapping from the base Frame of the WCS FrameSet to the
*        current Frame will be used.
