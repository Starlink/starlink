1 ATOOLS

 Version 1.0 of ATOOLS is now available. It is fully documented in SUN/???.

 ATOOLS is a package of applications which manipulate descriptions
 of coordinate frames, mappings, etc, in the form of AST Objects (see
 SUN/210). Each application within the ATOOLS package corresponds closely
 to one of the functions within the AST library. ATOOLS thus provides a
 high-level interface to the AST library.
