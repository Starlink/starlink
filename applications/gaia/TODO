  GAIA TODO LIST
  ==============

  o CCD Mosaics

     - Display CCD Mosaics as a single exposure, partially done, 
       the blink compare toolbox will display side-by-side.

     - Display CCD Mosaics with correct orientations (using a tiling
       scheme of some kind), again partially done.

  o Add facilities to replace INSPECT

      - Histograms of regions

  o Lookup tables

      - Highlighting of specific ranges

      - LUT creation/manpulation

  o Astrometry solutions

      - Import columns by property not order (do not assume ID RA DEC...).

      - Grab other astrometry-type tables (incl positions).

      - Filter objects:
           - by maximum offset (arcsec)
           - by signal to noise determined by centroid (reject faints...)

  o ESP toolbox

      - Extend report of results and add results analysis
  
      - Display profiles of various kinds (done for counts and integrated counts)
       
      - GAUFIT analyses

  o Slices

      - Add ability to thicken slice (average over several pixels)

      - Record slices as text file (just NDF at present)

  o Printing

      - Create and display true-colour images (from several images in
        different filters)

  o Variants

      - Create production standalone version (includes parts of other
        packages as necessary).

      - Add native IRAF image display support (hard)

  o Configuration

      - Extend startup options configuration to other toolboxes

      - Add simple applications building facilities.

      - Add toolbar to control toolboxes or unify behaviour about
        withdrawal and related graphics etc (i.e. offer option to 
        keep contours visible when toolbox "closed").

  o Update to latest Skycat version (always)

      - Bias subtraction code

  o Catalogues

      - Release CDS interface

      - Increase search box maximum

      - Add Landolt catalogue

  o Regions
       
      - display a list of regions and allow table-based control

  o Contours

      - cheat offset correction for image WCS alignments (more
        convenient than toolbox shift).   

  o Image Analysis:
         
      - integrate GAUFIT 
      
      - add convolution toolbox (inc gaussians)

      - add image orientation/rescaling facilities (geometric
        resampling). 

  o Photom toolbox
     
      - add RA/Dec to the displayed coordinates.

  o Positions toolbox:
   
      - utilReUseWidget to keep configuration when fails

      - Save/push to proper catalogue

      - Generate IDs if none specified (and others are).

  o Graphics toolbox:

      - add facilities to draw figures and text from text files (easier
        than the save graphics facilities) and to work with RA/DEC 
        coordinates. Idea is to have proper diagramming facilities.

  o On-help line:
  
      - get external links following to work and then add some.

  o Command-line options.

      - make it possible to load more than one catalogue.
