       lmatch ?mode? list pattern

              Search  the  elements  of list, returning a list of
              all elements matching pattern.  If none  match,  an
              empty list is returned.

              The mode argument indicates how the elements of the
              list are to be matched against pattern and it  must
              have one of the following values:

              -exact The  list  element  must contain exactly the
                     same string as pattern.

              -glob  Pattern is a  glob-style  pattern  which  is
                     matched  against each list element using the
                     same rules as the string match command.

              -regexp
                     Pattern is treated as a  regular  expression
                     and  matched against each list element using
                     the same rules as the regexp command.

              If mode is omitted then it defaults to -glob.

              Only the -exact  comparison  will  work  on  binary
              data.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
