       lempty list
              Determine  if  the  specified  list  is  empty.  If
              empty, 1 is returned,  otherwise,  0  is  returned.
              This  command is an alternative to comparing a list
              to an empty string, however it checks for a  string
              of all whitespaces, which is an empty list.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
