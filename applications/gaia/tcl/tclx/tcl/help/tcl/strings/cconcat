       cconcat ?string1? ?string2? ?...?
              Concatenate  the arguments, returning the resulting
              string.  While  string  concatenation  is  normally
              performed  by the parser, it is occasionally useful
              to have a command that returns a  string.   The  is
              generally  useful  when  a  command  to evaluate is
              required.  No separators are inserted  between  the
              strings.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
