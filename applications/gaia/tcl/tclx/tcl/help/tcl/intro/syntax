NAME
       Tcl - Summary of Tcl language syntax.


DESCRIPTION
       The following rules define the syntax and semantics of the
       Tcl language:

       [1]    A Tcl script is a string  containing  one  or  more
              commands.   Semi-colons  and  newlines  are command
              separators unless quoted as described below.  Close
              brackets  are  command  terminators  during command
              substitution (see below) unless quoted.

       [2]    A command is evaluated in two  steps.   First,  the
              Tcl  interpreter  breaks the command into words and
              performs substitutions as described  below.   These
              substitutions are performed in the same way for all
              commands.  The first word is used to locate a  com-
              mand  procedure  to carry out the command, then all
              of the words of the command are passed to the  com-
              mand  procedure.   The command procedure is free to
              interpret each of its words in any  way  it  likes,
              such  as  an  integer,  variable name, list, or Tcl
              script.  Different commands interpret  their  words
              differently.

       [3]    Words  of  a  command  are separated by white space
              (except for newlines,  which  are  command  separa-
              tors).

       [4]    If  the  first  character of a word is double-quote
              (``"'') then the word is  terminated  by  the  next
              double-quote   character.   If  semi-colons,  close
              brackets, or white space characters (including new-
              lines)  appear  between  the  quotes  then they are
              treated as ordinary characters and included in  the
              word.  Command substitution, variable substitution,
              and backslash substitution  are  performed  on  the
              characters  between  the quotes as described below.
              The double-quotes are not retained as part  of  the
              word.

       [5]    If  the  first character of a word is an open brace
              (``{'') then the word is terminated by the matching
              close  brace (``}'').  Braces nest within the word:
              for each additional open brace  there  must  be  an
              additional  close  brace (however, if an open brace
              or close brace within the word  is  quoted  with  a
              backslash  then  it  is not counted in locating the
              matching close brace).  No substitutions  are  per-
              formed  on the characters between the braces except
              for   backslash-newline   substitutions   described
              below,   nor   do   semi-colons,   newlines,  close
              brackets, or white space receive any special inter-
              pretation.   The  word  will consist of exactly the
              characters between the outer braces, not  including
              the braces themselves.

       [6]    If a word contains an open bracket (``['') then Tcl
              performs  command  substitution.   To  do  this  it
              invokes  the Tcl interpreter recursively to process
              the characters following the open bracket as a  Tcl
              script.   The script may contain any number of com-
              mands and must be terminated  by  a  close  bracket
              (``]'').  The result of the script (i.e. the result
              of its last command) is substituted into  the  word
              in  place of the brackets and all of the characters
              between them.  There may be any number  of  command
              substitutions  in a single word.  Command substitu-
              tion is not performed on words enclosed in  braces.

       [7]    If  a  word contains a dollar-sign (``$'') then Tcl
              performs variable  substitution:   the  dollar-sign
              and  the  following  characters are replaced in the
              word by the value of a variable.  Variable  substi-
              tution may take any of the following forms:

              $name          Name  is  the name of a scalar vari-
                             able;  the name is terminated by any
                             character   that   isn't  a  letter,
                             digit, or underscore.

              $name(index)   Name gives  the  name  of  an  array
                             variable and index gives the name of
                             an element within that array.   Name
                             must  contain  only letters, digits,
                             and underscores.  Command  substitu-
                             tions,  variable  substitutions, and
                             backslash  substitutions  are   per-
                             formed on the characters of index.

              ${name}        Name  is  the name of a scalar vari-
                             able.  It may contain any characters
                             whatsoever  except for close braces.

              There may be any number of  variable  substitutions
              in  a  single  word.   Variable substitution is not
              performed on words enclosed in braces.

       [8]    If a backslash (``\'') appears within a  word  then
              backslash  substitution  occurs.   In all cases but
              those described below the backslash is dropped  and
              the  following  character is treated as an ordinary
              character and included in the  word.   This  allows
              characters  such  as double quotes, close brackets,
              and dollar signs to be included  in  words  without
              triggering special processing.  The following table
              lists the backslash sequences that are handled spe-
              cially,  along  with  the  value that replaces each
              sequence.

              \a    Audible alert (bell) (0x7).

              \b    Backspace (0x8).

              \f    Form feed (0xc).

              \n    Newline (0xa).

              \r    Carriage-return (0xd).

              \t    Tab (0x9).

              \v    Vertical tab (0xb).

              \<newline>whiteSpace
                    A single space character replaces  the  back-
                    slash, newline, and all spaces and tabs after
                    the  newline.   This  backslash  sequence  is
                    unique  in  that it is replaced in a separate
                    pre-pass  before  the  command  is   actually
                    parsed.   This means that it will be replaced
                    even when it occurs between braces,  and  the
                    resulting  space  will  be  treated as a word
                    separator if it isn't in braces or quotes.

              \\    Backslash (``\'').

              \ooo  The digits ooo (one, two, or three  of  them)
                    give the octal value of the character.

              \xhh  The  hexadecimal digits hh give the hexadeci-
                    mal value of the character.   Any  number  of
                    digits may be present.

              Backslash  substitution  is  not performed on words
              enclosed in braces, except for backslash-newline as
              described above.

       [9]    If  a  hash  character  (``#'')  appears at a point
              where Tcl is expecting the first character  of  the
              first  word  of  a command, then the hash character
              and the characters that follow it, up  through  the
              next newline, are treated as a comment and ignored.
              The comment character only has significance when it
              appears at the beginning of a command.

       [10]   Each character is processed exactly once by the Tcl
              interpreter as part of creating the words of a com-
              mand.  For example, if variable substitution occurs
              then no further substitutions are performed on  the
              value  of the variable;  the value is inserted into
              the word verbatim.  If command substitution  occurs
              then  the  nested  command is processed entirely by
              the recursive call to the Tcl interpreter; no  sub-
              stitutions  are  performed before making the recur-
              sive call and no additional substitutions are  per-
              formed on the result of the nested script.

       [11]   Substitutions  do not affect the word boundaries of
              a command.  For example, during variable  substitu-
              tion  the entire value of the variable becomes part
              of a single word, even if the variable's value con-
              tains spaces.
