       chown [-fileid] owner | {owner group} filelist
              Set  owner  of  each  file  in the list filelist to
              owner, which can be a user name or numeric user id.
              If the first parameter is a list, then the owner is
              set to the first element of the list and the  group
              is set to the second element.  Group can be a group
              name or numeric group id.  If group is {}, then the
              file  group  will  be set to the login group of the
              specified user.

              If the option -fileid is specified, filelist  is  a
              list of open file identifiers rather than a list of
              file names.  This option is not  available  on  all
              Unix systems.  Use the infox have_fchown command to
              determine if this functionality is available.

              The chown  command  is  not  available  on  Windows
              95/NT.
