NAME
       flush - Flush buffered output for a channel

SYNOPSIS
       flush channelId


DESCRIPTION
       Flushes  any  output that has been buffered for channelId.
       ChannelId must be a channel identifier such as returned by
       a  previous  open or socket command, and it must have been
       opened for writing.  If the channel is  in  blocking  mode
       the  command does not return until all the buffered output
       has been flushed to the channel. If the channel is in non-
       blocking  mode, the command may return before all buffered
       output has been flushed; the remainder will be flushed  in
       the background as fast as the underlying file or device is
       able to absorb it.
