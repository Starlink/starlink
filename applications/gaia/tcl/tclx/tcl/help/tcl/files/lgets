       lgets fileId ?varName?
              Reads  the  next  Tcl  list  from the file given by
              fileId and discards the terminating newline charac-
              ter.   This  command differs from the gets command,
              in that it reads Tcl lists rather than  lines.   If
              the  list  contains  newlines  or binary data, then
              that newline or bytes of zero will be  returned  as
              part  of  the result.  Only a newline not quoted as
              part of the list indicates the  end  of  the  list.
              There  is  no  corresponding command for outputting
              lists, as puts will do this correctly.

              If varName is specified, then the line is placed in
              the variable by that name and the return value is a
              count of the number of characters read (not includ-
              ing  the  newline).   If  the  end  of  the file is
              reached before reading any characters  then  -1  is
              returned and varName is set to an empty string.  If
              varName is specified and an error occurs, what ever
              data  was  read  will  be returned in the variable,
              however the resulting string may  not  be  a  valid
              list.

              If  varName  is not specified then the return value
              will be the line (minus the newline  character)  or
              an  empty  string if the end of the file is reached
              before reading any  characters.   An  empty  string
              will also be returned if a line contains no charac-
              ters except the newline, so eof may have to be used
              to determine what really happened.

              The  lgets  command  maybe  used  to read and write
              lists containing binary data,  however  translation
              must be set to lf or the data maybe corrupted.

              If  lgets  is  currently  supported on non-blocking
              files.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
