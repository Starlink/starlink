NAME
       set - Read and write variables

SYNOPSIS
       set varName ?value?


DESCRIPTION
       Returns the value of variable varName.  If value is speci-
       fied, then set the value of varName to value,  creating  a
       new  variable if one doesn't already exist, and return its
       value.  If varName contains an open parenthesis  and  ends
       with  a close parenthesis, then it refers to an array ele-
       ment:  the characters before the  first  open  parenthesis
       are  the name of the array, and the characters between the
       parentheses are the index  within  the  array.   Otherwise
       varName refers to a scalar variable.  Normally, varName is
       unqualified (does not include the names of any  containing
       namespaces),  and the variable of that name in the current
       namespace is read or written.  If varName includes  names-
       pace  qualifiers  (in  the  array  name if it refers to an
       array element), the variable in the specified namespace is
       read or written.

       If no procedure is active, then varName refers to a names-
       pace variable (global variable if the current namespace is
       the  global  namespace).   If  a procedure is active, then
       varName refers to a parameter or  local  variable  of  the
       procedure unless the global command was invoked to declare
       varName to be global, or unless  a  variable  command  was
       invoked to declare varName to be a namespace variable.
