NAME
       tkwait  -  Wait  for  variable  to  change or window to be
       destroyed

SYNOPSIS
       tkwait variable name

       tkwait visibility name

       tkwait window name


DESCRIPTION
       The tkwait command waits for one of several things to hap-
       pen,  then  it  returns  without taking any other actions.
       The return value is always an empty string.  If the  first
       argument  is variable (or any abbreviation of it) then the
       second argument is the name of a global variable  and  the
       command  waits  for  that variable to be modified.  If the
       first argument is visibility (or any abbreviation  of  it)
       then  the  second argument is the name of a window and the
       tkwait command waits for a change in its visibility  state
       (as indicated by the arrival of a VisibilityNotify event).
       This form is typically used to wait  for  a  newly-created
       window  to appear on the screen before taking some action.
       If the first argument is window (or  any  abbreviation  of
       it)  then  the second argument is the name of a window and
       the tkwait command waits for that window to be  destroyed.
       This  form  is typically used to wait for a user to finish
       interacting with a dialog box before using the  result  of
       that interaction.

       While the tkwait command is waiting it processes events in
       the normal fashion, so the application  will  continue  to
       respond to user interactions.  If an event handler invokes
       tkwait again, the nested  call  to  tkwait  must  complete
       before the outer call can complete.
