NAME
       event  -  Miscellaneous  event  facilities: define virtual
       events and generate events

SYNOPSIS
       event option ?arg arg ...?


DESCRIPTION
       The event command provides several facilities for  dealing
       with window system events, such as defining virtual events
       and synthesizing events.  The command has several  differ-
       ent  forms, determined by the first argument.  The follow-
       ing forms are currently supported:

       event add <<virtual>> sequence ?sequence ...?
              Associates the virtual event virtual with the phys-
              ical  event sequence(s) given by the sequence argu-
              ments, so that the virtual event will trigger when-
              ever  any one of the sequences occurs.  Virtual may
              be any string value and sequence may  have  any  of
              the values allowed for the sequence argument to the
              bind command.  If virtual is already  defined,  the
              new  physical  event  sequences add to the existing
              sequences for the event.

       event delete <<virtual>> ?sequence sequence ...?
              Deletes each of the sequences from those associated
              with  the  virtual event given by virtual.  Virtual
              may be any string value and sequence may  have  any
              of  the values allowed for the sequence argument to
              the bind  command.   Any  sequences  not  currently
              associated   with   virtual  are  ignored.   If  no
              sequence argument is provided, all  physical  event
              sequences are removed for virtual, so that the vir-
              tual event will not trigger anymore.

       event generate window event ?option value option value
              ...?
              Generates  a window event and arranges for it to be
              processed just as if it had come  from  the  window
              system.   Window  gives the path name of the window
              for which the event will be generated; it may  also
              be  an identifier (such as returned by winfo id) as
              long as it is for a window in the current  applica-
              tion.   Event  provides  a basic description of the
              event,  such  as  <Shift-Button-2>  or   <<Paste>>.
              Event  may  have  any  of the forms allowed for the
              sequence argument of the bind command  except  that
              it  must  consist  of a single event pattern, not a
              sequence.  Option-value pairs may be used to  spec-
              ify additional attributes of the event, such as the
              x and y mouse position;  see  EVENT  FIELDS  below.
              If  the -when option is not specified, the event is
              processed immediately:  all of the handlers for the
              event  will complete before the event generate com-
              mand returns.  If the  -when  option  is  specified
              then it determines when the event is processed.

       event info ?<<virtual>>?
              Returns  information  about virtual events.  If the
              <<virtual>> argument is omitted, the  return  value
              is  a  list of all the virtual events that are cur-
              rently defined.  If <<virtual>> is  specified  then
              the  return  value is a list whose elements are the
              physical event sequences currently defined for  the
              given  virtual  event;  if the virtual event is not
              defined then an empty string is returned.

              binding scripts.

       -when when
              When determines when the event will  be  processed;
              it must have one of the following values:

              now       Process the event immediately, before the
                        command returns.  This  also  happens  if
                        the -when option is omitted.

              tail      Place  the  event  on  Tcl's  event queue
                        behind any events already queued for this
                        application.

              head      Place  the  event  at  the front of Tcl's
                        event queue, so that it will  be  handled
                        before any other events already queued.

              mark      Place  the  event  at  the front of Tcl's
                        event queue but behind any  other  events
                        already  queued  with  -when  mark.  This
                        option is useful when generating a series
                        of  events  that  should  be processed in
                        order but at the front of the queue.

       -x coord
              Coord must be a screen distance;  it specifies  the
              x  field for the event.  Valid for KeyPress, KeyRe-
              lease, ButtonPress, ButtonRelease,  Motion,  Enter,
              Leave,  Expose,  Configure,  Gravity,  and Reparent
              events.  Corresponds to the the %x substitution for
              binding scripts.

       -y coord
              Coord  must be a screen distance;  it specifies the
              y field for the event.  Valid for KeyPress,  KeyRe-
              lease,  ButtonPress,  ButtonRelease, Motion, Enter,
              Leave, Expose,  Configure,  Gravity,  and  Reparent
              events.  Corresponds to the the %y substitution for
              binding scripts.

       Any options that are  not  specified  when  generating  an
       event  are  filled  with  the  value 0, except for serial,
       which is filled with the next X event serial number.


VIRTUAL EVENT EXAMPLES
       In order for a  virtual  event  binding  to  trigger,  two
       things  must  happen.   First,  the  virtual event must be
       defined with the event add  command.   Second,  a  binding
       must  be  created for the virtual event with the bind com-
       mand.  Consider the following virtual event definitions:
              event add <<Paste>> <Control-y>
              event add <<Paste>> <Button-2>
              event add <<Save>> <Control-X><Control-S>
              event add <<Save>> <Shift-F12>
       In the bind command, a virtual event can be bound like any
       other builtin event type as follows:
              bind Entry <<Paste>> {%W insert [selection get]}
       The  double angle brackets are used to specify that a vir-
       tual event is being bound.  If the user types Control-y or
       presses  button 2, or if a <<Paste>> virtual event is syn-
       thesized with event generate, then the  <<Paste>>  binding
       will be invoked.

       If a virtual binding has the exact same sequence as a sep-
       arate physical binding, then  the  physical  binding  will
       take precedence.  Consider the following example:
              event add <<Paste>> <Control-y> <Meta-Control-y>
              bind Entry <Control-y> {puts Control-y}
              bind Entry <<Paste>> {puts Paste}
       When the user types Control-y the <Control-y> binding will
       be invoked, because a physical event  is  considered  more
       specific  than  a  virtual  event,  all other things being
       equal.  However, when the user  types  Meta-Control-y  the
       <<Paste>>  binding will be invoked, because the Meta modi-
       fier in the physical pattern associated with  the  virtual
       binding is more specific than the <Control-y> sequence for
       the physical event.

       Bindings on a virtual event may be created before the vir-
       tual  event exists.  Indeed, the virtual event never actu-
       ally needs to be defined, for instance, on platforms where
       the specific virtual event would meaningless or ungenerat-
       able.

       When a definition of a virtual event changes at run  time,
       all  windows  will  respond immediately to the new defini-
       tion.  Starting from the preceding example, if the follow-
       ing code is executed:
              bind <Entry> <Control-y> {}
              event add <<Paste>> <Key-F6>
       the  behavior  will  change  such in two ways.  First, the
       shadowed <<Paste>> binding will emerge.  Typing  Control-y
       will no longer invoke the <Control-y> binding, but instead
       invoke the virtual event <<Paste>>.  Second, pressing  the
       F6 key will now also invoke the <<Paste>> binding.
