NAME
       tk_optionMenu - Create an option menubutton and its menu

SYNOPSIS
       tk_optionMenu w varName value ?value value ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  procedure creates an option menubutton whose name is
       w, plus an associated menu.  Together they allow the  user
       to  select one of the values given by the value arguments.
       The current value will be stored in  the  global  variable
       whose  name  is  given by varName and it will also be dis-
       played as the label in the option  menubutton.   The  user
       can  click  on the menubutton to display a menu containing
       all of the values and thereby select a new value.  Once  a
       new  value  is selected, it will be stored in the variable
       and appear in the option menubutton.   The  current  value
       can also be changed by setting the variable.

       The  return  value  from  tk_optionMenu is the name of the
       menu associated with w, so that the caller can change  its
       configuration options or manipulate it in other ways.
