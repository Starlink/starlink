NAME
       tk_messageBox  -  pops  up  a message window and waits for
       user response.

SYNOPSIS
       tk_messageBox ?option value ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This procedure creates and displays a message window  with
       an  application-specified  message,  an  icon and a set of
       buttons.  Each of the buttons in  the  message  window  is
       identified  by  a  unique  symbolic  name  (see  the -type
       options).  After the message window is popped up,  tk_mes-
       sageBox  waits  for the user to select one of the buttons.
       Then it returns the symbolic name of the selected  button.

       The following option-value pairs are supported:

       -default name
              Name  gives the symbolic name of the default button
              for this message window  ('ok',  'cancel',  and  so
              on).  See  -type  for a list of the symbolic names.
              If the message box has  just  one  button  it  will
              automatically  be  made  the  default, otherwise if
              this option is not specified, there  won't  be  any
              default button.

       -icon iconImage
              Specifies an icon to display. IconImage must be one
              of the following: error, info, question or warning.
              If  this option is not specified, then no icon will
              be displayed.

       -message string
              Specifies the message to display  in  this  message
              box.

       -parent window
              Makes window the logical parent of the message box.
              The message box is displayed on top of  its  parent
              window.

       -title titleString
              Specifies  a  string to display as the title of the
              message box. The default value is an empty  string.

       -type predefinedType
              Arranges for a predefined set of buttons to be dis-
              played. The following values are possible for  pre-
              definedType:

                                bolic names are abort, retry  and

              okcancel          Displays two buttons  whose  sym-
