NAME
       tk_menuBar,  tk_bindForTraversal  -  Obsolete  support for
       menu bars

SYNOPSIS
       tk_menuBar frame ?menu menu ...?

       tk_bindForTraversal arg arg ...


DESCRIPTION
       These procedures were used in Tk 3.6 and earlier  releases
       to  help  manage  pulldown menus and to implement keyboard
       traversal of menus.  In Tk 4.0 and later releases they are
       no  longer  needed.   Stubs for these procedures have been
       retained for backward  compatibility,  but  they  have  no
       effect.   You should remove calls to these procedures from
       your code, since eventually the procedures will go away.


KEYWORDS
       keyboard traversal, menu, menu bar, post
