NAME
       tk_popup - Post a popup menu

SYNOPSIS
       tk_popup menu x y ?entry?


DESCRIPTION
       This  procedure  posts  a  menu at a given position on the
       screen and configures Tk so that the menu and its cascaded
       children  can be traversed with the mouse or the keyboard.
       Menu is the name of a menu widget and x and y are the root
       coordinates  at  which  to  display the menu.  If entry is
       omitted or an empty string, the menu's upper  left  corner
       is  positioned  at the given point.  Otherwise entry gives
       the index of an entry in menu and the menu will  be  posi-
       tioned  so  that  the  entry  is positioned over the given
       point.
