NAME
       lsearch - See if a list contains a particular element

SYNOPSIS
       lsearch ?mode? list pattern


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  searches the elements of list to see if one
       of them matches pattern.  If so, the command  returns  the
       index  of the first matching element.  If not, the command
       returns -1.  The mode argument indicates how the  elements
       of  the list are to be matched against pattern and it must
       have one of the following values:

       -exact The list element  must  contain  exactly  the  same
              string as pattern.

       -glob  Pattern  is  a  glob-style pattern which is matched
              against each list element using the same  rules  as
              the string match command.

       -regexp
              Pattern  is  treated  as  a  regular expression and
              matched against each list element  using  the  same
              rules as the regexp command.

       If mode is omitted then it defaults to -glob.
