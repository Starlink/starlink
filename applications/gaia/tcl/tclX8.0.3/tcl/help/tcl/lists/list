NAME
       list - Create a list

SYNOPSIS
       list ?arg arg ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  command returns a list comprised of all the args, or
       an empty string if no  args  are  specified.   Braces  and
       backslashes get added as necessary, so that the index com-
       mand may be used on the result to re-extract the  original
       arguments,  and  also  so that eval may be used to execute
       the resulting list, with  arg1  comprising  the  command's
       name  and  the  other args comprising its arguments.  List
       produces slightly different results than  concat:   concat
       removes  one  level  of  grouping before forming the list,
       while list works directly  from  the  original  arguments.
       For example, the command
              list a b {c d e} {f {g h}}
       will return
              a b {c d e} {f {g h}}
       while concat with the same arguments will return
              a b c d e f {g h}
