       cequal string string
              This command compares two strings for equality.  It
              returns 1 if string1 and string2 are the  identical
              and 0 if they are not.  This command is a short-cut
              for string compare and  avoids  the  problems  with
              string expressions being treated unintentionally as
              numbers.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
