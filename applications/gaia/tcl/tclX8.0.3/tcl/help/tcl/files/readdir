       readdir ?-hidden? dirPath

              Returns  a  list  containing  the  contents  of the
              directory dirPath.  The directory entries  "."  and
              ".." are not returned.

              On   Windows  95/NT,  -hidden  maybe  specified  to
              include hidden files in the result.  This  flag  is
              ignored on Unix systems.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
