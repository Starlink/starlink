       recursive_glob dirlist globlist
              This   procedure  returns  a  list  of  recursively
              matches files.   All  directories  in  dirlist  are
              recursively   searched  (breadth-first),  comparing
              each file found against the file glob  patterns  in
              globlist.  Symbolic links are not followed.
