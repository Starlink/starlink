       profrep profDataVar sortKey ?outFile? ?userTitle?
              This procedure generates a report from data collect
              from the profile command.  ProfDataVar is the  name
              of  the  array  containing the data returned by the
              profile command. SortKey indicates which data value
              to  sort by.  It should be one of "calls", "cpu" or
              "real".  OutFile is the name of file to  write  the
              report to.  If omitted, stdout is assumed.  UserTi-
              tle is an optional title line to add to output.

              Listed with indentation  below  each  procedure  or
              command  is  the  procedure  call stack.  The first
              indented line being the procedure that invoked  the
              reported  procedure  or  command.  The next line is
              the procedure that invoked the procedure above  it,
              and  so  on.   If no indented procedures are shown,
              the procedure or command was called from the global
              context.  Time actually spent in the global context
              is listed on a line  labeled  <global>.   Upleveled
              code  is  reported  in the context that it was exe-
              cuted in, not the  context  that  the  uplevel  was
              called in.
