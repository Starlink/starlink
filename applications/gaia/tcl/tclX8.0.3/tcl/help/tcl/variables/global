NAME
       global - Access global variables

SYNOPSIS
       global varname ?varname ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  is  ignored unless a Tcl procedure is being
       interpreted.  If so then it declares the  given  varname's
       to  be  global  variables  rather than local ones.  Global
       variables are variables in the global namespace.  For  the
       duration  of the current procedure (and only while execut-
       ing in the current procedure), any reference to any of the
       varnames  will  refer  to  the global variable by the same
       name.
