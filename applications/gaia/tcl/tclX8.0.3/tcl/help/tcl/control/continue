NAME
       continue - Skip to the next iteration of a loop

SYNOPSIS
       continue


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  is  typically  invoked inside the body of a
       looping command such as  for  or  foreach  or  while.   It
       returns  a  TCL_CONTINUE  code,  which  causes  a continue
       exception to occur.   The  exception  causes  the  current
       script  to be aborted out to the innermost containing loop
       command, which then continues with the next  iteration  of
       the  loop.   Catch  exceptions  are  also handled in a few
       other situations, such as the catch command and the outer-
       most scripts of procedure bodies.


KEYWORDS
