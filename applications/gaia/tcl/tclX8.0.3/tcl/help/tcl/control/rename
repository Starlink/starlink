NAME
       rename - Rename or delete a command

SYNOPSIS
       rename oldName newName


DESCRIPTION
       Rename  the command that used to be called oldName so that
       it is now called newName.  If newName is an  empty  string
       then  oldName is deleted.  oldName and newName may include
       namespace qualifiers (names of containing namespaces).  If
       a  command  is  renamed into a different namespace, future
       invocations of it will execute in the new namespace.   The
       rename command returns an empty string as result.
