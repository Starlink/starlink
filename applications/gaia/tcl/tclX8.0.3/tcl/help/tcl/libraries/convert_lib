convert_lib tclIndex packagelib ?ignore?
Convert  a  Ousterhout  style  tclIndex  index file and associate
source files into a package library  packagelib.   If  packagelib
does  not  have  a .tlib extension, one will be added.  Any files
specified in tclIndex  that  are  in  the  list  ignore  will  be
skipped.   Files  listed  in  ignore should just be the base file
names, not full paths.

This procedure is provided by Extended Tcl.
