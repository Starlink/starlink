loadlibindex libfile.tlib
Load the package library index of the library file libfile (which
must have the suffix .tlib).  Package library indexes  along  the
auto_path are loaded automatically on the first demand_load; this
command is provided to explicitly load libraries that are not  in
the  path.   If  the  index  file  (with a .tndx suffix) does not
exists or is out of date, it will be  rebuilt  if  the  user  has
directory  permissions  to  create it. If a package with the same
name as a package in libfile.tlib has already  been  loaded,  its
definition  will  be  overridden by the new package.  However, if
any procedure has actually been used from the previously  defined
package, the procedures from libfile.tlib will not be loaded.

This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
