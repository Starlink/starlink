NAME
       tk_setPalette, tk_bisque - Modify the Tk color palette

SYNOPSIS
       tk_setPalette background

       tk_setPalette name value ?name value ...?

       tk_bisque


DESCRIPTION
       The  tk_setPalette  procedure changes the color scheme for
       Tk.  It does this by modifying the colors of existing wid-
       gets  and  by  changing the option database so that future
       widgets will use the new color scheme.   If  tk_setPalette
       is  invoked  with  a  single argument, the argument is the
       name of a color to use as  the  normal  background  color;
       tk_setPalette  will  compute a complete color palette from
       this background color.  Alternatively,  the  arguments  to
       tk_setPalette  may  consist  of  any  number of name-value
       pairs, where the first argument of the pair is the name of
       an  option  in the Tk option database and the second argu-
       ment is the new value to use for that option.  The follow-
       ing database names are currently supported:

              activeBackground               foregroundselectColor
              activeForeground               highlightBackgroundselectBackground
              background      highlightColor selectForeground
              disabledForeground             insertBackgroundtroughColor

       tk_setPalette tries to compute reasonable defaults for any
       options that you don't specify.  You can  specify  options
       other than the above ones and Tk will change those options
       on widgets as well.  This feature may be useful if you are
       using custom widgets with additional color options.

       Once  it has computed the new value to use for each of the
       color options, tk_setPalette scans the widget hierarchy to
       modify the options of all existing widgets.  For each wid-
       get, it checks to see if  any  of  the  above  options  is
       defined  for  the widget.  If so, and if the option's cur-
       rent value is the default, then the value is changed;   if
       the  option  has  a  value other than the default, tk_set-
       Palette will not change it.  The default for an option  is
       the  one  provided  by  the  widget ([lindex [$w configure
       $option] 3]) unless tk_setPalette has been run previously,
       in  which  case  it is the value specified in the previous
       invocation of tk_setPalette.

       After  modifying  all  the  widgets  in  the  application,
       tk_setPalette  adds  options  to  the  option  database to
       change the defaults for widgets  created  in  the  future.
       The  new  options  are added at priority widgetDefault, so
       they will be overridden by  options  from  the  .Xdefaults
       file or options specified on the command-line that creates
       a widget.

       The procedure tk_bisque is provided for backward  compati-
       bility:  it restores the application's colors to the light
       brown (``bisque'') color scheme used in Tk 3.6 and earlier
       versions.
