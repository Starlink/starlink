NAME
       tk_focusNext, tk_focusPrev, tk_focusFollowsMouse - Utility
       procedures for managing the input focus.

SYNOPSIS
       tk_focusNext window

       tk_focusPrev window

       tk_focusFollowsMouse


DESCRIPTION
       tk_focusNext is a  utility  procedure  used  for  keyboard
       traversal.  It returns the ``next'' window after window in
       focus order.  The focus order is determined by the  stack-
       ing order of windows and the structure of the window hier-
       archy.  Among siblings, the focus order is the same as the
       stacking  order, with the lowest window being first.  If a
       window has children, the window is visited first, followed
       by  its  children (recursively), followed by its next sib-
       ling.  Top-level windows other than window are skipped, so
       that  tk_focusNext  never  returns a window in a different
       top-level from window.

       After computing the next window, tk_focusNext examines the
       window's  -takefocus  option  to  see whether it should be
       skipped.  If so, tk_focusNext continues  on  to  the  next
       window  in  the  focus  order, until it eventually finds a
       window that will accept the focus or returns back to  win-
       dow.

       tk_focusPrev  is  similar  to  tk_focusNext except that it
       returns the window just before window in the focus  order.

       tk_focusFollowsMouse  changes  the  focus  model  for  the
       application to an implicit one where the window under  the
       mouse  gets  the  focus.   After this procedure is called,
       whenever the mouse enters a window Tk  will  automatically
       give it the input focus.  The focus command may be used to
       move the focus to a window other than the  one  under  the
       mouse,  but  as  soon as the mouse moves into a new window
       the focus will jump to  that  window.   Note:  at  present
       there is no built-in support for returning the application
       to an explicit focus model;  to do  this  you'll  have  to
       write  a  script  that  deletes  the  bindings  created by
       tk_focusFollowsMouse.
