NAME
       bell - Ring a display's bell

SYNOPSIS
       bell ?-displayof window?


DESCRIPTION
       This  command rings the bell on the display for window and
       returns an empty string.   If  the  -displayof  option  is
       omitted,  the  display of the application's main window is
       used by default.   The  command  uses  the  current  bell-
       related  settings  for  the display, which may be modified
       with programs such as xset.

       This command also resets the screen saver for the  screen.
       Some screen savers will ignore this, but others will reset
       so that the screen becomes visible again.
