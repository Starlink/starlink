NAME
       tkerror - Command invoked to process background errors

SYNOPSIS
       tkerror message


DESCRIPTION
       Note: as of Tk 4.1 the tkerror command has been renamed to
       bgerror because the event  loop  (which  is  what  usually
       invokes  it) is now part of Tcl.  For backward compatibil-
       ity the bgerror provided by the current Tk  version  still
       tries to call tkerror if there is one (or an auto loadable
       one), so old script defining  that  error  handler  should
       still  work,  but you should anyhow modify your scripts to
       use bgerror instead of tkerror because  that  support  for
       the old name might vanish in the near future. If that call
       fails, bgerror posts a dialog showing the error and offer-
       ing  to  see the stack trace to the user. If you want your
       own error management you should directly override  bgerror
       instead  of  tkerror.  Documentation for bgerror is avail-
       able as part of Tcl's documentation.
