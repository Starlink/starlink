  gifblock documentation
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

  A GIF file (or 'stream') is an ordered list of 'blocks'. This library
  decomposes a GIF file into a list of blocks, composes a list of blocks
  into a GIF file, and gives a couple of useful functions for inspecting
  and modifying a list of blocks.

  Each block listed is stored as a record of key-value pairs
  (see the tcl proc 'array get' and 'array set' for more information).

  A sample block:
    {
      type                     {Logical Screen Descriptor}
      width                    800
      height                   600
      {color resolution}       3
      {background color index} 255
    }

  The best way to become familiar with the block structure is to play with a
  few GIFs and dump the structure. For example:

    # List the blocks, in order, found in 'my_image.gif'
    gif.load sunset sunset.gif
    set cntr -1
    foreach name [gif.blocknames sunset] {puts "[incr cntr]: $name"}

  For those of you familiar with the GIF specification, please pay attention
  to the way the Color Table block is handled -- it is more conveniently
  coupled to the LSD and Image Descriptor blocks than in the GIF spec.

  The ORDER of blocks in the list is important. The relative order of elements
  in any given block is not.

  Each block must always have a 'type' element naming the type of the block.
  Block types and data are as follows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  type {GIF Header}
    Required. This must always be the first block in the list.
    Only one of these may appear in a list.

  version
    Optional. One of "87a" or "89a". If not given, gif.save will choose
    the appropriate version when writing the GIF file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  type {Logical Screen Descriptor}
    Required. Only one of these may appear in a list. It must always be the
    second or third block in the list, and may only be preceeded by the GIF
    Header block and an optional Color Table block.

  width
  height
    Required. The size of the GIF image. Unsigned 16-bit integers.

  color resolution
    Optional. The number of bits per primary color available
    to the original image. Defaults to 4.

  background color index
    Optional. Unsigned 8-bit integer. Defaults to 0.

  pixel aspect ratio
    Optional. The quotient of a pixel's width over its height.
    Defaults to 0 (meaning that the aspect ratio is not defined).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  type {Color Table}
    Optional. A GIF file will generally have one of these, positioned
    immediately following the GIF Header block and immediately before the
    Logical Screen Descriptor block (making it the Global Color Table).

    Color Table blocks can also be located anywhere in the list preceeding an
    Image Descriptor block, indicating that the image data refers to this
    Local Color Table and not the Global Color Table (if any).

  sorted?
    Optional. Must be true or false (any valid Tcl boolean string will do).
    If true, indicates that the Color Table lists colors with the most
    frequently used color first and the least frequently used last.
    Defaults to false.

  colors
    Required. A list of triplets of the form
      {red green blue}
    where red, green, and blue are unsigned 8-bit integers. That is, it is a
    list of colors. The length of the color table may not exceed 256.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  type {Image Descriptor}
    Optional. Image data.

  left
  top
    Optional. The location of the upper-left edge of the image in the
    Logical Screen. The upper-left corner of the Logical Screen is (0, 0).
    Unsigned 16-bit integers. Default to 0.

  width
  height
    Required. The image dimentions. Unsigned 16-bit integers.

  interlaced?
    Optional. Must be true or false (any valid Tcl boolean string will do).
    If true, the GIF Image Data is interlaced. See the GIF specification for
    more. Defaults to false.

  reserved
    Optional. Unsigned 2-bit integer. Should be 0.

  lzw minimum code size
    Required. The GIF LZW Minimum Code Size unsigned 8-bit integer value.

  data
    Required. The GIF Variable-Length-Code LZW Compressed binary image data.

  The {lzw minimum code size} and data are not modified or utilized by this
  library.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  type {Graphic Control}
    Optional. This is everyone's favorite extension block, because it is the
    one that gives GIFs a transparent color and enables GIF animations.
    See the GIF 89a specification for more information.

    This block modifies the way the next 'graphic rendering block'
    (Image Descriptor block or Plain Text block) it is to be displayed.

  reserved
    Optional. Unsigned 3-bit integer. Should be 0.

  disposal method
    Optional. Unsigned 3-bit integer. One of:
      0    No disposal method specified (default).
      1    Leave the graphic block in place after drawing it.
      2    After drawing the graphic but before drawing the next, fill the
           area used with the background color (see the Logical Screen
           Descriptor block).
      3    After drawing the graphic but before drawing the next,
           restore the area used to its prior state
           (as if the graphic had never been drawn).
      4-7  Undefined. Do not use.

  user input?
    Optional. Must be true or false (any valid Tcl boolean string will do).
    If true, the user must do something (like click a button or press a key)
    before the decoder displays the next graphic rendering block.
    Defaults to false.

    If true and a delay time is given, the decoder continues processing when
    the user gives input or the delay time times-out --whichever comes first.

  delay time
    Optional. Unsigned 16-bit integer. If non-zero, indicates the number of
    1/100 seconds to pause before drawing the next graphic rendering block.
    Defaults to 0.

  transparent color index
    Optional. If present, indicates that the specified unsigned 8-bit color
    index is to be treated as transparent. Defaults to 'not present',
    i.e. no transparency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  type Comment
    Optional. Non-displayable textual data (stuff like "this image is
    copyright (c) 2027 Spiff Industries", etc.)

  text
    Required. A string containing the textual data.
    The GIF specification does not give any clear recommendations on what
    character codes may or may not appear in a GIF Comment string, but in
    real life it is not uncommon to have newline and carriage return codes
    embedded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  type {Plain Text}
    Optional. Textual information to display.

    Be aware that not many GIF decoders properly recognize this block. For
    example, the famous Irfanview complains that the GIF is invalid when it
    is in fact properly formed. You should generally use an image block
    instead.

  left
  top
    Required. The location of the upper-left edge of the image in the
    Logical Screen. The upper-left corner of the Logical Screen is (0, 0).
    Unsigned 16-bit integers.

  width
  height
    Required. The text grid dimentions. Unsigned 16-bit integers.
    Should be a multiple of cell width and cell height, respectively.

  cell width
  cell height
    Required. The cell grid dimentions. Unsigned 8-bit integers.

  foreground color index
  background color index
    Required. Always references the Global Color Table.
    Also, a Graphic Control block may modify this block,
    so the specified index might be a transparent color index...

  text
    Required. Plain ASCII text in the range 20h..F7h (out of range characters
    are recommended to be displayed as spaces [ASCII 20h]). The text should be
    pre-formatted (with spaces) to fit the grid appropriately. For example:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |W|h|a|t|'|s|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+  -->   "What's  up?"
      | | |u|p|?| |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+        Notice the two spaces between words, so that the
                           6 by 2 grid is filled with the "up?" centered.
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |W|h|a|t|'|s|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+  -->   "What'sup?"
      |u|p|?| | | |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+        Notice the lack of spaces between words, so that
                           the text is left-justified in the 6 by 2 grid.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  type Application
    Optional. Application-specific data.

  identifier
    Required. An 8-character string identifying the data.

  authentication code
    Required. A list of three unsigned 8-bit integer values.

  datablocks
    Optional. A list of binary application data sub-blocks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  type {Extension 12}
    Optional. Any number (except 1, 249, 254, and 255).
    This is an unknown extension block.

    You can specify those other numbers if you like, but they represent the
    Plain Text, Graphic Control, Comment, and Application extension blocks,
    which are treated specially.

    The number used identifies the type of block:
        0..127  Graphic Rendering blocks (like the Plain Text and Image)
      128..249  Control blocks (like the Graphic Control)
      250..255  Special Purpose (like the Comment)

    See the GIF specification for more information.

  datablocks
    Required. A list of binary data sub-blocks.

  function reference
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gif.blocknames varName
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Return an ordered list of block types belonging to a named list of blocks.
  Most GIF files will look something like this:
    GIF Header
    Color Table
    Logical Screen Descriptor
    Graphic Control
    Image Descriptor

  See the top of this file for an example of use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gif.get varName ?type? index ?element ...?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Find an indexed block and return one or more elements.

  arguments
    varName      The name of the variable holding the list of blocks.
    type         The type of block to index.
                 If omitted, all block types are indexed.
    index        Find the (n-1)th block (of the specified type).
    element ...  One or more element names to find.

  returns
    The value of the specified element. Or
    A list of the values of the specified elements, in same order. Or
    The entire block, if no elements are specified.

  examples
    What is the width and height of the 4th image block?
      gif.get blocks {Image Descriptor} 3 width height
    --> a list, e.g.:
      320 240

    What is the type of the 3rd block (in a GIF with a Global Color Table)?
      gif.get blocks 2 type
    --> Logical Screen Descriptor

    Get the LSD screen dimentions (GIF image size):
      gif.get blocks {Logical Screen Descriptor} 0 width height
    --> a list, e.g.:
      800 600

    Get the entire 4th block, regardless of type:
      gif.get blocks 3
    Use it as an array:
      array set block [gif.get blocks 3]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gif.index varName ?type? index
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Return the absolute index of a GIF block. For example, given the blocks:
    0: GIF Header
    1: Color Table
    2: Logical Screen Descriptor
    3: Graphic Control
    4: Image Descriptor
    5: Graphic Control
    6: Image Descriptor
  then:       gif.index blocks {Logical Screen Descriptor} 0
  returns:    2
  and:        gif.index blocks {Image Descriptor} 1
  returns:    6

  See also gif.get

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gif.save varName filename
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Compile the blocks listed with the named variable and write them to a GIF
  file named as given by filename. Always overwrites.

  Be aware that
    gif.load blocks one.gif
    gif.save blocks two.gif

  may produce a GIF file (two.gif) that is binary distinct from the original
  GIF file (one.gif). This is because image data (and some other sub-blocks)
  are unpacked by gif.load and re-packed by gif.save. Gif.make always packs
  sub-blocks optimally, whereas some encoders may not. The resultant GIF file
  (two.gif) is valid and produces identically to the source GIF file
  (one.gif).

  All this means is that if you unpack and repack a GIF file using this
  library you might end-up with a smaller GIF than you began with.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gif.load varName filename
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Read the named GIF file and set the named variable to the list of blocks.

  See the top of this file for an example of use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gif.set varName ?type? index element ?value? ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Index an element of a block the same way as gif.get and set one or more
  element values. If no value is specified, the named element is removed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gif.add varName block
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Add a new block by copying an existing one. Obtain the block
  using gif.get.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gif.createGC varName ?delay?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Create a Graphic Control block and append to the GIF. 
  Delay in 1/100 of second.
