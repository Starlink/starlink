	XML Support For Tcl

	TclXML Version 3.1

Steve Ball, Explain

This package provides XML parsers for Tcl scripts.  There is a generic
front-end interface with plugin parser implementations.  A number of parser
implementations or wrappers are provided:

    *     James Clark's expat library.  This package is known as TclXML/expat.

    *     Gnome libxml2 library.  This package is known as TclXML/libxml2.

    *     A generic Tcl implementation (which does not require compilation).  This
    package is known as TclXML/tcl.


The package defines commands in the ::xml Tcl namespace:

xml::parserclass info names


xml::parser


Other packages are also supplied to provide support for related standards.  In
particular, work has commenced on the 'xpath' package for parsing XPath
location paths.

See the website [http://tclxml.sourceforge.net/] for more information on XML
support for Tcl.

this release.



Installation
============

TclXML v3.1 features a pure-Tcl installer.

    Future work on the installer will include an 'uninstall' capability, as well as
    the capability to build the binary libraries in the package from the source.



Dependencies
------------

Tcllib
    http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcllib/ [http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcllib/]

    In order for the Tcl-only parser to resolve external entities, the tcllib
    package must be installed.

    Be sure to get a version which includes the uri package.  Version 1.2 or better
    is recommended.

        *         GZip'd tarball [ftp://prdownloads.sf.net/tcllib/tcllib-1.3.tar.gz]

        *         ZIP file [ftp://prdownloads.sf.net/tcllib/tcllib-1.3.zip]


    The latest CVS snapshot may be found at the SourceForge project page
    [http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcllib].



Expat
    Expat is only required for the compiled version of the TclXML/expat package.

    TclXML/expat requires expat v0.2, with modifications by Ajuba Solutions.  This
    is now supplied in the expat subdirectory of this distribution and will
    maintained until TclXML has been resynchronised with the Expat SourceForge
    project (volunteer needed!).



libxml2
    libxml2 is only required for the compiled version of the TclXML/libxml2
    package.  libiconv may also be required.

    The source code for libxml2 and libiconv is not supplied with this package.
     Download libxml2 from xmlsoft.org [http://xmlsoft.org/] separately, and
    libiconv from a GNU mirror site.

    Version 2.6.9 (or better) is recommended.





Pure-Tcl Installation (no compilation required)
-----------------------------------------------

The install.tcl script will install the pure-Tcl parser.  Run it using wish, eg.

    wish install.tcl

    If Tcl/Tk has been configured correctly on your system, you should be able to
    simply double-click the script.

If the pure-Tcl parser is good enough for you, then read no further.



Compiled Installation
---------------------



Unix/Linux
----------

You must have Tcl/Tk version 8.2 or better installed on your system.  Tcl/Tk
8.3 or better is recommended.

Make sure you have Tcllib 1.2 (or better) installed.  Tcllib is still required,
even for the compiled parser.

If you wish to use TclXML/libxml2, make sure libxml2-2.6.9 (or better) is
installed.

Unpack the TclXML distribution and cd into the tclxml-3.1 directory.

Run the configure script, with the --prefix and --enable-threads switches (the
latter only if Tcl has been built with threads enabled).  For example, on my
system I have Tcl 8.4 installed in /usr/local/tcl8.4 so I would use the command:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/tcl8.4 --enable-threads

    make

    Don't test the package using make test until all of the packages are installed
    (it is a current deficiency of the build system that the individual modules
    cannot be tested before installation - we hope to fix this soon!).

    make install

You may need to do this as root.  This installs the pure-Tcl parser class, as
well as support files required for the next step.

    cd expat

Now TclXML/expat is about to be built.

Use exactly the same configure command from step (4) above.

    make

    make install

You may need to do this as root.  This installs the expat parser class.

    cd ../libxml2

Now TclXML/libxml2 is about to be built.  Remember, you must have built and
installed libxml2 first.

Use exactly the same configure command from step (4) above.

    make

    make install

You may need to do this as root.  This installs the libxml2 parser class.

    cd ..; make test



Windows (MS VC++)
-----------------

    [Advice:  ActiveTcl includes binaries for TclXML.]

You must have Tcl/Tk version 8.2 or better installed on your system.  Tcl/Tk
8.3 or better is recommended.

Before starting, download the binaries for libxml2 (or build them from source).
 xmlsoft [http://xmlsoft.org/] has a link to the MS Windows binary distribution.

If you have a TEA build environment setup, just use the normal
configure/make/make install pattern.

Alternatively, the win subdirectory contains a makefile.vc file for Visual
Studio C++ v6.0.  This makefile builds both the expat and libxml2 parser
classes.  In a Command Prompt window set up your environment so that nmake is
on the path (by running VCVARS32.BAT), then type the following:

    nmake -f makefile.vc TCLDIR=C:\Path\To\Tcl INSTALLDIR=C:\Path\To\Tcl LIBZDIR=C:\Path\To\libz LIBICONVDIR=C:\Path\To\libiconv LIBXML2DIR=C:\Path\To\libxml2

As an example, on my system I have Tcl installed in C:\Tcl and the libxml2
binaries unpacked in the directory C:\gnome.  Accordingly, I would use the
following command line:

    nmake -f makefile.vc TCLDIR=C:\Tcl INSTALLDIR=C:\Tcl LIBZDIR=C:\gnome\zlib-1.1.4.win32 LIBICONVDIR=C:\gnome\libiconv-1.9.1.win32 LIBXML2DIR=C:\gnome\libxml2-2.6.9.win32

Install the package by appending 'install' to the command line used above, for
example:

    nmake -f makefile.vc TCLDIR=C:\Path\To\Tcl INSTALLDIR=C:\Path\To\Tcl LIBZDIR=C:\Path\To\libz LIBICONVDIR=C:\Path\To\libiconv LIBXML2DIR=C:\Path\To\libxml2 install



Macintosh OS X
--------------

There are two ways to build TclXML under Mac OS X:

The usual Unix way, see above.

As an embedded Framework using Xcode.

The macosx directory contains the Xcode files for building under OS X
(Panther).  TclXML has been tested on OS X 10.3 (or is that X.3?).

Start-up the project.  Make sure that the references to the libxml2 and Tcl
external frameworks are correct.  Select the 'Make' target and build.  This
builds everything.  The result is six Mac OS X Frameworks; three "normal" and
three "embedded".  The embedded frameworks will be in the embedded subdirectory
of the Build Products directory.  Copy tclxml.framework,
TclXMLlibxml2.framework and expat.framework to any of the usual places for
frameworks (~/Library/Frameworks, /Library/Frameworks, etc).

For earlier version of OS X using Project Builder, you will have to retrieve a
previous version of the Project Builder files from the CVS repository.



Macintosh OS 9 (or earlier)
---------------------------

The installer script doesn't work properly on Macintosh yet, and the binary
parsers have not been ported yet (sorry).

Since the distribution has an all-Tcl parser, you can get a working parser
fairly easily.

Copy the library folder to the Tcl library folder in the Extensions folder of
the System folder.

Rename the library folder to tclxml3.1.  This isn't strictly necessary, but it
helps keep things organised.

You're on your own as far as the demos, programs and documentation go.



Usage
=====

See the website for links to tutorials and the reference manual.

In the meantime, here's a quick tutorial:

    
    package require xml
    
    set parser [xml::parser]
    $parser configure -elementstartcommand EStart \
        -characterdatacommand PCData
    
    proc EStart {tag attlist args} {
        array set attr $attlist
        puts "Element \"$tag\" started with [array size attr] attributes"
    }
    
    proc PCData text {
        incr ::count [string length $text]
    }
    
    set count 0
    $parser parse [read stdin]
    
    puts "The document contained $count characters"
    exit 0




XPath
=====

In addition to XML parsing packages, TclXML also provides a package for parsing
XPath location paths.  The XPath package only parsing the path's syntax, it
does interpret the path.  See TclDOM
[http://tclxml.sourceforge.net/tcldom.html] for a package that will interpret
XPath location paths.

    This package is in its infancy, and does not support the full range of XPath
    features.  Only a very limited subset of location paths are supported, of the
    form "/simple/example[2]".  Paths within predicates will definitely fail.

To use the XPath package:

    
    package require xpath


To parse a location path:

    
    xpath::split {/simple/example}


This returns a Tcl list, each element of which is a three element sublist:
{axis node-test {?predicate ...?}}.
