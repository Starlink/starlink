    <p>
      GAIA is capable of using much of the increasingly large amounts of
      information available at astronomy data-centres distributed around the
      world.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way that GAIA accesses on-line information is two-fold for
      historical reasons. Using the older SkyCat facilities a preset list of
      useful catalogues and images are available for query, whereas using the
      newer Virtual Observatory query mechanisms an ever-expanding set of
      resources is available. Access to both these query mechanisms is found
      in the "Data-Servers" menu.

    <h3>Local catalogues</h3>
    <p>Local catalogues are contained in files held on your local
      computer. These are opened using the "Open" item in the "File" menu,
      or by the "Local Catalogues" sub-menu in the "Data-Servers" menu (this
      is available in the main window and in the catalogue window). Local
      catalogues can be created by saving remote ones to disk (this is a
      good idea when you have slow or intermittent internet access), or they
      can be created by other programs (such as SExtractor -- SUN/225).

    <p>The native format of local catalogues is called "tab-table". This
      is a simple, plain-text, format that is described in the GAIA User
      Note (SUN/214, the command <tt>showme sun214</tt> may display
      this in your web browser).

    <p>As well as this format (which is the most efficient to use), local
      catalogues can be stored in any format accessible by the CURSA
      (SUN/190) package (this includes FITS-tables), and the "ASCII_HEAD"
      format used by the SExtractor package.

    <p>It is also possible to "import" plain text files (that is ones that
      are space, comma or fixed width separated) and display them as
      catalogues. To do this you need to use the "Import plain text file..."
      toolbox that is found in the "Positions..." sub menu of the
      "Image-Analysis" menu. There is some specific help about the toolbox
      that performs the import:

    </ul>

    <h3>Finding out more</h3>
    <p>If you'd like to know more about the "Data-Servers" menu then look
      in the "Help" menu on the main window and select "SkyCat...". This
      should start up netscape and take you to the WWW Skycat page at
      ESO. There's a FAQ and some other information. The description of how
      the WCS system works is largely correct, but GAIA uses a different
      back-end (the Starlink AST library) which supports more formats and
      the NDF WCS component. You should also note that GAIA may not be using
      the latest version of SkyCat, so everything described there may not be
      available.

    <p>A rather more pointed description of how catalogues are served over
      the web (and how to provide your own) is given in Starlink System Note
      75 (SSN/75). This may be available on your local machine, or from
      Starlink (try "http://www.starlink.ac.uk/docs/ssn75.htx/ssn75.html").
