    <p>
      There are two basic methods to get a copy of what is displayed in the
      main window -- printing to postscript (which can be sent to a local
      printer or captured to a file) and taking a <tt>snapshot</tt> which 
      can be saved in GIF, JPEG, TIFF or PNG formats.
    <p>
      To get a copy of the whole image, including any parts that are
      off-screen, you can only use a <tt>snapshot</tt>, but this option does
      allow images to be captured at full, or greater, resolution.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>Getting a snapshot of the image and overlay graphics</h3>
    <p>
      This is just like taking a snapshot of the window using a tool like
      GIMP, so requires that the window is unobscured and only creates
      graphics at the same resolution as the screen (printing to postscript
      does not have this limitation for overlay graphics), to do that select
      the "Visible snapshot..." or "Full snapshot..." items in the "File"
      menu, depending on whether you want just the visible parts or all the
      image and off-screen graphics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The format of the graphics file produced is PNG by default, but will be
      one of the other supported formats if the selected filename has a known
      extension (<tt>.gif</tt>, <tt>.jpeg</tt>, <tt>.jpg</tt>, <tt>.png</tt>,
      <tt>.tiff</tt> or <tt>.tif</tt>).
    </p>

    <h3>Postscript print of image and overlay graphics</h3> 
    <p>
      To get a postscript printout of what GAIA is displaying you need to use
      the "Print...", "Image..." item in the "File" menu. This creates a
      dialog window as shown below. Choose the options that you require and
      press "Print" (this will be spooled to a local printer by default).

    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      To get a basic colour encapsulated postscript file for inclusion in
      another document, select "Color", "Landscape" or "Portrait",
      "Encapsulated Postscript" and "Print to File:". Now enter the output
      file name and press "Print". The result can be viewed using a postscript
      viewer like ghostscript (usually the command "gv" or "gs").
    </p>

    <p>
      The "Print whole window" option should be selected if you require a copy
      of all the window, <i>including</i> any graphics that fall off the image
      itself (say any axis labels drawn as part of a grid overlay). If you use
      this option you should probably also set the background colour of the
      image to white (do this using the "Image background" item in the "View"
      menu).
    </p>
    <p align=center>
      <img src="gridps.gif">
    </p>
    <br>
      
    <p>
      When you print, you can only get a copy of what you can see, any parts
      of the image (or graphics) that are not visible cannot be included in
      the final print (naturally this also applies to capturing). This means
      that you should arrange the image view carefully (see the 
      <a href="display.html">display control</a> topic for advice on maximising
      the visible area).
    </p>

    <p>
      Another limitation is that the image is printed at the viewable
      resolution, but unlike capturing the overlay graphics are printed using
      vector graphics, so should always display at the printer resolution.  If
      the limited image resolution is a problem you'll need to print your
      image some other way -- such as using the "psfcol_p" or "epsfcol_p"
      output devices together with the KAPPA DISPLAY program.
    </p>

    <h3>Postscript print of the colour ramp</h3>
    <p>
      To get a representation of the colour ramp and how its values map to
      your image data values use the "Print...", "Ramp..." item in the "File
      menu". This produces a dialog similar to the image printing one:
    </p>
    <p align=center>
      <img src="rampprint.gif">
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Using this you can create a encapsulated postscript file for inclusion
      with your image. The end result should look something like:
    </p>
    <p align=center>
      <img src="rampps.gif">
