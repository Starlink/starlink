    <h3>What is SAMP?</h3>
    <p>
      SAMP stands for Simple Application Messaging Protocol. It is a protocol
      which allows tools on the desktop to communicate with each other.  Very
      briefly, the way it works is that applications can send messages to a
      central \mytt{hub process} which will then pass them on to other
      applications which can respond to them in some appropriate way.  GAIA
      can use SAMP to send and receive images, sky position information, and
      catalogues or identification of rows within them.  It can also send
      extracted spectra.  You will require a hub, either free-standing or
      integral to some other application, to use these capabilities.
    <p>
    <p>
      Applications which currently talk SAMP include
      <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/">TOPCAT</a>,
      <a href="http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/aladin.gml">Aladin</a>
      and various tools from the
      <a href="http://software.astrogrid.org/">AstroGrid project</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find more information about how it works, what applications are
      compatible, and how it can be useful at the <a
      herf="http://www.ivoa.net/samp">SAMP</a> web page.
    </p>


    <h3>How do I use GAIA with SAMP?</h3>

    <p>
      In order for SAMP communications to work, a SAMP hub must be running on
      your machine.  This is not part of GAIA and you will have to start it up
      separately.  The recommended way to do this is currently to run the
      <strong>AstroGrid Workbench</strong>, which can be started using Java
      WebStart by following links on the 
      <a href="http://software.astrogrid.org/">AstroGrid website</a>.
      A SAMP hub can also be started from the TOPCAT application.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the hub is running when GAIA starts up, GAIA will connect to it
      ("register") automatically.  If you start the hub while GAIA is already
      running, you can connect to it by selecting the <tt>Register</tt> option
      from GAIA's <tt>Interop</tt> menu.  When registered, GAIA will listen
      out for messages from other applications and act on them.  You will also
      be able to send messages to other applications.  If you want to stop
      GAIA responding to any such messages, you can select <tt>Unregister</tt>
      from the same menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      In most cases, sending a SAMP message from GAIA is controlled using one
      of its <tt>Interop</tt> menus.  For a given action these often have two
      ways to transmit a given message: <tt>Broadcast ...</tt> and <tt>Send to
      ...</tt>.  For <tt>Broadcast</tt>, all registered applications which
      understand it are invited to do something with the message.  For
      <tt>Send to</tt> there is a submenu which allows you to choose which
      single application to direct the message to.  Only applications which
      claim to understand the particular message will appear on such submenus
      (which means that this submenu may be empty, depending on what other
      SAMP-aware tools you've got running).
    </p>

    <h3>What SAMP facilities does GAIA support?</h3>

    <p>
      GAIA can both send and respond to messages in two general application
      areas: image-related and catalogue-related.  The messages and how to use
      them are listed below; the <i>MTypes</i> (strings in parentheses) are
      the formal identifiers for these messages - if you are not an
      applications programmer you can ignore these.
    </p>

    <h4>Image-Related Facilities</h4>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Load image</b> (<code>image.load.fits</code>)</dt>
      <dd>If an image is sent from another SAMP application to GAIA, it will
      be displayed in GAIA's existing base image window.  You can send an
      image from one of GAIA's windows to one or all of the other registered
      applications by using the "Broadcast/Send Image" options in the
      "Interop" menu on the relevant image window.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Highlight Position</b> (<code>coord.pointAt.sky</code>)</dt>
      <dd>If a Highlight Position message is received from another
      application, it will plot a marker (green circle) at the indicated spot
      on GAIA's base image window, as long as the point falls within the
      bounds of the currently displayed image.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Catalogue-Related Facilities</h4>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Load catalogue</b> (<code>table.load.votable</code>)</dt>

      <dd>If a table is received from another application, it will appear as a
      new <a href="query.html">catalogue query window</a> associated with
      GAIA's base image window.  Any positions it contains which are within
      the bounds of the current image will be plotted as symbols over the
      image as symbols.  This window will have an <tt>Interop</tt> menu which
      can be used for communicating information about one or more selected
      rows within the table between GAIA and other SAMP applications which
      have a copy of it.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Highlight Selection</b>(<code>table.select.rowList</code>)</dt>

      <dd>If another application sends this message concerning a catalogue
      which has already been sent over SAMP, the current selection for that
      catalogue will change, both the rows visible in the query window and the
      symbols plotted on the image.  You can send a selection of points from
      the catalogue window to other applications displaying the same catalogue
      using its <tt>Interop</tt> menu: the <tt>Broadcast/Send current
      search</tt> options send all the visible rows, and <tt>Broadcast/Send
      current selection</tt> send only the currently selected ones (rows
      highlighted in blue in the query window).
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Highlight Row</b> (<code>table.highlight.row</code>)</dt>

      <dd>If the query window's Interop menu has the <tt>Selection broadcasts
      row index</tt> checkbox ticked, then if you select a single row either
      by clicking on it in the query window or by clicking on its symbol in
      the image, this message will be sent to other applications to invite
      them to highlight that row.  Similarly, if other applications send
      similar messages about this to GAIA, it will respond by highlighting the
      relevant row and symbol.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Highlight Position</b> (<code>coord.pointAt.sky</code>)</dt>

      <dd>If the query window's Interop menu has the <tt>Selection broadcasts
      row position</tt> checkbox ticked, then the sky position associated with
      the row will be broadcast to other applications when a single row is
      selected.  They may respond by highlighting that position on their own
      sky images.  Note that unlike the other catalogue-related messages, this
      may have an effect for applications which don't have the same catalogue
      loaded.
      </dd>

    <p>
      PLASTIC support has been withdrawn from GAIA. Use SAMP instead.
