<h3>Reading coordinates</h3>
<p>If you have an image with an appropriate set of FITS headers (from
say the Digital Sky Survey, or other on-line sources of images) or an
NDF with a defined WCS component, then will GAIA display the current
coordinates in the Alpha and Delta readouts.<br>

<p>
You view coordinates in all the built-in systems using the 
<a href="alldomains.html">Show all coordinates toolbox</a>.


<h3>Getting offsets between positions</h3>
<p>To see the RA and Dec offsets between two positions just place your
cursor over an object and then press and hold down button 3. Now move
the mouse to another point on the image and the offsets between then
will be shown using a rubber band ruler.<br>

<h3>Plotting grid overlays</h3>
<p>If your image is displaying RA and Dec values then you can also
plot a grid overlaid on it (actually you can also just use plain pixel
coordinates). Just open the "Image-Analysis" menu and select the
"Overlay axes..." item. This creates a new toolbox with many options
for controlling the appearance of the grid.

<p>Help with using the grid plotting toolbox is available:

</ul>

<h3>Changing the coordinate system</h3>
<p>If you need to change the coordinate system of your image (so that for
instance it shows positions in FK4 instead of FK5, or if you'd like to
measure a Galactic position) then you can do this using the "Celestial
coordinates..." and "Built-in coordinates..." toolboxes. 

The difference between changing the celestial coordinates and built-in
ones, is that you can request any celestial system supported, as along
as your image has at least one celestial system already. Whereas the
built-in ones are just those present in whatever calibration your
image has (for FITS this tends to be just grid coordinates and your
initial celestial system, for NDFs there can be many additional
systems, like pixel coordinates).

<h3>Astrometrically calibrating images</h3>
<p>GAIA offers you a great deal of flexibility in setting and checking
your image's astrometry information (that is the information used to
define how positions on your image correspond to positions on the
sky). There are four main toolboxes associated with this
activity. Usage hints are available for each, but read this
overview section first.
<ul>
<li><a href="reference.html">Fit to reference stars toolbox</a>.
<li><a href="refine.html">Tweak existing calibration toolbox</a>.
<li><a href="define.html">Enter an known calibration toolbox</a>.
<li><a href="copy.html">Copy from another image toolbox</a>.
</ul>

<h4>How to check your astrometry is correct</h4>
<p>If you want to check the astrometry of your image then you can
compare any reference positions that you have (from say published
catalogues) with your image by simply pointing at the position on the
image and reading off the sky coordinates. You can also use the
on-line catalogues available under the "Data-Servers" menu in the main
window. These will draw markers on your image at the positions of any
objects that are located.

<p>You can also plot a grid overlay (see above), from which you can
estimate the directions of the local axes, read-off separations
etc. You can also get the distance between any two points on your
image (in arc minutes), by using the rubber band ruler (see above).

<h4>Calibrating your image</h4>
<p>If you need to calibrate your image astrometry, then you can go
about this in several different ways:
<ol>
<li>Use a set of reference positions to estimate a fit to your data.</li>
<li>Copy a calibration from a related image (which lies near to
    your current position on the sky).</li>
<li>Define the calibration using standard descriptions (this
    needs at least a knowledge of the image scale and the
    coordinates of a reference position).</li>
</ol>
The calibration that you achieve using methods 2 and 3 needn't be very
accurate as you can "tweak" the calibration by using new reference
positions (obtained from say on-line catalogues) to generate any
additional transformations, or, you can completely redo the fit using
method 1 and these extra positions.

<p>Suitable reference positions are easy to get in GAIA as you can
query on-line catalogues, such as the Guide Star Catalogue (GSC) or US
Naval Office catalogue (USNO) or you can use a pre-calibrated
reference image (such as a DSS image) to select fiducial marks
(i.e. stars and galaxies). The main idea is to get things good enough
so that you can recognize the objects that are displayed from the
catalogue (you can then proceed to move the projected reference
positions until they are in the correct place and completely redo the
fit).

<p>The most likely starting point given an uncalibrated image is to
display it then retrieve a DSS image of the same part of the sky, in
another window, then use the "Fit to star positions..." toolbox to
transfer reference positions from the DSS image. These positions can
then be used to initiate a first pass calibration.

<p>Now query the USNO catalogue and overlay all the objects that it
has, remove the obvious mistakes (blends etc.) and redo the fit. More
accurate solutions can be done if you select background galaxies.

<p>As you can probably see by now it is valid to mix and match the
ways of calibrating your data, you just pick a method or scheme that
suits your particular data.

<h4>Saving the calibration with your image</h4>
<p>To retain any calibration changes that you make you must save the
displayed image to disk (using the "Save as..." item in the "File"
menu in the main window). Once saved you can then re-read the image
into GAIA and the calibration should be available again (note that
this may not work with other software, see the next topic).

<h3>Types of astrometry information</h3>
<p>GAIA uses the Starlink AST library (SUNs 210 and 211) to do its
astrometry. This means that it can read many different types of
astrometry information stored in FITS headers, such as those
"standards" used by AIPS, the newer FITS-WCS system (see
http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/wcs.html) and the DSS. AST
will also read astrometry information stored in its own native
form. This may be available with NDFs, or FITS images you've saved
using GAIA.

<p>This is all very useful, but there is a problem when it comes to
writing out new astrometric calibrations or modification of existing
astrometries. The problem is that it is not always possible to convert
the AST native form (which is what is being used when a calibration is
being created or tweaked) into a FITS representation of some kind
(GAIA always attempts this).

<p>Obviously if the calibration is not written out using FITS then
this limits the possibilities of using this information in other
astronomical software (in fact using FITS-WCS as a storage form is
also potentially problematic, as it is not yet a standard and is still
quite new). The only way to see if your calibration can be converted
to FITS is to try and save the image. If it fails then you'll get a
warning message. If this is a real concern to you then you can
increase the chances of this conversion being successful if you define
a new calibration (the chances of writing out a modified DSS
calibration are very small) and keep the modifications (i.e. the fit
solution, or tweak) as simple as possible.

<p>If you are just using GAIA (and possibly other Starlink software
that uses AST) then you'll always be able to save and restore your
astrometry as GAIA always saves an AST native copy with your image.

<h2>Health Warning</h2>
<p>Getting an accurate astrometric solution to an image requires some
effort, you should always check that the solution found is good enough
for your purposes. Currently GAIA has no facilities for correcting for
plate distortions.
