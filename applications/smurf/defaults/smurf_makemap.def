#  Purpose:
#     Default parameters for SMURF application MAKEMAP.

#  Description:
#     This file specifies default values for all parameters for the
#     MAKEMAP iterative map-maker. The main purpose of this file is
#     to define the complete list of all legal parameters, with initial
#     values. Users will be notified if they specify parameter names that
#     are not included in this file. This helps to guard against spelling
#     mistakes, etc, on the part of the user.

#  Notes:
#     - The parameters are listed in alphabetical order in this file.
#     - Different defaults can be specified for 450 and 850 um by
#     including the parameter name twice, prefixed with "450." and "850."

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.gaussbg
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0.0
#  Purpose: 	Reduces spurious large scale structure in the final map - an
#               experimental alternative to AST masking
#  Description: If ast.gaussbg is non-zero, the background in the map will
#        	be determined at the end of each iteration by smoothing
#    		the map with a 2D Gaussian point spread function. This
#     		background is then subtracted from the map before sampling
#     		the map to form the AST model to be used on the next
#     		iteration. The non-zero value specifies the full-width at
#     		half-maximum of the Gaussian in arc-seconds.  The purpose
#     		is to remove large scale redundant structures from the map
#     		without resorting to masking.
ast.gaussbg = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.mapspike
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	10.0
#  Purpose: 	Removes spikes from the map.
#  Description: If ast.mapspike is non-zero, spikes in the time-series
#		residuals will be identified by looking at the spread of
#		residual values that contribute to each map pixel. Any
#		residuals that are above ast.mapspike standard deviations
#		from the mean value in the pixel are flagged as spikes.
ast.mapspike = 10

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.skip
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Skip subtraction of astronomical signal.
#  Description: If ast.skip is non-zero, it gives the number of initial
#       iterations for which no AST model (astronomical signal) should
#       be subtracted. A map is still formed at the end of these iterations
#       but the astronomical signal implied by this map is not removed from
#       the residuals (neither is it added back prior to forming the next
#       map). This means that the residuals at the start of each of these
#       iterations are unchanging and essentially equal to the cleaned raw
#       data.
#
#       This option is useful when using SNR-based masking for the FLT and/or
#       COM models, since it allows a reasonable mask to be formed before
#       subtracting off the first estimate of the astronommical signal.
ast.skip = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.zero_circle
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	<undef>
#  Purpose: 	Reduces spurious large scale structure in the final map
#		outside a circle of given radius.
#  Description: Using ast.zero_circle defines a circle on the map outside
#		of which the map will be constrained to zero on each
#               iteration (but see parameter "ast.zero_notlast"). If a value
#		is supplied for this parameter, it can be a single real value,
#		or a comma-separated list of three real values in parentheses.
#		If one value is supplied, it should be the radius of the
#		circle in decimal degrees (the centre of the circle defaults
#		to the coordinates at the tangent point of the map). If three
#		values are supplied they should be the central longitude,
#		latitude and radius of the circle, in decimal degrees, in the
#		coordinate system of the map (e.g., RA and Dec.).
ast.zero_circle = <undef>

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.zero_freeze
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Prevent the AST mask from changing after a given number
#		of iterations. This can help convergence.
#  Description: If ast.zero_freeze is non-zero, the AST mask will be frozen
#		after the specified number of iterations. A value of zero
#		means that the mask is never frozen. Note, any initial
#               iterations specified by parameter "ast.skip" are not
#               included in the count of iterations.
ast.zero_freeze = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.zero_lowhits
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Reduces spurious large scale structure in the final map
#		in regions containing few data samples.
#  Description: Using ast.zero_lowhits causes the map to be forced to
#		zero in regions where the number of samples falling in
#		each pixel is less than ast.zero_lowhits times the mean
#               number of samples per pixel, averaged over the map. A
#               value of zero means that no masking of low hits regions
#		is performed. The mask is updated on each iteration.
ast.zero_lowhits = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.zero_mask
#  Type: 	integer or string
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Reduces spurious large scale structure in the final map
#		within fixed regions specified by an external mask.
#  Description: If ast.zero_mask is set to one of "REF", "MASK2" or
#		"MASK3" then an NDF will be obtained using the specified
#		ADAM parameter (REF, MASK2 or MASK3) and used as a
#		user-defined mask. Setting ast.zero_mask to an integer value
#		larger than zero has the same effect as setting it to "REF".
#		Setting it to an integer less than or equal to zero results
#		in no external mask being used with the AST model. Note,
#		using "REF" ensures that the mask and the output image of
#		MAKEMAP are on the same pixel grid - using "MASK2" or "MASK3"
#		does not provide this guarantee (it is then the users
#		responsibility to ensure that the supplied masks are aligned
# 		with the output image in pixel coordinates). The pixels in
#		the map that are to be constrained to 0 should be set to the
#		bad value in the mask. All other pixels will be allowed to
#		vary during map-making.
ast.zero_mask = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.zero_niter
#  Type: 	int
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Allows AST masking to be switched off after a given
#		number of iterations.
#  Description: If ast.zero_niter is non-zero, it gives the number of
#		iterations for which the AST model should be masked.
#		Subsequent iterations are not masked. A value of zero
#		means "mask on all iterations". However, if parameter
#		"ast.zero_notlast" is set, the mask will will not be
#		applied on the last iteration, even if ast.zero_niter
#		is zero. This feature will probably be useful for deep
#		point-source observations for which the large-scale noise
#		is not as important, but keeping as much data around the
#		edges of the map is. Note, any initial iterations
#               specified by parameter "ast.skip" are not included in
#               the count of iterations.
ast.zero_niter = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.zero_notlast
#  Type: 	int
#  Default: 	1
#  Purpose: 	Allows flux to be present in masked areas in the final map.
#  Description: If ast.zero_notlast is 1, then the map is not masked on
# 		the final iteration. This means that data samples that fall
#            	outside the masked areas are allowed to remain in the final
#               map. If ast.zero_notlast is 0, then the map is masked even on
#               the final iteration, meaning that the masked areas will
#		be zero in the final map.
ast.zero_notlast = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.zero_snr
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0.0
#  Purpose: 	Reduces spurious large scale structure in the final map
#		within regions of low signal-to-noise.
#  Description: The ast.zero_snr parameter will mask the map after each
#		iteration based on the the signal to noise ratio within
#		each map pixel. For example, if it is set to 5, after each
#		iteration all map pixels with an SNR below this threshold
#		will be forced to zero. the mask is re-evaluated on each
#		iteration. An ast.zero_snr value of zero means no SNR mask
#		is used.
ast.zero_snr = 0.0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.zero_snr_fwhm
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0.0
#  Purpose: 	Can help to remove bowls around sources.
#  Description: If ast.zero_snr_fwhm is non-zero, the map-maker produces
#           	two maps: the first is created normally using the mask
#		specified by parameter "ast.zero_snr". The final SNR-based
#		mask associated with this map is then smoothed using a
#		Gaussian with FWHM equal to the ast.zero_snr_fwhm value (in
#		arcsec). The whole iterative map-making process is then
#		run again from the start, using this smoothed mask on every
#		iteration, to create the final map. Consequently, setting
#		ast.zero_snr_fwhm causes the time taken to create the final
#		map to nearly double.
ast.zero_snr_fwhm = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.zero_snr_low
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	-1.1
#  Purpose: 	Can help to remove bowls around sources.
#  Description: The ast.zero_snr_low parameter gives the value (in the range
#		0.0 to 1.0) at which to threshold the smoothed mask specified
#		by parameter "ast.zero_snr_fwhm". If it is negative, the value
#		is taken as the max smoothed value of a blob containing
#		"ast.zero_snr_low" pixels. Thus a value of "-1.1" will cut at
#		a height just sufficient to remove blobs of a single pixel
#		form the mask. A value of "-2.1" would remove blobs of two
#		pixels form the mask, etc.
ast.zero_snr_low = -1.1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.zero_snrlo
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Can help to remove bowls around sources by increasing the
#		size of the SNR mask without introducing noise.
#  Description: If non-zero values are supplied for ast.zero_snrlo and
#		parameter "ast.zero_snr", then the basic mask created by
#		thresholding at the SNR value specified by ast.zero_snr is
#		modified by expanding each un-masked "source" area down to
#		an SNR equal to ast.zero_snrlo, without introducing any new
#		isolated source areas. The ast.zero_snrlo should be lower
#		than the ast.zero_snr value.
ast.zero_snrlo = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	ast.zero_union
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	1
#  Purpose: 	Controls how multiple AST masks are combined.
#  Description: If more than one AST mask is specified (for instance, if
#		values are supplied for both parameter "ast.zero_lowhits"
#		and parameter "ast.zero_snr"), then they are combined
#		into a single mask. If ast.zero_union is true (i.e.
#		non-zero), then the source region in the combined mask is
#		the union of the source regions in the individual masks.
#		If ast.zero_union is false (i.e. zero), then the source
#		region in the combined mask is the intersection of the
#		source regions in the individual masks.
ast.zero_union = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	bolomap
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Creates diagnostic information.
#  Description: If non-zero, a separate map will be created from each
#		individual bolometer. These maps are placed in the BOLOMAPS
#		component of the SMURF extension in the main output map.
bolomap = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	chitol
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	<undef>
#  Purpose: 	Specifies when to stop iterating.
#  Description: If the difference in reduced chi^2 between subsequent
#		iterations falls below the value of chitol, then the map-maker
#		performs one more iteration and then terminates. Only used if
#		parameter "numiter" is negative. Parameter "maptol" provides
#		an alternative (and usually better) termination criterion.
chitol = <undef>

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	chunkweight
#  Type: 	real or string
#  Default: 	1.0
#  Purpose: 	Specifies a relative weight for each continuous chunk
#  Description: This parameter specifies the weight to use for each
#               chunk of time series data. These weights are used when
#               the maps made from the individual chunks are combined
#               together to form the total map. They can be specified in
#               two ways: 1) The "chunkweight" parameter can be set to
#               the name of a FITS header that has a numerical value. The
#               value of the FITS header for each chunk will then be used
#               as the weight for that chunk. 2) A comma-separated list
#               of explicit numerical values can be supplied. The list
#               must be enclosed in parentheses. The last value in the
#               list will be replicated if the number of values in the
#               list is smaller than the number of chunks. Thus, the
#               default value of 1.0 will cause a weight of 1.0 to be
#               used for every chunk.
chunkweight = 1.0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	com.zero_circle
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	<undef>
#  Purpose: 	Improves common-mode estimation by excluding sources
#               within a circle of given radius from the COM estimate.
#  Description: Using com.zero_circle causes any samples falling within a
#		specified circle on the map to be excluded from the
#		estimate of the mean signal at each time slice (the
#               common mode, or "COM", signal).
com.zero_circle = <undef>

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	com.zero_freeze
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Prevent the COM mask from changing after a given number
#		of iterations. This can help convergence.
#  Description: If com.zero_freeze is non-zero, the COM mask will be frozen
#		after the specified number of iterations. A value of zero
#		means that the mask is never frozen. Note, any initial
#               iterations specified by parameter "ast.skip" are not
#               included in the count of iterations.
com.zero_freeze = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	com.zero_lowhits
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Improves common-mode estimation by excluding sources
#		in regions containing many data samples.
#  Description: Using com.zero_lowhits causes samples to be excluded from
#               the estimation of the common mode if they fall in regions
#               of the map where the number of samples falling in each
#               pixel is higher than com.zero_lowhits times the mean number
#               of samples per pixel, averaged over the map. A value of
#               zero means that no masking of low hits regions is
#               performed. The mask is updated on each iteration.
com.zero_lowhits = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	com.zero_mask
#  Type: 	integer or string
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Provides a  better estimate of the common-mode ("COM")
#               signal, by excluding samples that fall within fixed
#               regions on the sky specified by an external mask.
#  Description: If com.zero_mask is set to one of "REF", "MASK2" or
#		"MASK3" then an NDF will be obtained using the specified
#		ADAM parameter (REF, MASK2 or MASK3) and used as a
#		user-defined mask. Setting com.zero_mask to an integer value
#		larger than zero has the same effect as setting it to "REF".
#		Setting it to an integer less than or equal to zero results
#		in no external mask being used with the COM model. Note,
#		using "REF" ensures that the mask and the output image of
#		MAKEMAP are on the same pixel grid - using "MASK2" or "MASK3"
#		does not provide this guarantee (it is then the users
#		responsibility to ensure that the supplied masks are aligned
# 		with the output image in pixel coordinates). The pixels in
#		the map that are to be included in the common-mode
#               estimation should be set to the bad value in the mask. All
#               other pixels will be excluded from the COM estimation.
com.zero_mask = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	com.zero_niter
#  Type: 	int
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Allows COM masking to be switched off after a given
#		number of iterations.
#  Description: If com.zero_niter is non-zero, it gives the number of
#		iterations for which the COM model should be masked.
#		Subsequent iterations are not masked. A value of zero
#		means "mask on all iterations". However, if parameter
#		"com.zero_notlast" is set, the mask will will not be applied
#		on the last iteration, even if com.zero_niter is zero.
#               Note, any initial iterations specified by parameter
#               "ast.skip" are not included in the count of iterations.
com.zero_niter = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	com.zero_notlast
#  Type: 	int
#  Default: 	1
#  Purpose: 	Prevent COM masking being performed on the last iteration.
#  Description: If com.zero_notlast is 1, then the COM model is not masked on
# 		the final iteration. This means that data samples that fall
#            	inside the masked areas are include in the estimate of
#               the common-mode signal. This should make little difference
#               since the astronomical signal should have been removed by
#               then.
com.zero_notlast = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	com.zero_snr
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0.0
#  Purpose: 	Improve the estimate of the common-mode by excluding samples
#               that correspond to high SNR pixels in the map.
#  Description: Setting the com.zero_snr parameter will exclude samples from
#               the COM estimate that fall within map pixels with SNR values
#               greater than com.zero_snr. A com.zero_snr value of zero means
#               no SNR mask is used.
#
#               Note, the SNR values are only available once a map has been
#               created, and so using this parameter results in no COM masking
#               on the first iteration. Consequently the map at the end of the
#               first iteration will have a bowl around any bright sources,
#               since no COM masking was done. Normally, these rings
#               would polute the AST model derived from the map, and thus
#               polute the residuals on the next iteration, resulting in
#               the bowls remaining in later maps. To avoid this, parameter
#               "ast.skip" can be set to a positive value. This causes the
#               AST model to be skipped (i.e. no AST signal is subtracted from
#               the residuals) for the first "ast.skip" iterations. This means
#               that a good COM mask can be formed from these initial iterations
#               before any AST model is calculated and used.
com.zero_snr = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	com.zero_snrlo
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Improve estimate of the common-mode by increasing the size
#               of the SNR mask without introducing noise.
#  Description: If non-zero values are supplied for com.zero_snrlo and
#		parameter "com.zero_snr", then the basic mask created by
#		thresholding at the SNR value specified by com.zero_snr is
#		modified by expanding each un-masked "source" area down to
#		an SNR equal to com.zero_snrlo, without introducing any new
#		isolated source areas. The com.zero_snrlo should be lower than
#		the com.zero_snr value.
com.zero_snrlo = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	com.zero_union
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	1
#  Purpose: 	Controls how multiple COM masks are combined.
#  Description: If more than one COM mask is specified (for instance, if
#		values are supplied for both parameter "com.zero_lowhits"
#		and parameter "com.zero_snr"), then they are combined
#		into a single mask. If com.zero_union is true (i.e.
#		non-zero), then the source region in the combined mask is
#		the union of the source regions in the individual masks.
#		If com.zero_union is false (i.e. zero), then the source
#		region in the combined mask is the intersection of the
#		source regions in the individual masks.
com.zero_union = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	diag.append
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Qualifies the required dignostic information.
#  Description: If non-zero, it indicates that diagnostic info should be
# 		appended to the container file specified by parameter
#		"diag.out", which should already exist. If zero, then any
#		existing container file is first deleted before storing new
#		diagnostics information in it. Only used if a value is
#		supplied for diag.out.
diag.append = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	diag.array
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	<undef>
#  Purpose: 	Qualifies the required dignostic information.
#  Description: The name of the array (S8A, S8B, etc) containing the data to
#		be written out. If <undef>, the first available array is
#		used. Only used if a value is supplied for parameter "diag.out".
diag.array = <undef>

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	diag.bolo
#  Type: 	integer or string
#  Default: 	WMEAN
#  Purpose: 	Qualifies the required dignostic information.
#  Description: Indicates the bolometer for which diagnostic information
# 		is required (the sub-array is indicated by diag.array).
#		Only used if a value is supplied for parameter "diag.out".
#		It can be:
#
#    		- A pair of integers, separated by a comma, contained in
#    		parentheses, giving the column and row of the bolometer. The
#    		first integer should be in the range 0 to 31, and the second
#    		should be in the range 0 to 39.
#
#    		- A single integer in the range 0 to 1279.
#
#    		- The string "MEAN" (case insensitive), in which case all
#    		unflagged data from all good bolometers is averaged to form
#    		the time-stream to dump.
#
#    		- The string "WMEAN" (case insensitive), in which case all
#    		unflagged data from all good bolometers is averaged using
#    		weights derived from the bolometer noise estimates to form
#    		the time-stream to dump.
#
#    		- The string "TYPICAL" (case insensitive), in which case a
#    		bolometer with typical noise charactersitics is chosen and
#    		used. The index of the chosen bolometer is reported, and
#    		stored in the dumped NDFs.
diag.bolo = WMEAN

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	diag.cube
#  Type: 	int
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Qualifies the required dignostic information.
#  Description: If non-zero, create 3D cubes containing the required
#               residuals or models for all bolometers at each iteration.
#               Warning - this can be a huge amount of data so only use
#               on very short time series (e.g. a single subscan) and for
#		very few iterations. The cubes have names of the form
#		"<where>_<chunk>_cube_<iter>", (see parameter "diag.out").
#		Only used if a value is supplied for diag.out.

#  Purpose: 	Speeds up map-making, and reduces memory requirements.
#  Description: If the telescope is scanning slowly the data may be
#		safely down-sampled to save memory and time. This parameter
#		controls the minimum angular scale on the sky. The new
#		sample frequency is chosen such that this scale will be
#		preserved taking into account the average slew speed and
# 		the sample rate of the input files. If a positive value is
#		selected, this gives the angular scale (in arcsec) to which
#		the new sample rate will be matched. Alternatively, if a
#		negative value is supplied, its magnitude will be multiplied
#		by the PIXSIZE for the requested map. For example, the default
#		here is to set it to -1 such that the time-series sample rate
#		matches the pixel grid (in practice, a factor of 2 might make
#		more sense as this would correspond to the Nyquist frequency

#		implied if NOI is specified as it becomes the variance
#		component of the resulting NDF for RES. QUA will become the

#		RES, AST, FLT, EXT), but no quality will be written to model
#		components with different dimensions.

#  Purpose: 	Diagnostic tool for checking delays in bolometer time
#		streams.
#  Description: A delay, in seconds, to apply to each fake time stream
#		sampled from the supplied fake map, prior to adding it to

#  Name: 	fakemap
#  Type: 	string
#  Default: 	<undef>
#  Purpose: 	Diagnostic tool to explore the effects of the map-making

#		to provide an image of the sky that will produce additional
# 		astronomical signal to the time series. At present, the
#		dimensions of this map must be identical to that of the real

#		makemap; (ii) produce an image with simulated data with the
#		same pixel dimensions; (iii) specify this new map for the
#		"fakemap" parameter below. Note that this is a fully-parsed
#		ndf identifier, so you can do things like:

#  Purpose: 	Diagnostic tool for checking effects of MCE filter.
#  Description: If non-zero, the time-series data generated from the fakemap
#		is smoothed using the MCE response. See parameter "fakemap".
#		This should normally be set non-zero if parameter "deconvmce"
#		is set non-zero, so that the fakemap signal is left

#  Name: 	flagmap
#  Type: 	list of strings
#  Default: 	<undef>
#  Purpose: 	Dump diagnostic info about the time series qualities
#  Description: If set to a comma-separated list of quality names, enclosed
#		in parentheses, then an extension called .MORE.SMURF.FLAGMAPS
#		will be created in the output map NDF. This will contain
#		a set of "flagmaps", one for each continuous chunk of
#		time-series data, each containing a count of the number
#		of samples with a quality bit matching at least one of the
#		specified flags. The following quality names can be used:
#
# 		- BADDA   : flagged bad by the DA system
#
# 		- BADBOL : entire bolometer is turned off
#
# 		- SPIKE   : flagged as a spike
#
# 		- DCJUMP  : location of a DC level step
#
# 		- STAT    : telescope was not moving within flagslow to flagfast
#
# 		- COM     : portion of data did not match the common-mode
#
# 		- FILT    : filtered data did not have sufficient contributions from good data
#
# 		- NOISE   : bolometer was flagged as being too noisy in general
#
#		Note: If BADBOL is set the behaviour is slightly different than
#		expected; the bolometer will be completely ignored when
#		creating the flag map.
#
# 		The flagmap is mostly useful to verify whether the spike,
#		jump, and common-mode rejection is correlated with features
#		in the map (e.g. bright sources), for all of the detectors
#		that were used to produce the map,
#		e.g. flagmap = (BADBOL,SPIKE,DCJUMP,COM).

#		stream prior to taking the FFT. If <undef>, a default
#		value is used equal to 1/(steptime*freq) where freq is

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.filt_edge_largescale
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	600 (for 450 um), 300 (for 850 um)
#  Purpose: 	Specifies the largest scale size to be retained by the
#		FLT model.
#  Description: Together with parameter "flt.filt_edge_smallscale", this
#		specifies the frequencies which the FLT model is to remove
#		from the data streams, based on a range of requested spatial
#		scales (in arcsec), and using internal measurements of
# 		the average slew speed. These will override parameter
#		"flt.filt_edgehigh" and parameter "flt.filt_edgelow". For
#		example, suppose the slew speed is 100 arcsec/sec. We want to
#		ensure that the beam is fully sampled, say 2 arcsec at 450um.
#		That scale is crossed in 2/100 = 0.02 s, so we don't need
#		frequencies in the data above 1/0.02 = 50 Hz in this case
#		(i.e. internally it will set flt.filt_edgelow to 50Hz if
#		flt.filt_edge_smallscale is set to 2 arcsec). Similarly, if
#		we would like to attempt to preserve scales of 10 arcmin =
#		600 arcsec, we would want to keep frequencies that are
#		greater than 1/(600/100.) = 0.17 Hz (i.e. setting
# 		flt.filt_edge_largescale=600 would translate into

#  Purpose: 	Indicates if the edge filter is hard or soft edged.
#  Description: If flt.filt_edgewidth is zero, then the edge filters defined

#		is, they change from zero to one without any intermediate
#		values. If flt.filt_edgewidth is larger than zero, the edge

#  Description: If supplied, this will switch on an experimental method for
#		handling missing or flagged data when filtering the time
#		streams, based on replacing missing data with zero, and
#		then normalising the smoothed data using a mask of good
#		samples smoothed in the same way. The flt.filt_wlim value
#		specifies the minimum fraction of good values that must
#		contribute to a filtered value. For instance, if wlim is
#		0.9 then a filtered data value is flagged as bad unless at
#	   	least 0.9 of the input values that contribute to it are good
#		(i.e. have not been flagged as unusable for any reason). Thus
#		a high filt_wlim value (i.e. close to 1.0) will cause more
#	  	data to be rejected, and a low value (i.e. close to 0.0) will
#	 	cause less data to be rejected. A value of <undef> causes the
#		old filtering algorithm to be used that is based on filling
#		gaps with artificial data. If the experimental algorithm is

#  Name: 	flt.undofirst
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	1
#  Purpose: 	Improves convergence.
#  Description: If non-zero, add the old FLT model back into the
#		residuals at the start of the iteration (and so before COM)
#		rather than just before estimating a new FLT Model.
flt.undofirst = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.whiten
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Experimental.
#  Description: If non-zero, then a whitening filter will be applied to
#		each time stream prior to apply the other FLT filters.
flt.whiten = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.whiten_last
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	<undef>
#  Purpose: 	Experimental.
#  Description: This is the value to be used for parameter "flt.whiten"
#               on the last iteration. If it is "<undef>", then the same value
#               will be used as for earlier iterations.
flt.whiten_last = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.zero_circle
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	<undef>
#  Purpose: 	Speeds up convergences and reduces ringing by excluding
#		sources within a circle of given radius from the FLT estimate.
#  Description: Using flt.zero_circle causes any samples falling within a
#		specified circle on the map to be excluded from the
#		filtering performed by the FLT model.
flt.zero_circle = <undef>

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.zero_freeze
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Prevent the FLT mask from changing after a given number
#		of iterations. This can help convergence.
#  Description: If flt.zero_freeze is non-zero, the FLT mask will be frozen
#		after the specified number of iterations. A value of zero
#		means that the mask is never frozen. Note, any initial
#               iterations specified by parameter "ast.skip" are not
#               included in the count of iterations.
flt.zero_freeze = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.zero_lowhits
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Experimental.
#  Description: Using flt.zero_lowhits causes samples to be excluded from
#               the filtering performed by the FLT model if they fall in
#               regions of the map where the number of samples falling in each
#               pixel is higher than flt.zero_lowhits times the mean number
#               of samples per pixel, averaged over the map. A value of
#               zero means that no masking of low hits regions is
#               performed. The mask is updated on each iteration.
flt.zero_lowhits = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.zero_mask
#  Type: 	integer or string
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Speeds up convergences and reduces ringing by excluding
#		sources within a region specified by an external mask file
#		from the filtering performed by the FLT model.
#  Description: If flt.zero_mask is set to one of "REF", "MASK2" or
#		"MASK3" then an NDF will be obtained using the specified
#		ADAM parameter (REF, MASK2 or MASK3) and used as a
#		user-defined mask. Setting flt.zero_mask to an integer value
#		larger than zero has the same effect as setting it to "REF".
#		Setting it to an integer less than or equal to zero results
#		in no external mask being used with the COM model. Note,
#		using "REF" ensures that the mask and the output image of
#		MAKEMAP are on the same pixel grid - using "MASK2" or "MASK3"
#		does not provide this guarantee (it is then the users
#		responsibility to ensure that the supplied masks are aligned
# 		with the output image in pixel coordinates). The pixels in
#		the map that are to be included in filtering performed by
#               the FLT model should be set to the bad value in the mask. All
#               other pixels will be excluded from the filtering (i.e.
#		they will be replaced by artifical data interpolated from the
#		adjacent data).
flt.zero_mask = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.zero_niter
#  Type: 	int
#  Default: 	2
#  Purpose: 	Allows FLT masking to be switched off after a given
#		number of iterations.
#  Description: If flt.zero_niter is non-zero, it gives the number of
#		iterations for which the FLT model should be masked.
#		Subsequent iterations are not masked. A value of zero
#		means "mask on all iterations". However, if parameter
#		"flt.zero_notlast" is set, the mask will will not be applied
#		on the last iteration, even if flt.zero_niter is zero.
#		Note, using FLT masking on many iterations can inhibit
#		convergence. Also, any initial iterations specified by
#               parameter "ast.skip" are not included in the count of
#               iterations.
flt.zero_niter = 2

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.zero_notlast
#  Type: 	int
#  Default: 	1
#  Purpose: 	Prevent FLT masking being performed on the last iteration.
#  Description: If flt.zero_notlast is 1, then the FLT model is not masked on
# 		the final iteration.
flt.zero_notlast = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.zero_snr
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0.0
#  Purpose: 	Speeds up convergences and reduces ringing by excluding samples
#               that correspond to high SNR pixels in the map.
#  Description: Setting the flt.zero_snr parameter will prevent samples
#		contributing to the FLT model if they fall within map pixels
#		that have SNR values greater than flt.zero_snr. A flt.zero_snr
#		value of zero means no SNR mask is used.
#
#               Note, the SNR values are only available once a map has been
#               created, and so using this parameter results in no FLT masking
#               on the first iteration. Consequently the map at the end of the
#               first iteration will have deep rings around bright sources,
#               since no FLT masking was done. Normally, these rings
#               would polute the AST model derived from the map, and thus
#               polute the residuals on the next iteration, resulting in
#               the rings remaining in later maps. To avoid this, parameter
#               "ast.skip" can be set to a positive value. This causes the
#               AST model to be skipped (i.e. no AST signal is subtracted from
#               the residuals) for the first "ast.skip" iterations. This means
#               that a good FLT mask can be formed from these initial iterations
#               before any AST model is calculated and used.
flt.zero_snr = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.zero_snrlo
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Speeds up convergences and reduces ringing by increasing the
#               size of the SNR mask without introducing noise.
#  Description: If non-zero values are supplied for flt.zero_snrlo and
#		parameter "flt.zero_snr", then the basic mask created by
#		thresholding at the SNR value specified by flt.zero_snr is
#		modified by expanding each un-masked "source" area down to
#		an SNR equal to flt.zero_snrlo, without introducing any new
#		isolated source areas. The flt.zero_snrlo should be lower than
#		the flt.zero_snr value.
flt.zero_snrlo = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.zero_union
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	1
#  Purpose: 	Controls how multiple FLT masks are combined.
#  Description: If more than one FLT mask is specified (for instance, if
#		values are supplied for both parameter "flt.zero_lowhits"
#		and parameter "flt.zero_snr"), then they are combined
#		into a single mask. If flt.zero_union is true (i.e.
#		non-zero), then the source region in the combined mask is
#		the union of the source regions in the individual masks.
#		If flt.zero_union is false (i.e. zero), then the source
#		region in the combined mask is the intersection of the
#		source regions in the individual masks.
flt.zero_union = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.zeropad
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Avoid unnecessary loss of data due to apodisation.
#  Description: If flt.zeropad is non-zero, the extra samples used to pad
#		each end of the data streams are set to 0 prior to
#		filtering within the FLT model, and apodization is used to
#		slowly roll-off the ends of the time series to 0 (see
#		parameter "flt.apod"). If flt.zeropad is zero, a cubic
#		polynomial is used to interpolate smoothly between the end
#		of the time series and the beginning of the time series,
#		ensuring continuity in both the value and first derivative.
#		In both cases, the purpose is to remove sharp edges that may
#		cause ringing in the FFT filtering steps.
flt.zeropad = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	flt.zeropad_last
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	<undef>
#  Purpose: 	Avoid unnecessary loss of data due to apodisation on the
#               last iteration.
#  Description: This is the value to be used for parameter "flt.zeropad"
#               on the last iteration. If it is "<undef>", then the same value
#               will be used as for earlier iterations.
flt.zeropad_last = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	importsky
#  Type: 	integer or string
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Allow a map created by a previous run of makemap to be
#		used as the inital estimate of the sky.
#  Description: If importsky is set to one of "REF", "MASK2" or "MASK3" then
#		an NDF will be obtained using the specified ADAM parameter
#		(REF, MASK2 or MASK3) and used as the initial estimate of
#		the sky. The image value at the position of each bolometer
#		sample will be found and subtracted from the bolometer value
#		immediately before the start of the first iteration. In
#		addition, the supplied image will be added back onto the map
#		esimated at the end of the first iteration, before using the
#		map to determine the AST model. Setting importsky to an integer
#		value larger than zero has the same effect as setting it to
#		"REF". Setting it to an integer less than or equal to zero
#		results in no inital sky being removed. Note, using "REF"
#		ensures that the mask and the output image of MAKEMAP are on
#		the same pixel grid - using "MASK2" or "MASK3" does not provide
#		this guarantee (it is then the users responsibility to ensure
#		that the supplied maps are aligned with the output map in pixel
#		coordinates).
importsky = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	itermap
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Provide extra diagnostic information.
#  Description: If itermap is set to a positive value, the map from each iteration
#               of each chunk will be stored in an output NDF. If itermap is set
#               to a negative value, only the final iteration will be written from
#               each chunk. If its absolute value is larger than 1, then each
#               itermap will include a quality component that reflects the AST
#               mask in use.
#
#               By default, each itermap NDF will be stored in an extension
#		called .MORE.SMURF.ITERMAPS in the main output NDF. However,
#               an alternative location can be specified by supplying a value
#               for ADAM parameter ITERMAPS. This is useful as it allows you
#               to look at earlier itermaps whilst makemap is still running.
itermap = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	maptol
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0.05
#  Purpose: 	Specifies when to stop iterating.
#  Description: If the normalised mean change between the maps created on
#		subsequent iterations falls below the value of maptol, then the
#		map-maker performs one more iteration and then terminates. Only
#		used if parameter "numiter" is negative. The normalised mean
#		change between maps is defined as the mean of the absolute
#		change in map pixel value, averaged over all pixels within the
#		region of the AST mask (if any, see parameter "ast.zero_mask",
#		etc), and normalised by the RMS of the square root of the
#		pixel variances. Compared to parameter "chitol", this is much
#		more like a "by eye" test, that will stop the solution when
#		the map stops changing.
maptol = 0.05

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	maxlen
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Determines how the input time-series data is split into chunks
#  Description: The maximum length (in seconds) for a single chunk of
#		concatenated data. If 0 is supplied, attempt to concatenate
#		entire continuous chunks.
maxlen = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	modelorder
#  Type: 	list of strings
#  Default: 	(com,gai,ext,flt,ast,noi)
#  Purpose: 	Determines which models to include in the iterative
#		process, and the order in which they are evaluated.
#  Description: This should be a comma-separated list, in parentheses,
#		containing one or more of the following model names, in the
#		order in which they should be evaluated. Note: components
#		specified AFTER 'ast' will not be calculated for the first
#		time until the second iteration:
#
#  		- dks: fit and remove dark squid for the column
#
#		- com: remove common-mode signal
#
#		- gai: if com specified, fit gain/offset of common mode
#
#		- ext: apply extinction correction
#
#		- ast: estimate the map and astronomical signal
#
#		- flt: apply filter to time streams
#
#		- noi: estimate time-domain variance
#
#		- smo: time series smoothing using a median or mean boxcar filter
#
#		- pln: remove plane from each time slice
#
#		- tmp: remove externally define template such as azimuth
modelorder = (com,gai,ext,flt,ast,noi)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noexportsetbad
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Controls contents of diagnostic maps
#  Description: Normally all data points in exported model components (see
#		parameter "exportndf") are set to the Starlink "bad" value
#		wherever there is a bad bolometer established during map-making.
#		Set this flag to a non-zero value to prevent this behaviour.
noexportsetbad = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.box_size
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Allow finer estimation of the noise levels in the time-series
#		data.
#  Description: Specifies the number of time slices used to determine the
#		noise level in a section of a bolometer time stream. If zero,
#		then the whole bolometer time stream is used, and each
#		bolometer has only one variance value. If non-zero, each
#		bolometer time stream is divided up into boxes containing the
#	  	specified number of time slices, and a separate variance
#  		is found for each box. This variance is then used for each
#		sample in the box, so each bolometer ends up with a variance
#		for every time slice. Negative values are interpreted as number
#		of seconds, and positive values as a number of down-sampled
#		time slices. Note, very small box sizes may produce
#		unrepresentative noise levels, and there is a hard minimum
#		of 101 on the number of downsampled time slices in a noise box.
noi.box_size = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.calcfirst
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Determines when the noise in each bolometer is estimated.
#  Description: If a non-zero value is supplied, the bolometer noise levels are
#		calculated immediately after pre-conditioning. Otherwise, they
#		calculated at the end of the first iteration. The former can
# 		reduce execution time if parameter "noiseclip" is also set
#		since both operations share a single FFT.
noi.calcfirst = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.dcfitbox
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Controls the detection and correction of steps within the
#		NOI model.
#  Description: This gives the box size over which to fit data with a
#		straight line on either side of a potential DC jump,
#		prior to estimating the bolometer noise levels in the NOI
#		model. If positive, in units of samples. If negative, in
# 		units of seconds. If zero, do not perform step correction
#		during estimation of the NOI model.
noi.dcfitbox = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.dclimcorr
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	10
#  Purpose: 	Controls the detection and correction of steps within the
#               NOI model.
#  Description: If more than DCLIMCORR bolometer have a step at a given
#		time, then all bolometers are corrected for a step at that
#		time, using lower thresholds. A value of zero switches off
#		the correction of correlated steps within the NOI model.
#		Only used if parameter "noi.dcfitbox" is non-zero.
noi.dclimcorr = 10

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.dcmaxsteps
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	10
#  Purpose: 	Controls the detection and correction of steps within the
#               NOI model.
#  Description: The maximum number of steps that can be corrected in each
#		minute of good data (i.e. per 12000 samples) from a bolometer
#		before the entire bolometer is flagged as bad. A value of zero
#		will cause a bolometer to be rejected if any steps are found in
#		the bolometer data stream. Only used if parameter "noi.dcfitbox"
#		is non-zero.
noi.dcmaxsteps = 10

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.dcsmooth
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	50
#  Purpose: 	Controls the detection and correction of steps within the
#               NOI model.
#  Description: The width of the median filter used to smooth a bolometer
#		data stream prior to finding DC jumps. If positive, in units
#		of samples. If negative, in units of seconds. Only used if
#		parameter "noi.dcfitbox" is non-zero.
noi.dcsmooth = 50

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.dcthresh
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	25.0
#  Purpose: 	Controls the detection and correction of steps within the
#               NOI model.
#  Description: The SNR threshold at which to detect DC steps. Note, this
#		refers to the noise level in the bolometer data after it has
#		been smoothed with a median filter of width given by
#		parameter "noi.dcsmooth". In order to find the equivalent
#		threshold in the unsmoothed data, multiply the noi.dcthresh
#		value by 1.25/sqrt(noi.dcsmooth). For instance, the default
#		values for noi.dcsmooth (50) and noi.dcthresh (25) correspond
#		to a threshold of 25*1.25/sqrt(50) = 4.4 sigma in the
#		unsmoothed data.
noi.dcthresh = 25.0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.export
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Controls the exporting of the NOI model.
#  Description: If set to a non-zero value, export the values in the NOI
#               model to an NDF. The name of the NDF is similar to that
#               used by parameter "exportndf", but with a trailing
#               suffix of "_noi" instead of "_res". Unlike "exportndf",
#               the NOI values are stored in the "Data" array of the NDF,
#               and only one value is stored for each box in the NOI model
#               (see parameter "noi.box_size"). This makes the NDF much
#               smaller than that produced by "exportndf". The box size
#               (in samples) is stored in the NOI_BOXSIZE item in the
#               SMURF extension of the NDF.
noi.export = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.fillgaps
#  Type: 	integer

#  Purpose: 	Controls handling of missing data within NOI FFT code
#  Description: If non-zero, fill vicinity of spikes / DC steps with
#		constrained realization of noise.
noi.fillgaps = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.import
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Controls the noise values used in the NOI model.
#  Description: If set to a non-zero value, import the noise values to use
#               in the NOI model from an NDF created by a previous run of
#               makemap, rather than calculating them from scratch. The
#               NDF should have been created by setting parameter "noi.export"
#               to 1 in the configuration for a previous run of makemap.
#               (the file should end in "_noi.sdf"). Note, the parameter
#               "noi.box_size" must be set to the same value it had in the
#               previous run of makemap.
noi.import = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.spikebox
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	50
#  Purpose: 	Controls time-based spike detection within NOI model.
#  Description: Size of filter box for the sigma-clipper within the NOI model,
#		in units of samples if positive and seconds if negative.
#		For instance, setting noi.spikebox to 50 will check for
#		excursions from a rolling median filter in a box of length
#		50 samples. Also see parameter "noi.spikethresh".
noi.spikebox = 50

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	noi.spikethresh
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Controls time-based spike detection within NOI model.
#  Description: The SNR value at which to flag spikes within the

#		model if a value of zero is supplied.
noi.spikethresh = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	numiter
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	-5
#  Purpose: 	Determines when to stop iterating.
#  Description: If a positive number is supplied, the specified number of
#		iterations will always be performed. If a negative number is
#		supplied, the absolute value gives the maximum number of
#		iterations to perform. Fewer iterations will be performed if
#		the termination criteria specified by parameter "maptol" and
#		parameter "chitol" are both met before "-numiter"
#		iterations have been performed.
numiter = -5

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	pad
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	<undef>
#  Purpose: 	Specifies the length of padding to add to the start and
#		end of each time series.
#  Description: Specifies the length, in down-sampled time slices, of the
#		padding to add the the start and end of each time series to
#		prevent wrap-around effects between the start and end of
#		the data streams when taking the FFT. If <undef>, a
#		default value is used which is determined from the

#		"zeropad".
pad = <undef>

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	pln.notfirst
#  Type: 	integer

#		iteration.
pln.notfirst = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	sampcube
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Provides extra diagnostic information.

#		samples that go into each map pixel.
sampcube = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	shortmap
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Provides extra diagnostic information.
#  Description: If non-zero, then an extension called .MORE.SMURF.SHORTMAPS
#               is added to the output map NDF, holding maps made from every
#		group of "shortmap" adjacent time slices. Alternatively, set
#		to -1 to produce a map each time the TCS_INDEX value within
#		the JCMTSTATE extension is incremented (i.e., each time a full
#		pass through the scan pattern has been completed). Any other
#		negative value is interpreted as a duration in seconds, and is
#		converted to time slices using the (possibly down-sampled)
#		sample frequency of the data being mapped.
shortmap = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	smo.boxcar
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	-10 (for 450 um), -3 (for 850 um)
#  Purpose: 	Controls the SMO model.
#  Description: The width of the smoothing box used by the SMO model. This is
#		roughly equivalent to FLT with a high-pass filter at cutoff
#		frequencies 0.1 and 0.3 Hz for 450 and 850 respectively). If

#  Name: 	smo.notfirst
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	1
#  Purpose: 	Controls the SMO model.
#  Description: If non-zero, skip the SMO model on the first iteration.
smo.notfirst = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	smo.type
#  Type: 	string
#  Default: 	median
#  Purpose: 	Controls the SMO model.
#  Description: The type of filter used by the SMO model: median or mean.
smo.type = median

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	tmp.docos
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Controls the TMP model.
#  Description: Indicates that the cosine of the template should be
#		taken before fitting the TMP model. It is assumed that
#		the template quantities are in radians.
tmp.docos = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	tmp.dosin
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Controls the TMP model.
#  Description: Indicates that the sine of the template should be
#		taken before fitting the TMP model. It is assumed that
#		the template quantities are in radians.
tmp.dosin = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	tmp.source
#  Type: 	string
#  Default: 	<undef>
#  Purpose: 	Controls the TMP model.
#  Description: The TMP model fits an externally defined template to each
#		bolometer time-series. The tmp.source parameter defines
#		what that template is. Presently the only two valid options
#		are "state_az" and "state_el" to use the telescope azimuth
#		and elevation respectively. The former seems to be a good
#		way for removing magnetic field pickup.
tmp.source = <undef>

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	tmp.trigoffset
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	0
#  Purpose: 	Controls the TMP model.
#  Description: Indicates an offset that is to be added to the TMP model
#		template.
tmp.trigoffset = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	tstep
#  Type: 	real
#  Default: 	-0.5
#  Purpose: 	Determines the accuracy of each sample location within
#		the map.
#  Description: The gap (in time slices if positive and seconds if
#		negative) between full calculations of the output map
#		bolometer positions. Setting a larger value for this will
#		speed up the map maker but will introduce larger spatial
# 		errors. The default value of -0.5 (i.e. 100 samples at a
#		sample rate of 200 Hz) seems to produce spatial errors of
#		under 0.1 arc-sec. This level of errors seems to cause about
#		1% of bolometers samples to be pushed into a neighouring map
#		pixel. For tstep=100, the calculation of bolometer positions
#		speeds up by about a factor of 60. Setting tstep to 1 (or
#		zero) causes all bolometer positions to be calculated in full,
# 		without any approximation.
tstep = -0.5

#  Purpose: 	Controls the TWO model.
#  Description: The "B" map to be used in the TWO model
two.bmap = <undef>

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#  Name: 	varmapmethod
#  Type: 	integer
#  Default: 	1
#  Purpose: 	Controls how the map variance values are found.
#  Description: If zero, propagate variances from the time-domain noise
#		esimates (requires the NOI model component to be present in
#		parameter "modelorder"). Otherwise, use the sample variance
#		of the data values that land in each pixel.
varmapmethod = 1
