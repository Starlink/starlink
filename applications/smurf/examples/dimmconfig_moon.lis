# *** Specialized config for the moon ***
#
# This config file is for the fairly specialized case of scans across
# the moon (tuned using 850um observations 20110328 #40). Astronomical
# signal dominates everything else, so we place map estimation
# *before* the removal of low-frequency noise (see modelorder). In
# addition, we set the filter scale to 2000 arcsec, slightly beyond the
# disk.  Common-mode removal is completely turned off.  Noise in the
# WVM signal can cause significant steps, so we instead use CSOTAU as
# a fixed zenith opacity monitor (which internally gets converted into
# line-of-sight values smoothly with elevation). Finally, we use a
# zero-constraint to provide a solid baseline beyond the edge of the
# moon as a reference, and to help the solution converge.

# structure on the scale of the array.
modelorder = (ext,ast,flt,noi)

# gradients

# the above filters will do a good job on large-scale structure, but
# there will be striping due to residual low-frequency noise, and
# errors in the flatfield. Re-run with a much harsher filter to reduce
# these effects, at the expense of having much more poorly constrained
# larger-scale structures:
#450.flt.filt_edge_largescale=200
#850.flt.filt_edge_largescale=200

# use CSOTau instead of WVM because it gives a smoother extinction correction
# function with time
