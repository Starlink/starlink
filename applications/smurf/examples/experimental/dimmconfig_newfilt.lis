# *** Specialized config that uses the new filtering algorithm
#
# The original filtering algorithm handled missing or rejected data
# by filling the gaps in the data stream with artifical data that was
# linear with time, and included gaussian noise at a typical level. This
# is a potentially fragile approach which relies on the artifical data
# being a reasonable representation of the real data. The random noise
# added to the artifical data also introduces a random element into the
# data values in the final map.
#
# This configuration file uses an alternative approach, which excludes
# the missing data completely from the filtered data. It does this by
# filling the gaps in the data stream with the value zero prior to
# filtering the data. In addition, it creates a mask that has value 1.0
# at each used data sample and 0.0 at each unused data sample, and
# filters this mask in the same way as the data stream. The filtered data
# stream is then normalised by dividing it by the filtered mask.
#
# The new algorithm is roughly a factor of two slower than the old
# algorithm, due to two FFTs being needed per bolometer instead of one.

# "filt_wlim" specifies the minimum fraction of good values that must
# contribute to a filtered value. For instance, if wlim is 0.9 then a
# filtered data value is flagged as bad unless at least 0.9 of the input
# values that contribute to it are good (i.e. have not been flagged as
# unusable for any reason). Thus a high filt_wlim value (i.e. close to
# 1.0) will cause more data to be rejected, and a low value (i.e. close to
# 0.0) will cause less data to be rejected. A value of <undef> causes the
# old filtering algorithm to be used that is based on filling gaps with
# artificial data.
