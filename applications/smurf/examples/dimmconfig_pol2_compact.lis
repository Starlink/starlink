#  Name:
#     dimmconfig_pol2_compact.lis

#  Purpose:
#     A MAKEMAP configuration for POL2 data suitable for compact sources .

#  Description:
#     This file provides values for parameters used by the SMURF:MAKEMAP
#     command to control the details of the map-making algorithm when
#     making maps from POL2 "scan & spin" data. To use it, assign it to
#     the CONFIG parameter on the command line when running MAKEMAP. For
#     instance:
#
#     % makemap config=^/star/share/smurf/dimmconfig_pol2_compact.lis
#
#     (substitute the path to your Starlink installation in place of
#     "/star").
#
#     The strategy provided by this configuration is aimed at isolated
#     compact sources. We constrain the map using ast.zero_circle=(0.01666),
#     which sets all pixels beyond 60 arcsec to zero until the last iteration.

#  Notes:
#     - This file inherits the parameter values defined in hidden file
#     /star/share/smurf/.dimmconfig_pol2.lis (note the dot at the start
#     of the file name).
#     - For a full list of all available parameters, and their purposes,
#     see the file $SMURF_DIR/smurf_makemap.def. All available parameters
#     are also documented in SUN/258, appendix "Configuration Parameters".
#     - A single parameter can be given different values to use when
#     processing 450 or 850 um data. This is done by including the
#     parameter twice, prefixing the parameter name with "450." and "850."
