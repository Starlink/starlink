#  Name:
#      smurf_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against SMURF.

#  Language:
#     Bourne Shell

#  Type of Module:
#     Bourne-shell script.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a makefile command to
#     create a monolith in Starlink standard makefiles, thus:
#
#         $(ALINK) $(MONO_OBJECT) -o $(MONOLITH) `surf_libs` \
#             -L$(STAR_LIB) `./surf_link_adam`

#  Description:
#     This script lists the linking qualifiers for the non-SMURF
#     libraries used by SMURF.  It should be invoked by those building
#     SMURF or other applications which use SMURF libraries in order to
#     generate the correct arguments for the compiler (or ld) command.
#     The arguments generated are written to the standard output.
#
#     The script contains an awk script to remove duplicate references
#     that result from other linker `options' files.  The file is
#     needed because there would be too many references before the awk
#     script could reduce them.

#  History:
#     1992 June 3 (MJC):
#        Original version.
#     1995 August 19 (MJC)
#        Merged with the RFWS-BLY template app_link_adam.  Incorporated
#        the libraries listed in kappa_graphics and kappa_rest scripts.
#     1995 October 26 (MJC)
#        Added PDA and ARD.
#     1997 June 12 (TIMJ)
#        Convert from KAPPA to SURF
#     1997 October (TIMJ)
#        Add the PGPLOT librarry.
#     1998 April 20 (TIMJ)
#         Add GRP
#     1999 July 2 (TIMJ)
#        Remove IRAS90 dependency
#     2000 June 2 (TIMJ)
#         Remove SGS dependency.
#     2000 August 21 (TIMJ)
#        Add NDG
#     2000 October 27 (TIMJ)
#        Remove /star/lib since that makes it impossible to build
#        on stardev system.
#     2004 July 14 (TIMJ)
#        Stop using SGS/GKS
#     2004 July 27 (TIMJ)
#        Use SHL
#     2005 Sep 27 (TIMJ):
#        Copy from surf_link_adam for SMURF usage
#     2005 Nov 30 (TIMJ):
#        Add KAPLIBS
#     2006 Sep 13 (JB)
#        Add ard_link
#     2006 Oct 9 (TIMJ):
#        Should be ard_link_adam
#     2008 June 3 (EC):
#        Add fftw3
#     2009 April 23 (EC)
#        Link against multi-threaded fftw3 library
#     2012-03-06 (TIMJ):
#        Add sofa and pal
