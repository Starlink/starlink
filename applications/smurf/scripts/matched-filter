#  Name:
#    matched-filter

#  Purpose:
#    Applies a matched filter to the supplied input NDF by smoothing it
#    using either a supplied PSF image or an automatically generated
#    Gaussian PSF. Each output pixel value is given by:
#
#                      sum( (psf_i/input_variance_i)*input_data_i )
#      output_data  =  --------------------------------------------
#                           sum( psf_i**2/input_variance_i )
#
#    where the sum is over all input pixels that contribute to the output
#    pixel. The variances stored with the resulting image are given by:
#
#                                      1.0
#      output_variance = --------------------------------
#                        sum( psf_i**2/input_variance_i )

#  Invocation:
#    matched-filter [-np] [-s fwhm] [-f fits] [-h] [--help] <in> <out>  [<psf>]

#  Options:
#    -np  - If the script creates a new PSF (i.e. if the <psf> parameter is
#           not supplied on the command line), then normalise the new PSF to
#           a peak value of unity. Without this option, the new PSF is
#           normalised to a total data sum of unity.
#    -s   - If the script creates a new PSF (i.e. if the <psf> parameter is
#           not supplied on the command line), then a slowly varying background
#           is estimated and removed from the supplied image before the filter
#           is applied. The background to remove is created by smoothing the
#           image with a wide Gaussian. The FWHM of this Gaussian should be
#           specified (in arc-seconds) on the command line after the "-s"
#           option. In order to compensate for this, the PSF is also
#           processed in the same way (i.e. it is smoothed using the wide
#           Gaussian and the smoothed PSF is then removed from the original
#           PSF).
#    -f   - Specifies an NDF from which the required FITS headers should be
#           read. If this option is not specified, the FITS headers are read
#           from the NDF specified by <in>.
#    -h   - Display this prologue and exit.
#  --help - Display this prologue and exit.

#  Parameters:
#    <in> - The input image.
#    <out> - The output image.
#    <psf> - An optional PSF image.

#  Notes:
#    - If no PSF is supplied, a Gaussian PSF is used with FWHM
#      equal to the Airy disk radius.
#    - The centre of the supplied PSF is assumed to be at pixel (0,0).
#    - The PSF must not contain any bad values.
#    - The input must contain a variance component.
#    - The input and PSF must contain floating point values.

#  History:
#    2010-1-05 (DSB):
#       Initial revision
#    2010-4-13 (DSB):
#       - Correct the expression used for calculating the output variances.
#       - By default, normalise the PSF to a total data sum of unity, and
#         provide the "-np" option to retain the old behaviour (normalising
#         to a peak value of unity).
#       - Added the "-s" option.
#    2010-4-14 (DSB):
#       - Changed to use Ed's way of removing background variations.
#    2010-5-26 (DSB):
#       - Avoid truncating the smoothed PSF when using the "-s" option.
#       - Improve trapping of errors due to missing FITS headers
#       - Account for bad pixels when correcting for the total data sum
#         in the psf (by setting the new CONVOLVE parameter "NORM" to FALSE).
#    2010-5-27 (DSB):
#       - When creating a PSF that will later be smoothed to remove backgrounds,
#         create the PSF with the required final size, rather than creating it
#         small and then padding it with zeros.
#    2010-6-7 (DSB):
#       - Copy the input NDF data units to the output NDF.
#    2011-8-31 (DSB):
#       - Added the -f, -h and --help options.
#       - Allow the input NDF to be stored as a component in a container file.
