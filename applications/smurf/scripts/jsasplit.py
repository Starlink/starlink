*  Name:
*     JSASPLIT

*  Purpose:
*     Split a single NDF up into a set of JSA tiles.

*  Language:
*     python (2.7 or 3.*)

*  Description:
*     This script re-projects a supplied NDF onto the JSA all-sky pixel
*     grid and then splits the resulting NDF into more JSA tiles.

*  Usage:
*     jsasplit in out [trim] [retain] [msg_filter] [ilevel] [glevel] [logfile]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     GLEVEL = LITERAL (Read)
*        Controls the level of information to write to a text log file.
*        Allowed values are as for "ILEVEL". The log file to create is
*        specified via parameter "LOGFILE". ["ATASK"]
*     ILEVEL = LITERAL (Read)
*        Controls the level of information displayed on the screen by the
*        script. It can take any of the following values (note, these values
*        are purposefully different to the SUN/104 values to avoid confusion
*        in their effects):
*
*        - "NONE": No screen output is created
*
*        - "CRITICAL": Only critical messages are displayed such as warnings.
*
*        - "PROGRESS": Extra messages indicating script progress are also
*        displayed.
*
*        - "ATASK": Extra messages are also displayed describing each atask
*        invocation. Lines starting with ">>>" indicate the command name
*        and parameter values, and subsequent lines hold the screen output
*        generated by the command.
*
*        - "DEBUG": Extra messages are also displayed containing unspecified
*        debugging information. In addition scatter plots showing how each Q
*        and U image compares to the mean Q and U image are displayed at this
*        ILEVEL.
*
*        In adition, the glevel value can be changed by assigning a new
*        integer value (one of starutil.NONE, starutil.CRITICAL,
*        starutil.PROGRESS, starutil.ATASK or starutil.DEBUG) to the module
*        variable starutil.glevel. ["PROGRESS"]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF.
*     INSTRUMENT = LITERAL (Read)
*        Selects the tiling scheme to be used. The following instrument
*        names are recognised (unambiguous abbreviations may be supplied):
*        "SCUBA-2(450)", "SCUBA-2(850)", "ACSIS", "DAS". If the input NDF
*        contains JCMT data, the default value for this parameter is
*        determined from the FITS headers in the input NDF. Otherwise,
*        there is no default and an explicit value must be supplied. []
*     LOGFILE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of the log file to create if GLEVEL is not NONE. The
*        default is "<command>.log", where <command> is the name of the
*        executing script (minus any trailing ".py" suffix), and will be
*        created in the current directory. Any file with the same name is
*        over-written. []
*     MSG_FILTER = LITERAL (Read)
*        Controls the default level of information reported by Starlink
*        atasks invoked within the executing script. This default can be
*        over-ridden by including a value for the msg_filter parameter
*        within the command string passed to the "invoke" function. The
*        accepted values are the list defined in SUN/104 ("None", "Quiet",
*        "Normal", "Verbose", etc). ["Normal"]
*     OUT = LITERAL (Read)
*        The basename for the output NDFs. Each output NDF will have a
*        name formed by appending the integer tile index to the supplied
*        basename, preceeded by and underscore. A null (!) value causes
*        the name of the input NDF to be used.
*     RETAIN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Should the temporary directory containing the intermediate files
*        created by this script be retained? If not, it will be deleted
*        before the script exits. If retained, a message will be
*        displayed at the end specifying the path to the directory. [FALSE]
*     TRIM = _INTEGER (Read)
*        A zero or negative value results in each output NDF covering the
*        full area of the corresponding JSAtile. A value of one results in
*        each output NDF being cropped to the bounds of the supplied NDF. A
*        value of two or more results in each output NDF being cropped to
*        remove any blank borders. [2]

*  History:
*     17-JAN-2014 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     30-JAN-2014 (DSB):
*        Changed TRIM to allow output NDFs to be trimmed of any bad
*        borders.
*     26-JUN-2014 (DSB):
*        Support input NDFs that straddle a discontinuity in the HPX
*        projection.
*     2-OCT-2014 (DSB):
*        - Let jsatilelist determine the best projection to use for the JSA
*        grid (HPX, HPX12, XPHN or XPHS).
*        - Resample the SMURF extension NDFs in the same way as the main NDF.
