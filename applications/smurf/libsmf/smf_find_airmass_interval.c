*  Name:
*     smf_find_airmass_interval

*  Purpose:
*     Find the earliest or latest airmass/elevation values in a smfHead

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Subroutine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_find_airmass_interval( const smfHead * hdr, double *amstart,
*                                double * amend, double *elstart, double *elend,
*                                int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     hdr = const smfHead* (Given)
*        Header struct from data struct.
*     amstart = double * (Given)
*        Pointer to double to receive start airmass value. Can be NULL.
*     amend = double * (Given)
*        Pointer to double to receive end airmass value. Can be NULL.
*     elstart = double * (Given)
*        Pointer to double to receive start elevation value in radians.
*        Can be NULL.
*     elend = double * (Given)
*        Pointer to double to receive end elevation value in radians.
*        Can be NULL.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine determines the start and end airmass and elevation.
*     Preferentially uses the JCMTSTATE information but will fall back
*     to using the FITS header. If a value can not be determined it will
*     be set to VAL__BADD.
