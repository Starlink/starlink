*  Name:
*     smf_add_scuba2_spectral_axis

*  Purpose:
*     Add a spectral axis to a 2D SCUBA-2 map.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     smf_add_scuba2_spectral_axis( int indf, AstFitsChan *fc, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     indf = int (Given)
*        Identifier for the map. The NDF should be 2-dimensional on entry
*        and will be 3-dimensional on exit.
*     fc = AstFitsChan * (Given)
*        Pointer to a FitsCHan holding the FITS header associated with
*        the output NDF.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to inherited status.

*  Description:
*     This function adds a third pixel axis to the supplied 2D SCUBA-2
*     map, spanning a single pixel (pixel 1). It also adds a SpecFrame to
*     the current WCS Frame in the NDF, connecting the SpecFrame to the
*     new GRID axis using a WinMap that results in the spectral pixel
*     being centred at the wavelength specified by FITS header WAVELEN,
*     and having a width given by FITS header BANDWID.

*  Authors:
*     David S Berry (JAC, UCLan)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  History:
*     27-OCT-2009 (DSB):
*        Initial version.
*     27-JUN-2025 (GSB):
*        Split into two functions: this one to add specifically
*        the spectral axis for a regular SCUBA-2 observation,
*        and "smf_add_spectral_axis" (retaining the original name)
*        to add any spectral axis to a given frameset.
