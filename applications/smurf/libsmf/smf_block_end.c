*  Name:
*     smf_block_end

*  Purpose:
*     Find how many time slices pass before there is a significant shift
*     in map position.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     result = smf_block_end( smfData *data, int *block_start0,
*                             float arcerror, int maxsize, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     data = smfData * (Given)
*        Pointer to the time series data.
*     block_start0
*        Address of an int holding the index of the time slice at start of
*        block. This will be modified on exit so that it refers to the
*        next time slice for which the pol_ang value pases through zero.
*     arcerror = float (Given)
*        The maximum shift in position (in arc-seconds) allowed within a
*        single block of time slices.
*     maxsize = int (Given)
*        The maximum number of time slices allowed in a block. Zero if
*        there is no limit.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     The index of the last time slice in the block, or -1 if there are
*     no remaining time slices (or an error occurs).

*  Description:
*     This function searches through time slices in the supplied data,
*     starting at the time slice with index "block_start", until a time
*     slice is found for which the spatial position at one or more of
*     the corners of the focal plane has moved by more than "arcerror"
*     arc-seconds from its position at the start of the block. The index
*     of the final time slice is then reduced in order to ensure that the
*     whole block spans an integral number of quarter revolutions of the
*     half-waveplate, relative to focal plane Y. The index of this final
*     time slice is returned as the function value.

*  History:
*     1-FEB-2011 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     2012-03-06 (TIMJ):
*        Use SOFA instead of SLA.
*     21-SEP-2012 (DSB):
*        Take 360->zero wrap-around in POL_ANG into account when adjusting the
*        end time slice to a quarter revolution boundary.
*     7-JAN-2012 (DSB):
*        Use focal plane Y as as the POLCRD reference direction rather
*        than tracking north. Also take account of old data that uses
*        arbitrary encoder units rather than radians, and check for bad angles.
*     14-JAN-2013 (DSB):
*        Report an error if the waveplate is not spinning.
*     15-JAN-2013 (DSB):
*        Added maxsize argument.
*     9-JUL-2013 (DSB):
*        Correct algorithm for setting the block size to a multiple of pi/2.
*     10-JUL-2013 (DSB):
*        Take account of moving targets.
*     10-JUL-2015 (DSB):
*        Modify the supplied block start to make sure it corresponds to
*        pol_ang=0.
