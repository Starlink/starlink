 *  Name:
 *     sc2sim_get_drgroup.c

 *  Purpose:
 *     Return a unique data-reduction group string

 *  Language:
 *     Starlink ANSI C

 *  Type of Module:
 *     Subroutine

 *  Invocation:
 *     sc2sim_get_drgroup ( struct sc2sim_obs_struct *inx, const char *filter,
 *                          const char *object, char *drgroup, int *status )

 *  Arguments:
 *     inx = const sc2sim_obs_struct* (Given)
 *        Pointer to observation struct
 *     filter = const char* (Given)
 *        Name of filter used in this observation
 *     object = const char* (Given)
 *        Name of object observed
 *     drgroup = char* (Returned)
 *        Name of data-reduction group. Must be at least 40 characters.
 *        If the drgroup does not fit in the buffer, an empty string
 *        is returned and status remains good.
 *     status = int* (Given and Returned)
 *        Pointer to global status.

 *  Description:
 *     Determine the name of the data-reduction group used to combine
 *     data within ORAC-DR. Currently the DRGROUP string is a
 *     concatenation of the RA/Dec (or object name for moving sources),
 *     observation mode (DREAM, STARE, PONG, etc), observation type
 *     (SCIENCE, FOCUS or POINTING) and filter. The value is written as
 *     a FITS header and is thus restricted to 40 characters or less so
 *     as not to exceed the size of the FITS card.
