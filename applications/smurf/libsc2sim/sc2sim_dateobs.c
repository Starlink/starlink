 *  Name:
 *     sc2sim_dateobs

 *  Purpose:
 *     Calculate the DATE-OBS string

 *  Language:
 *     Starlink ANSI C

 *  Type of Module:
 *     SC2SIM subroutine

 *  Invocation:
 *     sc2sim_dateobs ( double mjdaystart, char *dateobs, int *status);

 *  Arguments:
 *     mjdaystart = double (Given)
 *        MJD corresponding to first sample in file
 *     dateobs = char* (Given and Returned)
 *        Dateobs string
 *     status = int* (Given and Returned)
 *        Pointer to global status.

 *  Description:
 *      This routine constructs the DATE-OBS string for the FITS header
 *      in the output files. The necessary input is the MJD at the
 *      start of the file. The DATE-OBS returned is on the same time
 *      scale as the input so it is the caller's responsibility to
 *      ensure that the returned string corresponds to the time they expect.

 *  Notes:
 *      - It's likely that this routine has re-invented the wheel so it may
 *        not be here forever.

 *     2006-12-01 (AGG):
 *        Original version
 *     2006-12-01 (AGG):
 *        String written with a single sprintf
 *     2006-12-08 (JB):
 *        Date for current chunk is precalculated by calling function.
