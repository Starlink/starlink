*  Name:
*     MAKECUBE

*  Purpose:
*     Regrid ACSIS spectra into a data cube.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     smurf_makecube( int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     This routine converts one or more raw data cubes, spanned by
*     (frequency, detector number, time) axes, into an output cube
*     spanned by (celestial longitude, celestial latitude, frequency) axes.
*
*     Optionally, the output cube can be split up into several separate
*     NDFs, each containing a spatial tile extracted from the full cube
*     (see parameter JSATILES and TILEDIMS). These tiles abut exactly in
*     pixel co-ordinates and can be combined (for example) using KAPPA:PASTE.
*
*     In addition, there is an option to divide the output up into separate
*     polarisation angle bins (see parameter POLBINSIZE). If this option
*     is selected, each tile is split up into several output NDFs (all
*     within the same container file), each one containing the input data
*     relating to a particular range of polarisation angle.
*
*     The full output cube can be either a regularly gridded tangent-plane
*     projection of the sky, or a sparse array (see parameter SPARSE).
*     If a tangent plane projection is selected, the parameters of the
*     projection from sky to pixel grid co-ordinates can be specified using
*     parameters CROTA, PIXSIZE, REFLAT, REFLON. Alternatively, parameter
*     AUTOGRID can be set true, in which case projection parameters are
*     determined automatically in a manner that favours projections that
*     place samples centrally within pixels. Alternatively, a reference
*     NDF can be supplied (see parameter REF), in which case the same pixel
*     grid will be used for the output cube.
*
*     Variance values in the output can be calculated either on the basis
*     of the spread of input dat avalues contributing to each output pixel,
*     or on the basis of the system-noise temperature values supplied in the
*     input NDFs (see parameter GENVAR).

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ALIGNSYS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*          If TRUE, then the spatial positions of the input data are
*          aligned in the co-ordinate system specified by parameter
*          SYSTEM. Otherwise, they are aligned in the ICRS co-ordinate
*          system. For instance, if the output co-ordinate system is
*          AZEL, then setting ALIGNSYS to TRUE will result in the AZEL
*          values of the input data positions being compared directly,
*          disregarding the fact that a given AZEL will correspond to
*          different positions on the sky at different times. [FALSE]
*     AUTOGRID = _LOGICAL (Read)
*          Only accessed if a null value is supplied for parameter REF.
*          Determines how the dynamic default values should be determined
*          for the projection parameters CROTA, PIXSIZE, REFLAT, REFLON,
*          REFPIX1 and REFPIX2. If TRUE, then default projection parameters
*          are determined by adjusting the grid until as many data samples as
*          possible fall close to the centre of pixels in the output cube. If
*          FALSE, REFLON/REFLAT are set to the first pointing BASE position,
*          CROTA is set to minus the MAP_PA value in the FITS header (converted
*          to the requested sky co-ordinate system), PIXSIZE is set to 6
*          arcseconds, and REFPIX1/REFPIX2 are both set to zero. [FALSE]
*     REFPIX1 = _DOUBLE (Read)
*          Controls the precise placement of the spatial tangent point on
*          the first pixel axis of the output cube. The position of the
*          tangent point on the sky is specified by REFLON/REFLAT, and
*          this sky position is placed at grid coordinates specified by
*          REFPIX1/REFPIX2. Note, these grid coordinates refer to an
*          interim grid coordinate system that does not depend on the
*          values supplied for LBND, rather than the final grid coordinate
*          system of the output cube. Therefore, if values are supplied for
*          REFPIX1/REFPIX2, they should be copies of the values written to
*          output parameter PIXREF by a previous run of MAKECUBE. The
*          REFPIX and PIXREF parameters allow an initial run of MAKECUBE
*          with AUTOGRID=YES to generate projection parameters that can
*          then be re-used in subsequent runs of MAKECUBE with
*          AUTOGRID=NO in order to force MAKECUBE to use the same pixel
*          grid. If a null (!) value is supplied, default values will be
*          used for REFPIX1/2 - either the autogrid values (if AUTOGRID=YES)
*          or (0,0) (if AUTOGRID=NO). [!]
*     REFPIX2 = _DOUBLE (Read)
*          Controls the precise placement of the spatial tangent point on
*          the second pixel axis of the output cube. See REFPIX1. [!]
*     BADMASK = LITERAL (Read)
*          A string determining the way in which bad pixels are propagated
*          from input to output. The "AND" scheme uses all input data (thus
*          reducing the noise in the output) and also minimises the number of
*          bad pixels in the output. However, the memory requirements of the
*          "AND" scheme can be excessive. For this reason, two other schemes,
*          "FIRST" and "OR", are provided which greatly reduce the memory
*          requirements, at the expense either of introducing more bad pixels
*          into the output ("OR") or producing higher output noise levels
*          ("FIRST"). The value supplied for this parameter is used only if
*          SPREAD is set to "Nearest" (otherwise "AND" is always used):
*
*          - "FIRST" -- The bad-pixel mask in each output spectrum is
*          inherited from the first input spectrum that contributes to the
*          output spectrum. Any subsequent input spectra that contribute
*          to the same output spectrum but which have a different bad-pixel
*          mask are ignored. So an output pixel will be bad if and only if
*          the corresponding pixel in the first input NDF that contributes
*          to it is bad. Since this scheme ignores entire input spectra
*          if they do not conform to the expected bad-pixel mask, the noise
*          in the output can be higher than using the other schemes. However,
*          this scheme has the benefit of using much less memory than the
*          "AND" scheme, and will in general produce fewer bad pixels in
*          the output than the "OR" scheme.
*
*          - "OR" -- The bad pixel mask in each output spectrum is the union
*          (logical OR) of the bad pixel masks for all input spectra that
*          contribute to the output spectrum. So an output pixel will be
*          bad if any of the input pixels that contribute to it are bad.
*          This scheme will in general produce more bad output pixels than
*          the "FIRST" scheme, but the non-bad output pixels will have a
*          lower noise because, unlike "FIRST", all the contributing input
*          data are coadded to produce the good output pixels. Like "FIRST",
*          this scheme uses much less memory than "AND".
*
*          - "AND" -- The bad pixel mask for each output spectrum is the
*          intersection (logical AND) of the bad pixel masks for all input
*          spectra that contribute to the output spectrum. So an output
*          pixel will be bad only if all the input pixels that contribute to
*          it are bad. This scheme will produce fewer bad output pixels
*          and will also give lower output noise levels than "FIRST" or "OR",
*          but at the expense of much greater memory requirements.
*
*          ["OR"]
*     CATFRAME = LITERAL (Read)
*          A string determining the co-ordinate Frame in which positions are
*          to be stored in the output catalogue associated with parameter
*          OUTCAT. The string supplied for CATFRAME can be one of the
*          following:
*
*          - A Domain name such as SKY, AXIS, PIXEL, etc.
*
*          - An integer value giving the index of the required Frame.
*
*          - An IRAS90 Sky Co-ordinate System (SCS) values such as
*          EQUAT(J2000) (see SUN/163).
*
*          If a null (!) value is supplied, the positions will be stored
*          in the current Frame of the output NDF. [!]
*     CATEPOCH = _DOUBLE (Read)
*          The epoch at which the sky positions stored in the output
*          catalogue were determined. It will only be accessed if an epoch
*          value is needed to qualify the co-ordinate Frame specified by
*          COLFRAME. If required, it should be given as a decimal years
*          value, with or without decimal places ("1996.8" for example).
*          Such values are interpreted as a Besselian epoch if less than
*          1984.0 and as a Julian epoch otherwise.
*     CROTA = _REAL (Read)
*          Only accessed if a null value is supplied for parameter REF.
*          The angle, in degrees, from the second pixel axis in the output cube
*          to north (in the co-ordinate system specified by the SYSTEM
*          parameter), measured north through east. The dynamic default value
*          is determined by the AUTOGRID parameter. []
*     DETECTORS = LITERAL (Read)
*          A group of detector names to include in, or exclude from, the
*          output cube. If the first name starts with a minus sign, then
*          the specified detectors are excluded from the output cube (all
*          other detectors are included). Otherwise, the specified detectors
*          are included in the output cube (all other detectors are
*          excluded). If a null (!) value is supplied, data from all detectors
*          will be used. [!]
*     EXTRACOLS = LITERAL (Read)
*          A group of names specifying extra columns to be added to the
*          catalogue specified by parameter OUTCAT. Each name should be
*          the name of a component in the JCMTState extension structure.
*          For each name in the group, an extra column is added to the
*          output catalogue containing the value of the named extension
*          item for every table row (i.e. for each data sample). These
*          extra columns can be viewed and manipulated with general-purpose
*          FITS table tools such as TOPCAT, but will not be displayed by
*          the KAPPA:LISTSHOW command. One use for these extra columns is
*          to allow the catalogue to be filtered (e.g. by TOPCAT) to
*          remove samples that meet (or do not meet) some specified
*          requirement specified by the JCMTState contents. No extra
*          columns are added if a null (!) value is supplied. [!]
*     FBL( ) = _DOUBLE (Write)
*          Sky co-ordinates (radians) of the bottom-left corner of the
*          output cube (the corner with the smallest PIXEL dimension
*          for Axis 1 and the smallest pixel dimension for Axis 2). No
*          check is made that the pixel corresponds to valid data. Note
*          that the position is reported for the centre of the pixel.
*          If SPARSE mode is enabled the positions reported will not
*          be reliable.
*     FBR( ) = _DOUBLE (Write)
*          Sky co-ordinates (radians) of the bottom right corner of the
*          output cube (the corner with the largest PIXEL dimension
*          for Axis 1 and the smallest pixel dimension for Axis 2). No
*          check is made that the pixel corresponds to valid data. Note
*          that the position is reported for the centre of the pixel.
*          If SPARSE mode is enabled the positions reported will not
*          be reliable.
*     FLBND( ) = _DOUBLE (Write)
*          The lower bounds of the bounding box enclosing the output
*          cube in the selected output WCS Frame. The values are
*          calculated even if no output cube is created. Celestial
*          axis values will be in units of radians, spectral-axis
*          units will be in the same units as the input frameset
*          (matching those used in the SPECBOUNDS parameter). The
*          parameter is named to be consistent with KAPPA:NDFTRACE
*          output. Note, the stored values correspond to the outer edges
*          of the first pixel, not to the pixel centre.
*     FUBND( ) = _DOUBLE (Write)
*          The upper bounds of the bounding box enclosing the output
*          cube in the selected output WCS Frame. The values are
*          calculated even if no output cube is created. Celestial
*          axis values will be in units of radians, spectral-axis
*          units will be in the same units of the input frameset
*          (matching those used in the SPECBOUNDS parameter). The
*          parameter is named to be consistent with KAPPA:NDFTRACE
*          output. Note, the stored values correspond to the outer edges
*          of the first pixel, not to the pixel centre.
*     FTL( ) = _DOUBLE (Write)
*          Sky co-ordinates (radians) of the top left corner of the
*          output cube (the corner with the smallest PIXEL dimension
*          for Axis 1 and the largest pixel dimension for Axis 2). No
*          check is made that the pixel corresponds to valid data. Note
*          that the position is reported for the centre of the pixel.
*          If SPARSE mode is enabled the positions reported will not
*          be reliable.
*     FTR( ) = _DOUBLE (Write)
*          Sky co-ordinates (radians) of the top right corner of the
*          output cube (the corner with the largest PIXEL dimension
*          for Axis 1 and the largest pixel dimension for Axis 2). No
*          check is made that the pixel corresponds to valid data. Note
*          that the position is reported for the centre of the pixel.
*          If SPARSE mode is enabled the positions reported will not
*          be reliable.
*     GENVAR = LITERAL (Read)
*          Indicates how the Variance values in the output NDF are to be
*          calculated. It can take any of the following values:
*
*          - "Spread" -- the output Variance values are based on the spread
*          of input data values contributing to each output pixel. This option
*          is not available if parameter SPARSE is set TRUE. If the BADMASK
*          value is "OR" or "FIRST", then a single variance value will be
*          produced for each output spectrum (i.e. all channels in an output
*          spectrum will have the same variance value). If BADMASK is "AND",
*          then an independent variance value will be calculated for each
*          channel in each output spectrum.
*
*          - "Tsys" -- the output Variance values are based on the system
*          noise temperature values supplied in the input NDFs. Since
*          each input spectrum is characterised by a single Tsys value,
*          each output spectrum will have a constant Variance value (i.e.
*          all channels in an output spectrum will have the same variance
*          value).
*
*          - "None" -- no output Variance values are created.
*
*          ["Tsys"]
*
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*          Input raw data file(s)
*     INWEIGHT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*          Indicates if the input spectra should be weighted when combining
*          two or more input spectra together to form an output spectrum.
*          If TRUE, the weights used are the reciprocal of the variances
*          associated with the input spectra, as determined from the Tsys
*          values in the input. [TRUE]
*     JSATILES = _LOGICAL (Read)
*          If TRUE, the output cube is created on the JSA all-sky pixel
*          grid, and is split up into individual JSA tiles. Thus multiple
*          output NDFs may be created, one for each JSA tile that touches
*          the cube. Each of these output NDFs will have the tile index number
*          appended to the end of the path specified by parameter "OUT". If
*          "JSATILES" is TRUE, the "REF" parameter is ignored. [FALSE]
*     JSATILELIST() = _INTEGER (Write)
*          If parameter "JSATILES" is set TRUE, the zero-based indices of
*          the created JSA tiles will be written to this output parameter.
*          The number of such indices is given the "NTILE" parameter
*     LBND( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*          An array of values giving the lower pixel-index bound on each
*          spatial axis of the output NDF. The suggested default values
*          encompass all the input spatial information. The supplied
*          bounds may be modified if the parameter TRIM takes its default
*          value of TRUE. []
*     LBOUND( 3 ) = _INTEGER (Write)
*          The lower pixel bounds of the output NDF. Note, values will be
*          written to this output parameter even if a null value is supplied
*          for parameter OUT.
*     MSG_FILTER = _CHAR (Read)
*          Control the verbosity of the application. Values can be
*          NONE (no messages), QUIET (minimal messages), NORMAL,
*          VERBOSE, DEBUG or ALL. [NORMAL]
*     NTILE = _INTEGER (Write)
*          The number of output tiles used to hold the entire output
*          array (see parameter JSATILES and TILEDIMS). If no input data
*          falls within a specified tile, then no output NDF will be created
*          for the tile, but (if JSATILES is FALSE) the tile will still be
*          included in the tile numbering scheme.
*     NPOLBIN = _INTEGER (Write)
*          The number of polarisation angle bins used to hold the entire
*          output data (see parameter POLBINSIZE).
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*          Output file. If a null (!) value is supplied, the application
*          will terminate early without creating an output cube, but
*          without reporting an error. Note, the pixel bounds which the
*          output cube would have had will still be written to output
*          parameters LBOUND and UBOUND, even if a null value is supplied
*          for OUT. If the output cube is split up into multiple output NDFs
*          (e.g. an NDF for each tile -- see parameter TILEDIMS -- or for each
*          polarisation angle bin -- see parameter POLBINSIZE), then the
*          value supplied for "OUT" will be used as the root name to which
*          other strings are appended to create the name of each output NDF.
*     OUTCAT = FILENAME (Write)
*          An output catalogue in which to store all the spatial detector
*          positions used to make the output cube (i.e. those selected using
*          the DETECTORS parameter). By default, the stored positions are in
*          the same sky co-ordinate system as the current Frame in the output
*          NDF (but see parameter CATFRAME). The label associated with each
*          row in the catalogue is the detector name. The detector positions
*          in the catalogue are ordered as follows: all the positions for
*          the first input NDF come first, followed by those for the second
*          input NDF, etc. Within the group of positions associated with a
*          single input NDF, the positions for the first time slice come
*          first, followed by the positions for the second time slice, etc.
*          If a null value (!) is supplied, no output catalogue is produced.
*          See also parameter CATFRAME. [!]
*     OUTFILES = LITERAL (Write)
*          The name of text file to create, in which to put the names of
*          all the output NDFs created by this application via parameter
*          OUT (one per line). If a null (!) value is supplied no file is
*          created. [!]
*     PARAMS( 2 ) = _DOUBLE (Read)
*          An optional array which consists of additional parameters
*          required by the Sinc, SincSinc, SincCos, SincGauss, Somb,
*          SombCos, and Gauss spreading methods (see parameter SPREAD).
*
*          PARAMS( 1 ) is required by all the above schemes. It is used to
*          specify how many pixels on either side of the output position
*          (that is, the output position corresponding to the centre of the
*          input pixel) are to receive contributions from the input pixel.
*          Typically, a value of 2 is appropriate and the minimum allowed
*          value is 1 (i.e. one pixel on each side). A value of zero or
*          fewer indicates that a suitable number of pixels should be
*          calculated automatically. [0]
*
*          PARAMS( 2 ) is required only by the SombCos, Gauss, SincSinc,
*          SincCos, and SincGauss schemes.  For the SombCos, SincSinc, and
*          SincCos schemes, it specifies the number of pixels at which the
*          envelope of the function goes to zero.  The minimum value is
*          1.0, and the run-time default value is 2.0.  For the Gauss and
*          SincGauss scheme, it specifies the full-width at half-maximum
*          (FWHM) of the Gaussian envelope.  The minimum value is 0.1, and
*          the run-time default is 1.0.  On astronomical images and
*          spectra, good results are often obtained by approximately
*          matching the FWHM of the envelope function, given by PARAMS(2),
*          to the point-spread function of the input data.  []
*     PIXREF( 2 ) = _DOUBLE (Write)
*          The grid coordinates used for the reference pixel, within the
*          interim grid coordinate system. See REFPIX1.
*     PIXSIZE( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*          Only accessed if a null value is supplied for parameter REF.
*          Pixel dimensions in the output image, in arcseconds. If only one
*          value is supplied, the same value will be used for both axes. The
*          dynamic default value is determined by the AUTOGRID parameter. []
*     POINTING = LITERAL (Read)
*          The name of a text file containing corrections to the pointing read
*          from the input data files. If null (!) is supplied, no corrections
*          are used. Note - this parameter is ignored unless parameter
*          USEDETPOS is set to FALSE. If a file is supplied, it should start
*          with one or more lines containing "#" in column one. These are
*          comment lines, but if any comment line has the form "# SYSTEM=AZEL"
*          or "# SYSTEM=TRACKING" then it determines the system in which the
*          pointing correction are specified (SYSTEM defaults to AZEL). The
*          last comment line should be a space-separated list of column names,
*          including "TAI", "DLON" and "DLAT". Each remaining line should
*          contain numerical values for each column, separated by white space.
*          The TAI column should contain the TAI time given as an MJD. The
*          DLON and DLAT columns should give arc-distance offsets parallel
*          to the longitude and latitude axes, in arc-seconds. The TAI values
*          should be monotonic increasing with row number. The longitude and
*          latitude axes are either AZEL or TRACKING as determined by the
*          SYSTEM value in the header comments. Blank lines are ignored.
*          The DLON and DLAT values are added onto the SMU jiggle positions
*          stored in the JCMTSTATE extension of the input NDFs. DLON and DLAT
*          values for non-tabulated times are determined by interpolation.
*
*          If you need to apply two sets of pointing corrections, one in
*          TRACKING and one in AZEL, you can include two tables (one for
*          each system) in a single text file. Both tables should use the
*          format described above. The two tables must be separated by a line
*          containing two or more minus signs with no leading spaces. [!]
*     POLBINSIZE = _REAL (Read)
*          This parameter is only prompted for if the input files contain
*          polarisation data. The supplied value is used as the bin size
*          (in degrees) for grouping polarisation analyser angles. The
*          first bin is centred at the angle given by parameter POLBINZERO.
*          The "analyser angle" is the anti-clockwise angle from celestial
*          north (in the system chosen by parameter SYSTEM) to the axis
*          of the "effective analyser" - a rotating analyser that would
*          have the same effect as the combination of fixed analyser and
*          half-wave plate actually present in the polarimeter. The
*          supplied value for POLBINSIZE will be modified if required to
*          ensure that a whole number of bins is used to cover the
*          complete range of analyser angles (0 to 360 degrees). A
*          separate output cube will be created for each bin that is not
*          empty, and each output NDF will contain a POLPACK extension
*          suitable for use with the POLPACK:POLCAL command. These NDFs
*          are all stored in a single HDS container file (one per tile)
*          with the name specified by parameter OUT. Within this
*          container file, each cube will be held in a component with
*          name of the form "P<N>" appended to the end, where "<N>" is an
*          integer bin index. The largest value of N is written to output
*          parameter NPOLBIN. If a null value (!) is supplied, then a
*          single output NDF (without POLPACK extension) is created for
*          each tile, containing all input data.
*     POLBINZERO = _REAL (Read)
*          This parameter is only prompted for if the input files contain
*          polarisation data. It is the analyser angle (in degrees) at the
*          centre of the first analyser angle bin. A value of zero
*          corresponds to north in the celestial co-ordinate system specified
*          by parameter SYSTEM. [0]
*     POSERRFATAL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*          If a true value is supplied, then an error is reported and the
*          application terminates if a significant difference is found
*          between the detector positions array (RECEPPOS) and positions
*          implied by the FPLANEX/Y arrays. If a false value is supplied,
*          a warning is issued but the application proceeds. See also
*          parameters POSERRMAX and USEDETPOS. [FALSE]
*     POSERRMAX = _REAL (Read)
*          Defines the maximum insignificant discrepancy between the
*          detector positions array (RECEPPOS) and positions implied by
*          the FPLANEX/Y arrays, in units of arc-seconds. See parameter
*          POSERRFATAL. [3.0]
*     REF = NDF (Read)
*          An existing NDF that is to be used to define the output grid,
*          or the string "JSA". If an NDF is supplied, the output grid will
*          be aligned with the supplied reference NDF. The NDF need not be
*          three-dimensional. For instance, a two-dimensional image can be
*          supplied in which case the spatial axes of the output cube will
*          be aligned with the reference image and the spectral axis will be
*          inherited form the first input NDF.  If "JSA" is supplied, the
*          JSA all-sky pixel grid will be used (note, the cube will still be
*          created as a single NDF - if multiple NDFs, one for each JSA tile,
*          are required, the "JSATILES" parameter should beset TRUE instead
*          of using the "REF" parameter). If a null (!) value is supplied
*          then the output grid is determined by parameters AUTOGRID, REFLON,
*          REFLAT, etc. [!]
*     REFLAT = LITERAL (Read)
*          Only accessed if a null value is supplied for parameter REF.
*          The formatted celestial-latitude value at the tangent point of
*          the spatial projection in the output cube. This should be provided
*          in the system specified by parameter SYSTEM. The dynamic-default
*          value is determined by the AUTOGRID parameter. []
*     REFLON = LITERAL (Read)
*          Only accessed if a null value is supplied for parameter REF.
*          The formatted celestial-longitude value at the tangent point of
*          the spatial projection in the output cube. This should be provided
*          in the system specified by parameter SYSTEM. The dynamic-default
*          value is determined by the AUTOGRID parameter. []
*     SPARSE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*          Indicates if the spectra in the output cube should be stored
*          as a sparse array, or as a regularly gridded array. If FALSE,
*          pixel Axes 1 and 2 of the output cube represent a regularly
*          gridded tangent plane projection of the sky, with parameters
*          determined by CROTA, PIXSIZE, REFLON and REFLAT. Each input
*          spectrum is placed at the appropriate pixel position in this
*          three-dimensional projection, as given by the celestial
*          co-ordinates associated with the spectrum. If SPARSE is TRUE, then
*          each input spectrum is given an associated index, starting from 1,
*          and the spectrum with index "I" is stored at pixel position (I,1)
*          in the output cube (pixel Axis 2 will always have the value 1 --
*          that is, Axis 2 is a degenerate axis that spans only a single
*          pixel).
*
*          In both cases, the third pixel axis in the output cube
*          corresponds to spectral position (frequency, velocity, etc).
*
*          Whatever the setting of SPARSE, the output NDF's WCS component
*          can be used to transform pixel position into the corresponding
*          (celestial longitude, celestial latitude, spectral position)
*          values. However, if SPARSE is TRUE, then the inverse transformation
*          (i.e. from (long,lat,spec) to pixel co-ordinates) will not be
*          defined. This means, for instance, that if a sparse array is
*          displayed as a two-dimensional image, then it will not be possible
*          to annotate the axes with WCS values. Also, whilst KAPPA:WCSMOSAIC
*          will succesfully align the data in a sparse array with a
*          regularly gridded cube, KAPPA:WCSALIGN will not, since WCSALIGN
*          needs the inverse transformation to be defined.
*
*          The dynamic default value for SPARSE depends on the value
*          supplied for parameter AUTOGRID. If AUTOGRID is set FALSE,
*          then SPARSE defaults to FALSE. If AUTOGRID is set TRUE, then
*          the default for SPARSE will be TRUE if the algorithm described
*          under the AUTOGRID parameter fails to find useful default grid
*          parameters. If the AUTOGRID algorithm succeeds, the default
*          for SPARSE will be FALSE. []
*     SPECBOUNDS = LITERAL (Read)
*          The bounds of the output cube on the spectral axis. Input data
*          that falls outside the supplied range will not be included in
*          the output cube. The supplied parameter value should be a
*          string containing a pair of axis values separated by white space
*          or commas. The first should be the spectral value corresponding to
*          the lower edge of the first spectral channel in the output cube, and
*          the second should be the spectral value corresponding to the upper
*          edge of the last spectral channel. The supplied values should refer
*          to the spectral system described by the WCS FrameSet of the first
*          input NDF. To see what this is, supply a single colon (":") for the
*          parameter value. This will display a description of the required
*          spectral co-ordinate system, and then re-prompt for a new parameter
*          value. The dynamic default is determined by the SPECUNION
*          parameter. []
*     SPECUNION = _LOGICAL (Read)
*          Determines how the default spectral bounds for the output are
*          chosen. If a TRUE value is supplied, then the defaults for the
*          SPECBOUNDS parameter represent the union of the spectral ranges
*          in the input data. Otherwise, they represent the intersection
*          of the spectral ranges in the input data. This option is
*          only available if parameter BADMASK is set to AND. For any
*          other value of BADMASK, a value of FALSE is always used for
*          SPECUNION. [FALSE]
*     SPREAD = LITERAL (Read)
*          The method to use when spreading each input pixel value out
*          between a group of neighbouring output pixels. If SPARSE is set
*          TRUE, then SPREAD is not accessed and a value of "Nearest" is
*          always assumed. SPREAD can take the following values:
*
*          - "Linear" -- The input pixel value is divided bi-linearly between
*          the four nearest output pixels.  Produces smoother output NDFs than
*          the nearest-neighbour scheme.
*
*          - "Nearest" -- The input pixel value is assigned completely to the
*          single nearest output pixel. This scheme is much faster than any
*          of the others.
*
*          - "Sinc" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x) kernel, where x is the pixel
*          offset from the interpolation point (resampling) or transformed
*          input pixel centre (rebinning), and sinc(z)=sin(z)/z.  Use of
*          this scheme is not recommended.
*
*          - "SincSinc" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x)sinc(k*pi*x) kernel. A
*          valuable general-purpose scheme, intermediate in its visual
*          effect on NDFs between the bi-linear and nearest-neighbour
*          schemes.
*
*          - "SincCos" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x)cos(k*pi*x) kernel.  Gives
*          similar results to the "Sincsinc" scheme.
*
*          - "SincGauss" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x)exp(-k*x*x) kernel.  Good
*          results can be obtained by matching the FWHM of the
*          envelope function to the point-spread function of the
*          input data (see parameter PARAMS).
*
*          - "Somb" -- Uses the somb(pi*x) kernel, where x is the pixel
*          offset from the transformed input pixel centre, and
*          somb(z)=2*J1(z)/z (J1 is the first-order Bessel function of the
*          first kind).  This scheme is similar to the "Sinc" scheme.
*
*          - "SombCos" -- Uses the somb(pi*x)cos(k*pi*x) kernel.  This
*          scheme is similar to the "SincCos" scheme.
*
*          - "Gauss" -- Uses the exp(-k*x*x) kernel. The FWHM of the Gaussian
*          is given by parameter PARAMS(2), and the point at which to truncate
*          the Gaussian to zero is given by parameter PARAMS(1).
*
*          For further details of these schemes, see the descriptions of
*          routine AST_REBINx in SUN/211. ["Nearest"]
*     SYSTEM = LITERAL (Read)
*          The celestial co-ordinate system for the output cube. One of
*          ICRS, GAPPT, FK5, FK4, FK4-NO-E, AZEL, GALACTIC, ECLIPTIC. It
*          can also be given the value "TRACKING", in which case the
*          system used will be which ever system was used as the tracking
*          system during in the observation. The value supplied for the
*          CROTA parameter should refer to the co-ordinate system specified
*          by this parameter.
*
*          The choice of system also determines if the telescope is
*          considered to be tracking a moving object such as a planet or
*          asteroid. If system is GAPPT or AZEL, then each time slice in
*          the input data will be shifted in order to put the base
*          telescope position (given by TCS_AZ_BC1/2 in the JCMTSTATE
*          extension of the input NDF) at the same pixel position that it
*          had for the first time slice. For any other system, no such
*          shifts are applied, even if the base telescope position is
*          changing through the observation. [TRACKING]
*     TELPOSERRMAX = _DOUBLE (Read)
*          Maximum separation between the actual position (TCS_TR_AC1/2) and
*          demand position (TCS_TR_DC1/2) in the JCMTSTATE extension (arcsec).
*          If non-zero, time slices which exceed this separation will be
*          excluded.  [0.0]
*     TILEBORDER = _INTEGER (Read)
*          Only accessed if a non-null value is supplied for parameter
*          TILEDIMS. It gives the width, in pixels, of a border to add to
*          each output tile. These borders contain data from the adjacent
*          tile. This results in an overlap between adjacent tiles equal to
*          twice the supplied border width. If the default value of zero
*          is accepted, then output tiles will abut each other in pixel
*          space without any overlap. If a non-zero value is supplied,
*          then each pair of adjacent tiles will overlap by twice the
*          given number of pixels. Pixels within the overlap border will
*          be given a quality name of "BORDER" (see KAPPA:SHOWQUAL). [0]
*     TILEDIMS( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*          This parameter is ignored if parameter "JSATILES" is set TRUE.
*
*          For large data sets, it may sometimes be beneficial to break
*          the output array up into a number of smaller rectangular tiles,
*          each created separately and stored in a separate output NDF. This
*          can be accomplished by supplying non-null values for the TILEDIMS
*          parameter. If supplied, these values give the nominal spatial size
*          of each output tile, in pixels. Edge tiles may be thinner if the
*          TRIMTILES parameter is set TRUE. In order to avoid creating very thin
*          tiles around the edges, the actual tile size used for the edge tiles
*          may be up to 10 % larger than the supplied value. This creation of
*          "fat" edge tiles may be prevented by supplying a negative value for
*          the tile size, in which case edge tiles will never be wider than
*          the supplied absolute value.
*
*          If only one value is supplied, the supplied value is duplicated to
*          create square tiles. Tiles are created in a raster fashion, from
*          bottom left to top right of the spatial extent. The NDF file name
*          specified by "out" is modified for each tile by appending "_<N>"
*          to the end of it, where <N> is the integer tile index (starting at
*          1). The number of tiles used to cover the entire output cube is
*          written to output parameter NTILES. The tiles all share the same
*          projection and so can be simply pasted together in pixel
*          co-ordinates to reconstruct the full size output array. The tiles
*          are centred so that the reference position (given by REFLON and
*          REFLAT) falls at the centre of a tile. If a tile receives no
*          input data, then no corresponding output NDF is created, but
*          the tile is still included in the tile numbering scheme. If a
*          null (!) value is supplied for TILEDIMS, then the
*          entire output array is created as a single tile and stored in
*          a single output NDF with the name given by parameter OUT
*          (without any "_<N>" appendage). [!]
*     TRIM = _LOGICAL (Read)
*          If TRUE, then the output cube will be trimmed to exclude any
*          borders filled with bad values. Such borders can be caused, for
*          instance, by one or more detectors having been excluded (see
*          parameter DETECTORS), or by the supplied LBND and/or UBND parameter
*          values extending beyond the available data. [TRUE]
*     TRIMTILES = _LOGICAL (Read)
*          Only accessed if the output is being split up into more than
*          one spatial tile (see parameter TILEDIMS and JSATILES). If TRUE,
*          then the tiles around the border will be trimmed to exclude areas
*          that fall outside the bounds of the full sized output array. This
*          will result in the border tiles being smaller than the central
*          tiles. [FALSE]
*     UBND( 2 ) = _INTEGER (Read)
*          An array of values giving the upper pixel-index bound on each
*          spatial axis of the output NDF. The suggested default values
*          encompass all the input spatial information. The supplied
*          bounds may be modified if the parameter TRIM takes its default
*          value of TRUE. []
*     UBOUND( 3 ) = _INTEGER (Write)
*          The upper pixel bounds of the output NDF. Note, values will be
*          written to this output parameter even if a null value is supplied
*          for parameter OUT.
*     USEDETPOS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*          If a true value is supplied, then the detector positions are
*          read from the detector position arrays in each input NDF.
*          Otherwise, the detector positions are calculated on the basis
*          of the FPLANEX/Y arrays. Both methods should (in the absence
*          of bugs) result in identical cubes. See also parameter
*          POSERRFATAL. [TRUE]
*     WEIGHTS = _LOGICAL (Read)
*          If TRUE, then the weights associated with the array of output
*          pixels are stored in an extension named ACSISRED, within the output
*          NDF. If FALSE the weights are discarded once they have been
*          used. These weights record the relative weight of the input
*          data associated with each output pixel. If SPARSE is set TRUE,
*          then WEIGHTS is not accessed and a FALSE value is assumed. [FALSE]

*  Notes:
*     - A FITS extension is added to the output NDF containing any keywords
*     that are common to all input NDFs. To be included in the output
*     FITS extension, a FITS keyword must be present in the NDF extension
*     of every input NDF, and it must have the same value in all input
*     NDFs. In addition, certain headers that relate to start and end
*     events are propagated from the oldest and newest files respectively.
*     - The output NDF will contain an extension named "SMURF" containing
*     two NDFs named "EXP_TIME" and "EFF_TIME". In addition, if parameter
*     SPREAD is set to "Nearest", a third NDF called "TSYS" will be created.
*     Each of these NDFs is 2-dimensional, with the same pixel bounds as the
*     spatial axes of the main output NDF, so that a pixel in one of these
*     NDFs corresponds to a spectrum in the main output NDF. EXP_TIME holds
*     the sum of the total exposure times (Ton + Toff) for the input spectra
*     that contributed to each output spectrum. EFF_TIME holds the sum of the
*     effective integration times (Teff) for the input spectra that contributed
*     to each output spectrum, scaled up by a factor of 4 in order to normalise
*     it to the reported exposure times in EXP_TIME. TSYS holds the effective
*     system temperature for each output spectrum. The TSYS array is not
*     created if GENVAR is "None" or if SPREAD is not "Nearest".
*     - FITS keywords EXP_TIME, EFF_TIME and MEDTSYS are added to the output
*     FITS extension. The EXP_TIME and EFF_TIME keywords hold the median
*     values of the EXP_TIME and EFF_TIME arrays (stored in the SMURF extension
*     of the output NDF). The MEDTSYS keyword holds the median value of the
*     TSYS array (also stored in the SMURF extension of the output NDF). If
*     any of these values cannot be calculated for any reason, the
*     corresponding FITS keyword is assigned a blank value.
*     - FITS keywords NUMTILES and TILENUM are added to the output FITS
*     header. These are the number of tiles used to hold the output data,
*     and the index of the NDF containing the header, in the range 1 to
*     NUMTILES. See parameter TILEDIMS.
