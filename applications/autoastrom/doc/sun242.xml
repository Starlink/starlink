      <px>We describe the &autoastrom; package, which
	provides an interface to the &astrom; application.

	<title>Introduction</title>
      </subhead>

      <p><strong>THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  Some features work only partially or
	  unreliably.  It does not have all the functionality of a
	  production release.  The interface may well
	  change.</strong></p>

      <p>Starlink's &astrom; application provides powerful astrometry
	facilities, for analysing astronomical images; it is, however, 
	rather cumbersome to use.  As described in SUN/5, &astrom;
	can:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p>obtain the plate centre and plate scale of a CCD image, 
	      by comparing plate positions of objects with those in a
	      reference catalogue, and fitting with both four- and
	      six-component distortion models;</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>with enough data, obtain cubic distortion and plate
	      tilt, using seven- to nine-component models;</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>if enough information is available, it will do the
	      reductions in observed place, correcting for atmospheric 
	      refraction.</p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	&autoastrom; provides a shell
	around &astrom; so that, as well as the core astrometric
	facilities of &astrom;, &autoastrom; will:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p>work on a CCD image provided as an NDF, as long as it
	      has at least rough astrometry (plate centre and scale);</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>automatically download appropriate reference catalogue
	      information from catalogue servers supported by the
	      SkyCat library;</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>insert the astrometric results into the original NDF,
	      as a WCS component;</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>alternatively or additionally make the astrometry
	      available as a set of FITS-WCS header cards.</p>
	  </li>
	</ul>

	</subhead>

	<p>To work, &autoastrom; requires some initial estimate of the 
	  centre of the CCD frame.  You can provide this with a WCS
	  component in the NDF, or with a FITS (NDF-) extension, or with
	  approximate astrometry given on the command line.  By
	  default, &autoastrom; searches for a WCS component, then a
	  FITS extension, and fails if it finds neither.</p>

	<p>You control this process using the <ref id="opt.obsdata">obsdata
	    option</ref>.</p>

	<p>If you wish to insert an initial approximate WCS component
	  in the NDF, you can best do this using GAIA.</p>

	<p>XXX Discuss how accurate this initial calibration has to be.</p>

      <subsect id="usage.results" export="export">
	<subhead>
	  <title>Results</title>
	</subhead>

	<p>Results can be inserted into the input NDF (see <ref
	    id="opt.insert"/>), or else retained as a standalone
	  FITS-WCS file (see <ref id="opt.keepfits"/>).  You can choose
	  both, either, or even choose neither and throw the results
	  away (strange person!).</p>

      <subsect id="usage.proxy" export="export">
	<subhead>
	  <title>Web proxies</title>
	</subhead>

	<p>In order to perform catalogue lookups, &autoastrom; needs
	  to make HTTP (Web) queries.  If your site enforces the use
	  of proxies to get access to the web, these lookups will
	  fail, and &autoastrom; will simply wait uselessly until its
	  queries time out.</p>

	<p>You can tell &autoastrom; how to use the proxies by using the
	  standard <code>http_proxy</code> environment variable, which 
	  you set through something like
	  <verbatim>csh% setenv http_proxy http://wwwcache.example.ac.uk:8080/</verbatim>
	  or
	  <verbatim>sh% http_proxy=http://www.example.ac.uk:8080/; export http_proxy</verbatim>
	  depending on whether you use a csh-like (tcsh) or sh-like
	  (bash, zsh) shell.</p>

	<p>Your local computing service can advise you on the
	  appropriate value for this environment variable, or you can
	  examine the appropriate part of the configuration of your
	  web browser.</p>

	  catalogue names recognised by <webref
	  url="http://archive.eso.org/skycat/" >SkyCat</webref>.  The
	  list of available catalogues depends on the configuration
	  file used (see <ref id="opt.skycatconfig"/>); the

	  <p>This indicates a pre-existing catalogue of objects in the
	    CCD frame.  This is a catalogue in the format required by
	    CCDPACK's &findoff; application, with extra fields.  That
	    is, there must be five columns: an integer identifier, the 
	    X and Y pixel positions of an object, the integer
	    identifier <em>repeated</em> and some measure of the flux
	    due to the object.  The objects must be in decreasing
	    order of the flux (the units don't matter: this is purely
	    for sorting purposes).</p>

	  <p>If this catalogue does not exist, it will be generated
	    from the image in the NDF using the SExtractor application;
	    this option is present (a) so that you can provide a
	    catalogue of objects by some other means if you wish, and
	    (b) because this extraction step is one of the more
	    time-consuming steps in the astrometry process, and so
	    allowing the catalogue to be specified can speed things up
	    in the case where you are analysing an image several
	    times.</p>

	  <p>If true, the final fit to the astrometry is inserted into
	    the input NDF as an AST WCS component.  If false
	    (<code>--noinsert</code>), the insertion is not done, so

	    low level when there is something wrong with the script
	    itself, but also when you wish to examine the sequence of
	    calls to &findoff; and &astrom;, or examine the &astrom; input and

	  <p>All the temporary files are created in a temporary

	  <p>If true, the script will pass on messages from the

	  <p>Specifies a source for the observation data, including
	    WCS information.  The keyword has the multiple role of
	    specifying the source of WCS information, supplying
	    approximate WCS information directly, and supplying the
	    observation data (time, observatory, temperature and
	    pressure, and colour) which &astrom; needs if it is to
	    attempt one of its higher-order fits.  This information is
	    only needed if it is missing from the NDF or any FITS
	    extension it incorporates, and if you wish to attempt the
	    slight increase in accuracy of the more elaborate fits.
	  </p>

	  <p>Do not specify a keyword more than once with distinct
	    values.</p>

	  <p>The value of the <code>--obsdata</code> option can specify
	    approximate astrometry through a comma-separated list of
	    <code>key=value</code> pairs.  For example, to supply a
	    plate centre, overriding any astrometry in the file, you might
	    write 
	    <verbatim>
	      --obsdata=ra=14:24:00,dec=-12.34
	    </verbatim>
	    and to supply this as a backup, in case there is no
	    astrometry elsewhere, you could write
	    <verbatim>
	      --obsdata=source=AST:FITS:USER,ra=14:24:00,dec=-12.34

	    finished, and produces a rather messy error message.  In

      <p>Build the software by unpacking the distribution tar archive, 
	and using the standard <code>./mk build</code> to build it,
	then <code>./mk install</code> to install it.</p>

      <p>If you wish to use a non-default Starlink tree to build the
	software (that is, not the standard <code>/star</code>), then
	you can specify this by setting the environment variable
	<code>STARLINK</code>: for example <code>setenv STARLINK
	  /stardev</code>.  If you need to use more than one Starlink
	tree (perhaps because you have installed updated versions of 
	some software outside the main tree; specifically, note that
	&autoastrom; requires AST version 1.8-1 or better), then use the
	<code>STARLINKS</code> variable, setting it to a
	colon-separated list of directories: for example <code>setenv
	  STARLINKS /path/to/my/star:/star</code> (this facility is
	intended primarily for developers, and you really shouldn't
	need to use it in `normal' building of the software).</p>

    <sect id="helpers" export="export">
      <subhead>
	<title>Auxiliary software</title>
      </subhead>

      <p>The script uses other Starlink software tools.  Although the
	use of these tools should be transparent, it might be of use
	to have some indication of sources of further detail.</p>


      <p>The script is largely a wrapper for &astrom;.  This is
	documented fully in SUN/5.</p>

      <p>The pattern matching facilities which the script depends on
	come from the &findoff; application within CCDPACK.  There are
	further details in SUN/139.  Need version 4.0-1 or
	better (the program searches for this in
	<code>CCDPACK_DIR</code>).</p>

      <p>The WCS information is largely handled by ATOOLS.  This does
	not have a SUN yet.   Need ATOOLS 1.3 or better
	(<code>ATOOLS_DIR</code>).</p>

      <p>&autoastrom; requires AST 1.8-1 or better to build.  Depending
	on precisely which earlier version of AST you have, the moggy
	tool will fail to compile, or if it compiles, fail to link.
	If you have AST installed in a non-standard place, you should
	use the <code>STARLINKS</code> environment variable at build
	time (see <ref id="build"/>), to tell the build script where
	to find it.</p>

      <p>It also needs StarPerl (see SUN/228).</p>

      <!--
      <p>NDFPACK and KAPPA: Ref to KAPPA docs.</p>
      -->

      <p>The concepts underlying WCS, and its interaction with
	FITS-WCS, are described in the AST documentation.  See SUN/210
	and 211.</p>

      <p>Extraction of the object catalogues from the CCD is done by
	Extractor, which is the Starlink version of Emmanuel Bertin's
	SExtractor.  Extractor is documented in SUN/226.  The original
	SExtractor source is available at
	<url>http://www.tass-survey.org/tass/software/software.html#sextract</url>,
	and the documentation is available at Starlink sites as MUD/165
	(Postscript only).</p>

      <p>If you need to supply the initial astrometry which this
	script requires, you can do that using GAIA.  This is
	documented in SUN/214, but it's very easy to use, and you
	might be best to simply start it up (give the command
	<code>gaia image_name</code>, presuming you have already done
	the initialisation to use Starlink software) and experiment.

	<p>The program moggy uses the ESO SkyCat library for its
	  catalogue access.  However, note that, for the sake of
	  consistency, it does <em>not</em> honour the SkyCat
	  <code>CATCONFIG</code> variable directly.  If you need to
	  specify an alternative SkyCat configuration file, you should 
	  do that with the <code>--skycatconfig</code> option instead
	  (see <ref id="opt.skycatconfig"/>).</p>

      <p>Very soon, it will be possible to specify the initial
	estimate astronmetry on the command-line, rather than by
	using GAIA to create WCS information within the NDF.  As an
	alternative route, the application will be modified to attempt 
	to find such astrometry within any FITS headers attached to
	the image.</p>

      <p>As a longer-term goal, it might be possible to automate even
	this, if there is some reasonable way of estimating
	plate-centre and plate-scale information <foreign>ex
	  nihil</foreign>, from the pattern of objects in the plate.</p>

      <p>At present, only one CCD can be processed at a time.  It
	would be useful if the application could process images from
	multiple CCDs, arranged in a mosaic.</p>

      <subsect id="restrictions" export="export">
	<subhead>
	  <title>Restrictions and limitations</title>
	</subhead>

	<p>The script inherits some limitations from &astrom;, and some
	  from CCDPACK's &findoff;.</p>

	<p>The limitations due to &astrom; are as follows (quoted from
	  SUN/5, sect.&nbsp;5):</p>

	<p>&astrom; aims to deliver results better than 1&nbsp;arcsec
	  from typical Schmidt plate measurements, and better than
	  0.1&nbsp;arcsec from carefully measured JKT and AAT plates
	  <foreign>etc</foreign>.  Astrometric specialists will,
	  nonetheless, be aware of a number of shortcomings, including
	  the following:
	  <ul>
	    <li><p>The fit is limited to a 6-coefficient linear model
	    plus cubic distortion and plate tilt.  Colour effects --
	    arising for example from chromatic aberrations in the
	    camera optics -- are not allowed for, no magnitude or
	    image shape terms are included in the model, and the
	    refraction cannot be adjusted automatically.</p>
	    </li>

	    <li><p>The zonal distortions of the reference catalogues are
		neglected.</p></li>

	    <li><p>There is no provision for the simultaneous fitting
	    of more than one plate.  This prevents an extended area
	    being modelled via overlapping plates, and the
	    determination of proper motion and parallax from plates
	    taken at different epochs.</p>
	    </li>

	    <li><p>Only rudimentary error information is produced.</p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  Despite these limitations, which stem mainly from the need
	  for simplicity of use, the accuracy of the result tends in
	  practice to be dominated by the quality of the input data
	  rather than by &astrom; itself.</p>

	<p>Further, &astrom; requires that at least 10 reference stars
	  are available.  Since &autoastrom; obtains its reference stars 
	  from well-stocked catalogues, this is not a problem in
	  practice.</p>

	<p>The restrictions arising from &findoff; are similarly slight, 
	  and should not be a problem if the initial astrometry is
	  good enough.  It's not at present <em>completely</em> clear
	  exactly what `good enough' means.</p>
