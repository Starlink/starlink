#  Name:
#     FINDCOORDS
#  Purpose:
#     Find the coordinates of a named astronomical object.
#  Language:
#     Perl 5.
#  Type of Module:
#     Perl script (with interaction via the command-line).
#  Description:
#     Find the equatorial coordinates of a named astronomical object.
#     The coordinates are obtained by submitting a remote query via
#     the Internet to the version of the SIMBAD name resolver maintained
#     by ESO.  If the given name is found in the SIMBAD database then
#     the coordinates of the object are displayed.  The Right Ascension
#     is shown in sexagesimal hours and the Declination in sexagesimal
#     degrees; both are for equinox J2000.
#  Usage:
#      findcoords  object-name
#  Arguments:
#     object-name (read)
#        The name of an astronomical object whose coordinates are to be
#        found.  It should be entered without embedded spaces.  The case
#        of letters (upper or lower) is not significant.  For example:
#        NGC3379.
#  Environment Variables:
#        None.
#  Examples:
#     findcoords  ngc3379
#        Find the equatorial coordinates of the galaxy NGC 3379.  The
#        coordinates returned are for equinox J2000.
#  Algorithm:
#     Note that findcoords is a simple wrap-around for the name-resolver
#     function of catremote.  catremote is documented in SSN/76.
#
#     Set the variable holding the location of the catremote script.
#     Set the catremote environment variables.
#     If there is more than one command-line argument then
#       Extract the first command-line argument as the object name.
#       Assemble the catremote query.
#       Submit the query.
#     else
#       Print usage details.
