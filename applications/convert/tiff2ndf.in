#  Name:
#     tiff2ndf

#  Purpose:
#     Converts a TIFF file into an NDF.

#  Type of Module:
#     Bourne shell script

#   Usage:
#     tiff2ndf in [out]

#  Description:
#      This Bourne-shell script converts a 256 grey-level or
#      black-and-white dithered Tag Image File Format (TIFF) into an
#      unsigned-byte NDF file.  It handles one- or two-dimensional
#      images.  The script uses various Netpbm utilities to produce a
#      FITS file, flipped top to bottom, and then FITS2NDF to produce
#      the final NDF.  Error messages are converted into Starlink style
#      (preceded by !).

#  Parameters:
#     IN = FILENAME (Read)
#        The name of the TIFF file to be converted. (A .tif name extension
#        is assumed if omitted.)
#     OUT = NDF (Write)
#        The name of the NDF to be generated (without the .sdf extension).
#        If the OUT parameter is omitted, the value of the IN parameter
#        is used.

#  Examples:
#     tiff2ndf old new
#        This converts the TIFF file old.tif into an NDF called old
#        (in file old.sdf).
#     tiff2ndf horse
#        This converts the TIFF file horse.tif into an NDF called horse
#        (in file horse.sdf).

#  Notes:
#     -  This initial version of the script handles only greyscale
#     or b/w dithered images.  You are responsible for conversion of
#     your images to this format prior to use, including the
#     conversion of RGB values to brightness values.
#
#     -  Input image file names must have the extension .tif.
#
#     -  The Netpbm utilities tifftopnm, ppmtopgm, pnmflip and pnmtofits
#        must be available on your PATH.

#  History:
#     1995 March 3 (MJC):
#        Original version (GIFs).
#     1995 November 2 (GJP):
#        Converted to TIFF requirements from GIF.
#     1995 November 13 (AJC):
#        Added fileout parameter, and error reporting and exit at each
#        stage.  Use long temporary filenames.
#     1997 August 1 (MJC):
#        Removed KAPPA dependencies.  Reworded and reordered the
#        description.  Added some comments.  Used a special tifftopnm
#        for alpha_OSF1.
#     1997 October 3 (MJC):
#        Improved the parameter handling to allow for no arguments, and
#        to remove any .tif that may be present in the first argument.
#     1998 November 19 (AJC):
#        Use Netpbm - common for all platforms
#          Use pnmtofits not pgmtofits
#     1999 March 11 (AJC):
#        Only remove .tif if at end of name
