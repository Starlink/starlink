#  Name:
#     ndf2gif

#  Purpose:
#     Converts an NDF into a GIF file.

#  Type of Module:
#     Bourne shell script

#  Usage:
#     ndf2gif in [out] [scale] {high=? low=?
#                              {percentiles=[?,?], [numbin=?]
#                              {sigmas=[?,?]

#  Description:
#     This Bourne shell script converts an NDF into a 256 grey-level
#     Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) file.  One- or two-dimensional
#     images can be handled and various methods of scaling the data are
#     provided.  The script uses the CONVERT utility NDF2TIFF to produce
#     a TIFF file and then various Netpbm utilities to convert the TIFF
#     file into a GIF file.
#
#     Error messages are converted into Starlink style (preceded by !).

#  Parameters:
#     IN = NDF (Read)
#        The name of the input NDF (the .sdf extension is not required).
#     OUT = FILENAME (Write)
#        The name of the GIF file to be generated.  (A .gif name extension
#        is added if it is omitted.) If OUT is omitted, the value of the IN
#        parameter is used.  Any existing file with the same name will be
#        overwritten.
#
#     The following parameters are actually parameters of the ADAM task
#     NDF2TIFF. Their values on the NDF2GIF command line are just passed
#     through to NDF2TIFF, which may prompt for other required values.
#     The output parameters SCAHIGH and SCALOW will be found in NDF2TIFF's
#     parameter file.
#
#     SCALE = LITERAL (Read)
#        The type of scaling to be applied to the array.  [Range]
#        The options, which may be abbreviated to an unambiguous string
#        and are case-insensitive, are described below:
#          "Range"       - The image is scaled between the minimum and
#                          maximum data values. (This is the default.)
#          "Faint"       - The image is scaled from the mean minus one
#                          standard deviation to the mean plus seven
#                          standard deviations.
#          "Percentiles" - The image is scaled between the values
#                          corresponding to two percentiles.
#          "Scale"       - You define the upper and lower limits
#                          between which the image is to be scaled.  The
#                          application suggests the maximum and the
#                          minimum values when prompting.
#          "Sigmas"      - The image is scaled between two standard-
#                          deviation limits.
#     HIGH = _DOUBLE (Read)
#        Only required if SCALE is "Scale".
#        The array value that scales to 255 in the TIFF file.
#        All larger array values are set to 255 when HIGH is greater than
#        LOW, otherwise all array values less than HIGH are set to 255.
#        The dynamic default is the maximum data value.  There is an
#        efficiency gain when both LOW and HIGH are given on the
#        command line, because the extreme values need not be computed.
#        The highest data value is suggested in prompts.
#     LOW = _DOUBLE (Read)
#        Only required if SCALE is "Scale".
#        The array value that scales to 0 in the TIFF file.
#        All smaller array values are also set to 0 when LOW is less than
#        HIGH, otherwise all array values greater than LOW are set to 0.
#        The dynamic default is the minimum data value.  There is an
#        efficiency gain when both LOW and HIGH are given on the
#        command line, because the extreme values need not be computed.
#        The lowest data value is suggested in prompts.
#     NUMBIN  =  _INTEGER (Read)
#        Only used if SCALE is "Percentiles".
#        The number of histogram bins used to compute percentiles for
#        scaling. (Percentiles mode) [2048]
#     PERCENTILES( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
#        Only required if SCALE is "Percentiles".
#        The percentiles that define the scaling limits. For example,
#        [25,75] would scale between the quartile values.
#     SIGMAS( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
#        Only required if SCALE is "Sigmas".
#        The standard-deviation bounds that define the scaling limits.
#        To obtain values either side of the mean both a negative and
#        a positive value are required.  Thus [-2,3] would scale
#        between the mean minus two and the mean plus three standard
#        deviations.  [3,-2] would give the negative of that.
#     SCAHIGH = _DOUBLE (Write)
#        The array value scaled to the maximum colour index for display.
#     SCALOW = _DOUBLE (Write)
#        The array value scaled to the minimum colour index for display.
#     MSG_FILTER = The output message filtering level, QUIET, NORMAL or
#        VERBOSE. If set to verbose, the scaling limits used will be
#        displayed. [NORMAL]

#  Examples:
#     ndf2gif old new
#        This converts the NDF called old (in file old.sdf)
#        into a GIF file new.gif.
#     ndf2gif horse scale=percentiles
#        This converts the NDF called horse (in file horse.sdf)
#        into a GIF file horse.gif using percentile scaling.
#        The user will be prompted for the percentiles to use.

#  Notes:
#     -  This initial version of the script handles only 256 grey
#     levels and does not use the image colour lookup table so
#     absolute data values may be lost.
#
#     -  The Netpbm utilities tifftopnm and ppmtogif must be available
#     on your PATH.
