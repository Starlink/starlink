*  Name:
*     EXTRACTCLUMPS

*  Purpose:
*     Extract previously identified clumps of emission from an NDF.

*  Language:
*     C

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Description:
*     This application extract previously identified clumps of emission
*     from a 1, 2 or 3 dimensional NDF. Usually, FINDCLUMPS will first be
*     used to identify the clumps within a given array, and then
*     EXTRACTCLUMPS can be used to find the parameters of the same clumps
*     in a second array.
*
*     Two input NDFs are supplied; the NDF associated with parameter DATA
*     contains the physical data values from which the clumps are to be
*     extracted, whilst the NDF associated with parameter MASK contains
*     integer values that identify the clump to which each pixel belongs. The
*     two NDFs are assumed to be aligned in PIXEL coordinates. An output NDF
*     is created that is a copy of the MASK NDF. Parameters describing the
*     clumps extracted from the DATA NDF are stored in the CUPID extension
*     of the output NDF, and may also be stored in an output catalogue.
*     These are in the same form as the clump parameters created by the
*     FINDCLUMPS command.

*  Usage:
*     extractclumps mask data out outcat

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BACKOFF = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, the background level in each clump is removed from the
*        clump data values before calculating the reported clump sizes and
*        centroid position. This means that the clump sizes and centroid
*        position will be independent of the background level. The
*        background level used is the minimum data value in the clump. If
*        FALSE, the full data values, including background, are used when
*        calculating the clump sizes and centroid position. This means that
*        clumps on larger backgrounds will be reported as wider than similar
*        clumps on smaller backgrounds. Using BACKOFF=FALSE allows the
*        comparison of clump properties generated by EXTRACTCLUMPS with those
*        generated by the IDL version of CLUMPFIND (see also the ClumpFind
*        configuration parameter "IDLAlg"). Note, the other reported
*        clump properties such as total data value, peak data value, etc,
*        are always based on the full clump data values, including
*        background. [TRUE]
*     FWHMBEAM = _REAL (Read)
*        The FWHM of the instrument beam, in pixels. If DECONV is TRUE, the
*        clump widths written to the output catalogue are reduced (in
*        quadrature) by this amount. The default value is the value stored
*        in the CONFIG component of the CUPID extension in the mask NDF, or
*        2.0 if the CUPID extension does not contain a CONFIG component. []
*     DATA = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF containing the physical data values.
*     DECONV = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Determines if the clump properties stored in the output catalogue
*        and NDF extension should be corrected to remove the effect of the
*        instrumental beam width specified by the FWHMBEAM and VELORES
*        parameters. If TRUE, the clump sizes will be reduced and the peak
*        values increased to take account of the smoothing introduced by the
*        beam width. If FALSE, the undeconvolved values are stored in the
*        output catalogue and NDF. Note, the filter to remove clumps smaller
*        than the beam width is still applied, even if DECONV is FALSE. [TRUE]
*     JSACAT = NDF (Read)
*        An optional JSA-style output catalogue in which to store the clump
*        parameters (for KAPPA-style catalogues see parameter "OUTCAT"). No
*        catalogue will be produced if a null (!) value is supplied.
*        The created file will be a FITS file containing a binary table.
*        The columns in this catalogue will be the same as those created
*        by the "OUTCAT" parameter, but the table will in also hold the
*        contents of the FITS extension of the input NDF, and CADC-style
*        provenance headers. [!]
*     LOGFILE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of a text log file to create. If a null (!) value is
*        supplied, no log file is created. [!]
*     MASK = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF containing the pixel assignments. This will
*        usually have been created by the FINDCLUMPS command.
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The output NDF.
*     OUTCAT = FILENAME (Write)
*        An optional KAPPA-style output catalogue in which to store the clump
*        parameters (for JSA-style catalogues see parameter "JSACAT"). See the
*        description of the OUTCAT parameter for the FINDCLUMPS command for
*        further information.
*     SHAPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the shape that should be used to describe the spatial
*        coverage of each clump in the output catalogue. It can be set to
*        any of the strings described below. If it is set to "None", the
*        spatial shape of each clump is not recorded in the output
*        catalogue. Otherwise, the catalogue will have an extra column
*        named "Shape" holding an STC-S description of the spatial coverage
*        of each clump. "STC-S" is a textual format developed by the IVOA
*        for describing regions within a WCS - see
*        http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/STC-S.html for details.
*        These STC-S desriptions can be displayed by the KAPPA:LISTSHOW
*        command, or using GAIA. Since STC-S cannot describe regions within
*        a pixel array, it is necessary to set parameter WCSPAR to TRUE if
*        using this option. An error will be reported if WCSPAR is FALSE. An
*        error will also be reported if the WCS in the input data does not
*        contain a pair of scelestial sky axes.
*
*        - Polygon: Each polygon will have, at most, 15 vertices. If the data
*        is 2-dimensional, the polygon is a fit to the clump's outer boundary
*        (the region containing all godo data values). If the data is
*        3-dimensional, the spatial footprint of each clump is determined
*        by rejecting the least significant 10% of spatial pixels, where
*        "significance" is measured by the number of spectral channels that
*        contribute to the spatial pixel. The polygon is then a fit to
*        the outer boundary of the remaining spatial pixels.
*
*        - Ellipse: All data values in the clump are projected onto the
*        spatial plane and "size" of the collapsed clump at four different
*        position angles - all separated by 45 degrees - is found (see the
*        OUTCAT parameter for a description of clump "size"). The ellipse
*        that generates the closest sizes at the four position angles is then
*        found and used as the clump shape.
*
*        - Ellipse2: The above method for determining ellipses works well
*        for clumps that are in fact elliptical, but can generate extremely
*        long thin ellipses for clumps are far from being ellitical. The
*        "Ellipse2" option uses a different method for determining the best
*        ellipse based on finding many marginal profiles at one degree
*        intervals of azimuth, and using the longest marginal profile as
*        the major axis. The ellipse is centred at the clump centroid.
*
*        - Ellipse3: The same as "Ellipse2" except that the ellipse is
*        centred at the clump peak, rather than the clump centroid, and 
*        the pixel data values are used as weights when forming the mean 
*        radial distance at each azimuth angle.
*
*        In general, ellipses will outline the brighter, inner regions
*        of each clump, and polygons will include the fainter outer
*        regions. The dynamic default is "Polygon" if a JSA-style
*        catalogue (see parameters JSACAT) is being created, and "None"
*        otherwise. Note, if a JSA-style catalogue is being created an
*        error will be reported if "Ellipse", "Ellipse2", "Ellipse 3"
*        or "None" is selected. []
*     VELORES = _REAL (Read)
*        The velocity resolution of the instrument, in channels. If DECONV is
*        TRUE, the velocity width of each clump written to the output
*        catalogue is reduced (in quadrature) by this amount. The default
*        value is the value stored in the CONFIG component of the CUPID
*        extension in the mask NDF, or 2.0 if the CUPID extension does not
*        contain a CONFIG component. []
*     WCSPAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a TRUE value is supplied, then the clump parameters stored in
*        the output catalogue and in the CUPID extension of the output NDF,
*        are stored in WCS units, as defined by the current coordinate frame
*        in the WCS component of the input NDF (this can be inspected using
*        the KAPPA:WCSFRAME command). For instance, if the current
*        coordinate system in the input NDF is (RA,Dec,freq), then the
*        catalogue columns that hold the clump peak and centroid positions
*        will use this same coordinate system. The spatial clump sizes
*        will be stored in arc-seconds, and the spectral clump size will
*        be stored in the unit of frequency used by the NDF (Hz, GHz, etc).
*        If a FALSE value is supplied for this parameter, the clump
*        parameters are stored in units of pixels within the pixel coordinate
*        system of the input NDF. The dynamic default for this parameter is
*        TRUE if the current coordinate system in the input NDF represents
*        celestial longitude and latitude in some system, plus a recogonised
*        spectral axis (if the input NDF is 3D). Otherwise, the dynamic
*        default is FALSE. []
