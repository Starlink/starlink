#  Name:
#     cupid_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against adam cupid.

#  Language:
#     Bourne Shell

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a makefile command to
#     create a monolith in Starlink standard makefiles, thus:
#
#         $(ALINK) $(MONO_OBJECT) -o $(MONOLITH) $(OBJECT_LIBRARIES) \
#             -L$(STAR_LIB) `./cupid_link_adam`

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building ADAM applications
#     which use cupid in order to generate the correct arguments for the
#     compiler (or ld) command. The arguments generated are written to
#     the standard output.
