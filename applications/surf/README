SURF

   This is the SURF root directory.
   Contains a readme and a makefile. This makefile can be used to
   build surf in a non-starlink way

  Make targets:

     all (default): build and link surf
     export:   create tar files required for Starlink distribution
     clean: clean intermediate files
     distclean: make really clean (includes built files)
     
    The export target does not create the documentation (latex)
    archives.


   Sub directories:

     src
       This is the basic SURF source code and includes the 
       surf_*.f|F, IFL files
       Requires that sculib, surf_kap and surflib have been built
       before linking

     scripts
       Contains the perl, icl and csh scripts required by SURF.

     misc
       Contains the miscellaneous files (such as calibrator signal
       files) that are not actual source code

     sculib
       source code for libsculib

     surflib
       source code for libsurflib

     surf_kap
       KAPPA source code required for SURF

     starlink
       Starlink build system (mk and makefile)


The targets supporteed by the non-starlink makefile system are:

    default target builds library and links monolith
    also creates links to necessary include files

    export: creates tar files required by Starlink build system

  Note that there will probably be no install target. The Starlink
system will be used for that.
