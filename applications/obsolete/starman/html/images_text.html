 <h2> 1 <a name="images"> Images </h2> </a> <p>

    
 
  Starman has some image handlers ready for use. These are the
  IM-programs, and they have their own help. There is also the
  'Interact' program, the main image display interaction program.
<p>

 <h2> 2 <a name="formats"> Formats </h2> </a> <p>

In an ideal world you would not need to know how your data are stored. The
storage mechanism would be transparent, and you would perceive your data
directly through the programs.  However, for historical reasons there
are numerous data formats in astronomical software, and at the moment you have
to be aware how your data is stored. Starman is no exception to this.
It uses the ADAM image format and you need to know a
little bit about this to use the programs properly.
<p>

The Starman suite of programs uses a simple data format for storing images
in. Images are stored on disk as `SDF' files. Thus an called 'fred' will be
stored as 'fred.sdf' on disk. (As with the tables, inside any Starman
program, you do not use the `.sdf' suffix in referring to the image.) 
<p>

Both 'real' format and 'short' format images can be used. The 'real'
format uses 4 bytes per pixel, and the 'short' format only 2 bytes
per pixel. However, the 'short' format needs care with handling.
<p>
 
It is important to understand the limitations of the precision. see
the `Precision' help below.
<p>
 
There is some progress being made for a system whereby the programs
can read images in a number of other formats (e.g. IRAF, FITS, etc.),
but this is only just becominmg available. Check whether this is
here by trying to read data in such formats.
<p>

 <h2> 3 <a name="what_is_in_an_image"> What is in an image </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  An image is a 2-D array of numbers. The numbers in an image are
  considered as stored in individual `pixels'. The coordinates are
  called 'X' and 'Y'.
<p>
 
  The numbers are stored with a precision of about 1 in 10 million
  for 'real' images, and with a precision of about 1 in 50000 for
  'short' images, but see the `help' in `Starman images precision' for
  more detail on this.
<p>
 
  Each image also has two descriptors, BSCALE and BZERO. These
  are used so that the value of a pixel is:-
<p>
 
      Value = BSCALE*(disk value) + BZERO
<p>
 
  Generally you need not be aware of this, but again see the
  `Starman images precision' help.
<p>
 
  Each image also has a pixel magic value descriptor, `INVAL'.
  This is used to flag `bad' pixels. A pixel having this
  value (its `stored' value, not necessarily its 'true' value)
  will be considered by the programs as being a `bad' one
  and dealt with specially.
<p>
 
  The image also has a descriptor 'TITLE', a 50 long character
  string. It does not form any part of the image itself, but can
  be accessed by the user as a source of additional personal
  information about the image. Thus for example an image called
  'VFLAT' (stored as vflat.sdf on disk), could have a title of:- 
<p>
       'This is a flat field for the V filter' 
<p>
  This title is then available for inspection by the user, say by
  the program `Imdes', and may be put out to the user by some
  programs to show the user something about the image.
<p>
 
  The image may also have any number of further descriptors,
  added by the user, or input via `Imfits&#95 dr', or by some other
  programs.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4 <a name="precision"> Precision </h2> </a> <p>

The numbers in an image can have any value, but there is an actual storage
matter. On the disk (or on tape), the numbers are coded either into 16-bit
integers (short format) or as 32-bit reals (real format).
<p> 

Each image has assigned a scale (BSCALE) and a zero (BZERO), which are
applied to all the numbers in an image. Thus the number actually stored is:-
<p>

         Stored value = (true value-BZERO)/BSCALE
<p>
 
  Thus if an image has BZERO 900,000.0 and BSCALE 10.0, then
  a value of 1,000,000 will be stored as 10,000.
<p>
 
  Similarly, when a program reads an image from disk or tape,
  it will get the true value by:-
<p>
 
         True value = (Stored value)*BSCALE + BZERO
<p>
 
All calculations inside a program are done in real single precision
arithmetic, accurate to about 1 part in 10 million.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4.1 <a name="real format"> Real format </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  Numbers are stored as 32-bit real numbers, with possible values
  between +/- 10 to the 37. The accuracy is about 1 part in 10 million.
<p>
 
 
  In most real images, BSCALE is set at 1.0, and BZERO at 0.0.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 4.2 <a name="short format"> Short format </h2> </a> <p>
 
 

Numbers are stored into 16-bit integers.
<p>

Thus if a program wants to store a number of value (say) 1,000,000 it cannot
do this directly, as a 16-bit number can only have a value between -32768
and +32767. So each image often has to make use of the scale (BSCALE) and
zero (BZERO) values, which are applied to all the numbers in an image.
<p>

The advantage of this is that images are generally half the
size of a `real' image. This means that disk and tape
storage problems are halved, and reading and writing images
into and out of programs is faster.
<p>
 
A disadvantage of this is that the precision of stored values is
only about 1 in 60000. This is however good enough for most
astronomical work.
<p>
 
Another disadvantage is that one has to be careful about
dynamic range. If one wanted to store an image whose values
varied between 0.8 and 1.2, with a precision of 0.0001 (say a
flat field), then it would be no good storing this with
the common default of (BSCALE=1.0,BZERO=0.0), as the values
would actually stored as the INTEGERS `0' and '1', and on
reaccessing them, they would then only have the values
of 0.0 and 1.0. They way round this is to put the BSCALE
and BZERO appropriately. Thus for this example, a BSCALE of
0.0001 and a BZERO of 0.0 would store the numbers as integers
between 8000 and 12000, which would then be able to be
accessed as values between 0.8 and 1.2 with steps of 0.0001,
as is desired.
<p>
 
The programs deal with this generally without you having
to think about it, but some programs (IMFITS&#95 DR for example in
certain cases) will not do this, so you have to think before you
use them.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 5 <a name="coordinates"> Coordinates </h2> </a> <p>

The bottom-left-hand pixel in an image is called the (1,1) pixel. Each
pixel is thought of stretching for one pixel coordinate wide. Thus the
blh pixel is thought of as stretching from 0.0 to 0.9999.. in X and Y,
with its centre at (0.5,0.5).

<pre> 
  The general programs to deal with images as images are:-
  ----------------------------------------------------------
 
  Name          Function
  ----          --------
 
 imcalc         Apply maths to an image or to any combination of images
 imcube         Cut a 2-D image out of a 3-D or 4-D image
 imcut          Make another image (sectioned,binned,inverted)

 There are other programs which handle images. These are listed
 in the other 'help' sections. Amongst these the most relevant here is:-
 
  Name          Function
  ----          --------
 Interact       Interact with a displayed image
 Tbplot         Plot table graph/histogram - image picture/contour
</pre> 
<p>
 
 
<hr>
 <h2> 7 <a name="image_display"> Image display </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
  Images can be simply displayed on any X-device.
<p>
 
  Sometimes if you are on a remote device, you will need to do
  the Starlink utility `xdisplay'.
<p>
 
  Also any device, including hardcopy, can be used to output a greyscle
  plot of an image  by using the image graphical output in the INSPECT
  option in the INTERACT program.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 8 <a name="conversion_from_other_systems"> Conversion from other systems </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
If you have images in the FITS/FIGARO formats, there are programs in
Starman and KAPPA which you can use to convert them to the .SDF format used
by Starman.
<p>

<pre> 
  Format                 Conversion program
  ------                 --------------------
  FITS (disk)            imfits_dr
  ADAM (=HDS/NDF/SDF)    import 
  Figaro (=DST)          dst2ndf in KAPPA, then import
  FITS                   fitsin in KAPPA, then import
</pre> 
<p>

As the ADAM and Figaro conversion programs usually give you `Real' images,
you can then use IMTYPE to convert them to the 16-bit Integer*2 `Short'
format optional use in Starman. (Remember the possible use of scaling to
avoid under/overflow.)
<p>
 
The image made from Figaro or HDS may be 3-D or 4-D. You can use
'imcube' to extract the desired 2-D plane out of the image.
<p>
 
If you are in real trouble, use those packages to write a FITS tape
and read the files in with \verb|fitsin| in KAPPA.
<p>
 
<hr>
 <h2> 9 <a name="conversion_to_other_systems"> 
 Conversion to other systems </h2> </a> <p>
 
 
To put images into the FITS/ADAM/FIGARO formats, there
programs in in ADAM and Figaro which you can use to convert them to
the desired format from the .SDF format used by Starman.
<p>
<pre> 
 
  Format                 Conversion program
  ------                 --------------------
  ADAM (=HDS/NDF/SDF)    import in Starman (converts descriptors)
  Figaro (=DST)          dst2ndf2dst in KAPPA, after import
  FITS                   fitsout in KAPPA, after import
  FITS (disk)            dfitsout in KAPPA, after import
</pre> 
<p>
 
If your Starman images are in the `short' format, then as the ADAM
and Figaro conversion programs usually work with `real'
images, you will have to use 'imtype' to convert the normal Starman
16-bit Integer*2 `short' formats to `real', before converting them.
<p>
 
You should then use 'import' to copy descriptors in the FITS or
FIGARO extensions.
