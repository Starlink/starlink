\subsubsection{Requirements}%
%\subsection{Requirements}%
\index{requirements|(}\html{\\}%
The translator makes use of several utilities all of which
are freely available on most platforms.
You may use \appl{Archie}\htmladdnormallinkfoot{\html{ }}%
{http://www.pvv.unit.no/archie/},
or other Web-searching tools such as \appl{FTP search}%
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{\html{ }}{http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/ftpsearch},
to find the source code of any utilities you might need.

\medskip\noindent
For the best use of \latextohtml{} you want to get the latest
versions of all the utilities that it uses. (It will still work
with earlier versions, but some  special effects may not be possible.
The specific requirements are discussed below.)
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \Perl{} version 5.002, or later;
\item \appl{DBM} or \appl{NDBM}, the Unix DataBase Management system;
\item \LaTeX, meaning \LaTeXe{} at patchlevel 4, or later;
\item \fn{dvips} or \fn{dvipsk}, at version 5.58 or later;
\item \appl{Ghostscript} at version 4.02 or later;
\item the \fn{netpbm} library of graphics utilities.
\end{itemize}
\Perl{} should be compiled to use the \fn{csh} or \fn{tcsh} shell,
though \latextohtml{} can also be made to work with the \fn{bash} shell.

\medskip\htmlrule
\medskip\noindent
More specific requirements for using \latextohtml{}
depend on the kind of translation you would like to perform, as follows:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\index{requirements!minimal}%
\textbf{\LaTeX{}  commands but without equations, figures, tables, etc.} \hfill
\begin{itemize}
\item
\htmladdnormallink{Perl}{ftp://ftp.uu.net/languages/perl/}
\begin{small}
(version 4.0 - RCSfile: perl.c,v - Revision: 4.0.1.8 - Date:
1993/02/05 19:39:30 - Patch level: 36).
\end{small}\html{\smallskip}

\textbf{Warning~1: }%
You really \emph{do} need \Perl{} at patch level 36 or later.\\
\strikeout{Versions of \latextohtml{} earlier than 0.7a4 work \emph{only} with
\Perl{ 4} at patch level 36.\\}
Versions of \latextohtml{} up to \textsc{v97.1} work
both with \Perl{ 4} at patch level 36 and \Perl{ 5}\,,
though some of the packages may only work with \Perl{ 5}\,.\html{\\}
\emph{No}~version
of \latextohtml{} will work  with \Perl{ 4} at earlier patch levels.\html{\\}
Future versions, from \textsc{v97.2} onwards,
may require \Perl{ 5} in order to operate at all.


\textbf{Warning~2: }\index{requirements!Unix shell}%
Various aspects of \Perl{}, which are used by \latextohtml{}, assume
certain system commands to be provided by the operating system shell.
If \fn{csh} or \fn{tcsh} is used to invoke \latextohtml{}
then everything should work properly.
\Perl{ 5.003} eliminates this requirement on the shell.

\textbf{Warning~3: }\index{requirements!special packages}%
Some of the packages which implement advanced features,
such as the \env{natbib} and \env{frames} packages,
require \Perl{ 5}\,.

\index{requirements!DataBase Management system}%
\item
\appl{DBM} or \appl{NDBM}, the Unix DataBase Management system.
\end{itemize}

\index{requirements!for full graphics}%
\index{tables!as images}\index{images!tables}%
\index{images!figures}\index{images!equations}%
\item
\textbf{\LaTeX{}  commands with equations, figures, tables, etc.} \\
As above plus \dots
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \fn{latex};
%
\index{dvips@\texttt{dvips} version}
\item
\htmladdnormallink{\texttt{dvips}}
{ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/pub/archive/dviware/dvips}
(version~5.516 or later) or \fn{dvipsk};
%
\index{Ghostscript@\textsl{Ghostscript} version}
\item
\fn{gs} \appl{Ghostscript} (version 2.6.1 works;
versions from 3.33 onwards are preferable, up to at least 5.01);
%
\index{image conversion!Postscript@\PS\ to GIF}%
\index{GIF!image conversion}%
\item
The \htmladdnormallink{\texttt{pbmplus}}{ftp://ftp.x.org/R5contrib/}
or \htmladdnormallink{\texttt{netpbm}}{ftp://ftp.x.org/R5contrib/} library.
Some of the filters in those libraries are used during the \PS\ to
GIF conversion.
\end{itemize}


\index{requirements!for segmentation feature}%
\index{segmentation!needs latex2e@needs \LaTeXe}%
\item
\textbf{\htmlref{Segmentation}{Segmentation} of large documents}\\
If you wish to use this feature, you will have to upgrade your
\LaTeX{} to \LaTeXe\,.
Some other hyperlinking features also require \LaTeXe\,.

\index{requirements!for transparent images}%
\index{images!transparent}%
\item
\textbf{\htmladdnormallinkfoot{Transparent inlined images}%
{http://melmac.corp.harris.com/transparent\_images.html}}\\
If you dislike the white background color of the
generated inlined images then you should get either
the \fn{netpbm} library (instead of the older \fn{pbmplus})
or install the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{\texttt{giftrans}}%
{ftp://ftp.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/pub/net/www/tools/giftrans.c}
filter by Andreas Ley \Email{ley@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de}.
Version 1.10.2 is known to work without problems,
but later versions should also be OK.
%
\end{enumerate}

\index{requirements!without images}%

\noindent
If \appl{Ghostscript} or the \fn{pbmplus} (or \fn{netpbm}) library are not
available, it is still possible to
use the translator with the \Cs{no\_images} option.

\index{requirements!for special features}\index{special!features}%
\index{html.sty@\texttt{html.sty} style-file!needed for special features}%
\html{\\}%

If you intend to use any of the \htmlref{special features}{sec:hyp}
of the translator \latex{(see page~\pageref{sec:hyp})}
then you have to include the \fn{html.sty} file
in any \LaTeX{}  documents that use them.

\index{browser!supports images}%
\index{Mosaic@\textsl{Mosaic}|see{\htmlref{browser}{IIIbrowser}}}%
\index{NCSA Mosaic@\textsl{NCSA Mosaic}|see{\htmlref{browser}{IIIbrowser}}}%
\index{Netscape@\textsl{Netscape Navigator}|see{\htmlref{browser}{IIIbrowser}}}%
\index{browser!\textsl{NCSA Mosaic}}%
\index{browser!\textsl{Netscape Navigator}}%
\html{\\}%

Since by default the translator makes use of inlined images in the final
\texttt{HTML} output, it would be better to have a viewer
which supports the \HTMLtag{IMG} tag, such as \htmladdnormallink{\textsl{NCSA Mosaic}}%
{http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/help-about.html}
or \htmladdnormallink{\textsl{Netscape Navigator}}{http://home.netscape.com}.
\cbversion{97.1}\begin{changebar}
Any browser which claims to be compatible with \HTMLiii{} should meet
this requirement.
\end{changebar}

\index{browser!character-based}%
\index{browser!character-based}\index{browser!lynx@\textsl{lynx}}%
\html{\\}%

If only a character-based browser, such as \appl{lynx}, is available,
or if you want the generated documents to be more portable,
then the translator can be used with the \Cs{ascii\_mode}
\hyperref{option}{option (see Section~}{)}{asciimode}.

\subsubsection{Installing \protect\latextohtml}%
%\subsection{Installing \protect\latextohtml}%
\index{installation}\html{\\}%
To install \latextohtml{} you \textbf{MUST} do the following:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\textbf{Specify where \Perl{} is on your system}. \\
In each of the files \fn{latex2html}, \fn{texexpand}, \fn{pstoimg},
\fn{install-test} and \fn{makemap},
modify the first line saying where \Perl{} is on your system.

\index{installation!without Perl@without \Perl{} shell scripts}

\noindent
Some system administrators do not allow \Perl{} programs to run as shell scripts.
This means that you may not be able to run any of the above programs.
\emph{In this case change the first line in each of these programs from }
\html{\smallskip}
%begin{latexonly}
\begin{small}
%end{latexonly}
\verb|#!/usr/local/bin/perl |
%begin{latexonly}
\end{small}
%end{latexonly}
\html{\smallskip}\emph{to}:
%begin{latexonly}
\begin{small}
%end{latexonly}
\begin{verbatim}
# *-*-perl-*-*
    eval 'exec perl -S  $0 "$@"'
    if $running_under_some_shell;
\end{verbatim}
%begin{latexonly}
\end{small}
%end{latexonly}

\index{installation!change configuration}%
\item
In the file \fn{latex2html.config} give the correct path-names for
some directories (the \fn{LATEX2HTMLDIR} directory \strikeout{and the
\fn{pbmplus} or \fn{netpbm} library})
and some executables (\fn{latex}, \fn{dvips}\strikeout{, \fn{gs}}).

Choose or set up the icon server as explained in the comments.

\index{installation!change defaults}

While you're at it you may want to change some default
options in the same file.

\index{installation!check path-names}%
\index{installation!graphics utilities}%
\item
\textbf{Run \fn{install-test}\,.} \\
This \Perl{} script will make some changes in the \fn{latex2html} file
and then check whether the path-names to any external utilities
required by \fn{latex2html} are correct.
It will not actually install the external utilities.
\cbversion{97.1}\begin{changebar}
\fn{install-test} asks you whether to configure for \fn{GIF} or
\fn{PNG} image generation.
Finally it creates the file \fn{local.pm} which houses pathnames for the
external utilities determined earlier.
\end{changebar}

Don't forget to make \fn{install-test} executable
(using the \fn{chmod} command) if necessary, before using it.
You may also need to make the files \fn{pstogif},
\fn{texexpand}, \fn{configure-pstoimg} and \fn{latex2html} executable
if \fn{install-test} fails to do it for you.

\index{installation!system installation}%
\item If you didn't have done it before, copy the files to the named
\fn{LATEX2HTMLDIR} directory.
The executable script \fn{latex2html} may reside outside this directory.


%%\cbversion{97.1}\begin{changebar}
%%\textbf{Run \fn{configure-pstoimg} }\Meta{format} \\
%%The \Meta{format} should be either \Cs{gif} or \Cs{png}
%%according to the type of images that you wish to be generated by \latextohtml.
%%
%%This \Perl{} script creates a file called \fn{local.pm} which contains
%%complete paths to the various  utilities which \fn{pstoimg}
%%will use as it generates graphics. This file can be edited later if new
%%the script fails to find a particular utility, or a new version
%%becomes available. In particular a variable \fn{\$TMP} can also be set
%%to indicate a temporary directory to use while generating images.\html{\\}
%%Alternatively variables can be assigned values on the
%%command-line; run

%%\html{\smallskip}%
%%to see the full range of options.
%%\end{changebar}
%%\html{\smallskip}%

\item
\index{installation!LaTeX packages}%
\textbf{\LaTeX\ packages:} Copy the contents of the \fn{texinputs/ }
directory to a place where they will be found by \LaTeX.
\end{enumerate}

\cbversion{97.1}\begin{changebar}
Note that you must run \fn{install-test} now (formerly you needn't).
If you want to reconfigure \latextohtml{} for \fn{GIF}/\fn{PNG} image
generation or because some of the external tools changed the location, run
\fn{install-test} again.
\end{changebar}

\medskip\htmlrule[50\% center]
\noindent
This is usually enough for the main installation, but you may also
want to do some of the following, to ensure that advanced features
of \latextohtml{} work correctly on your system:
\begin{itemize}
\index{html.sty@\texttt{html.sty} style-file!location}%
\index{installation!environment variable}%
\item
\textbf{To use the new \LaTeX{}  commands
which are defined in \fn{html.sty}:}\\
Make sure that \LaTeX{}  knows where the \fn{html.sty} file is,
either by putting it in the same place as the other style-files on your system,
or by changing your \fn{TEXINPUTS} shell environment variable,
or by copying \fn{html.sty} into the same directory as your \LaTeX{}  source file.
\index{html.sty@\texttt{html.sty} style-file!symbolic link}%
\cbversion{96.1}\begin{changebar}
\strikeout{If you are still using \LaTeX{} V2.09,
you must change the symbolic link \fn{html.sty}
from \fn{html2e.sty} to \fn{html209.sty}.}\\
\emph{Also make sure that} \fn{TEXINPUTS} \emph{includes} `\texttt{..}'
else \latextohtml{} will not work properly.
(On some systems, the command \fn{latex} is really a shell script
which sets some environment variables and calls the real \fn{latex}.
If this is so for you,
make sure that this shell script sets \fn{TEXINPUTS} properly.)
This environment variable is not to be confused with
the \latextohtml{} installation variable \fn{\$TEXINPUTS} described next.
\par

\index{installation!input-path variable}%
\item
There is an installation variable in \fn{latex2html.config}
called \fn{\$TEXINPUTS},
which tells \latextohtml{} where to look for \LaTeX{} style-files to process.
It can also affect the input-path of \LaTeX{} when called by \latextohtml,
unless the command \fn{latex} is really a script
which overwrites the \fn{\$TEXINPUTS} variable
prior to calling the real \fn{latex}.
This variable is overridden by the environment variable of the same name
if it is set.

\index{installation!fonts-path variable}%
\item
The installation variable \fn{\$PK\_GENERATION} specifies which
fonts are used in the generation of mathematical equations.  A value
of ``\texttt{0}'' causes the same fonts to be used as those for the default
printer.  Because they were designed for a printer of much greater
resolution than the screen, equations will generally appear to be
of a lower quality than is otherwise possible.  To cause \latextohtml{} to
dynamically generate fonts that are designed specifically for the
screen, you should specify a value of ``\texttt{1}'' for this variable.
If you do, then check to see whether your version of \texttt{dvips}
supports the command-line option \Cs{mode}\,.  If it does,
then also set the installation variable \fn{\$DVIPS\_MODE} to
a low resolution entry from \fn{modes.mf}, such as \fn{toshiba}.
\cbversion{96.1f}\begin{changebar}%
It may also be necessary to edit the \fn{MakeTeXPK} script,
to recognise this mode at the appropriate resolution.%
\end{changebar}
\cbversion{97.1}\begin{changebar}%
If you have \PS\ fonts available for use with \LaTeX{} and \fn{dvips}
then you can probably ignore the above complications and simply
set \fn{\$PK\_GENERATION} to ``\texttt{0}''
and \fn{\$DVIPS\_MODE} to \texttt{\char34\char34} (the empty string).
You must also make sure that \fn{gs} has the locations of the
fonts recorded in its \fn{gs\_fonts.ps} file. This should already be the case
where \appl{GS-Preview} is installed as the viewer for \texttt{.dvi}-files,
using the \PS\ fonts.
\end{changebar}

If \fn{dvips} does \emph{not} support the \Cs{mode} switch,
then leave \fn{\$DVIPS\_MODE} undefined, and verify that the
\fn{.dvipsrc} file points to the correct screen device and its
resolution.

\index{installation!filename-prefix}\label{autoprefix}%
\item
The installation variable \fn{\$AUTO\_PREFIX}
allows the filename-prefix to be automatically set
to the base filename-prefix of the document being translated.
This can be especially useful for multiple-segment documents.

\index{installation!Linux@\textsl{Linux} systems}%
\item
On certain \appl{Linux} systems it is necessary to uncomment
the line ``\texttt{use GDBM\_File}'' in the \fn{latex2html}
and \fn{install-test} scripts, to define the interface to the
data\-base-management routines.

\index{installation!makemap script@\texttt{makemap} script}%
\index{CERN!image-map server}\index{NCSA!image-map server}%
\item
The \fn{makemap} script also has a configuration variable \fn{\$SERVER},
which must be set to either \texttt{CERN} or \texttt{NCSA},
depending on the type of Web-server you are using.
\end{changebar}\par

\index{installation!initialization files}%
\index{initialization file!per user}%
\label{initfile}%
\item \textbf{To set up different initialization files:}\\
For a ``per user'' initialization file,
copy the file \fn{dot.latex2html-init} in the home directory
of any user that wants it, modify it according to her preferences and
rename it as \ \fn{.latex2html-init}. At runtime, both the
\fn{latex2html.config} file and \fn{\$HOME/.latex2html-init} file will be
loaded, but the latter will take precedence.

\index{initialization file!per directory}%

You can also set up a ``per directory'' initialization file by
copying a version of \ \fn{.latex2html-init} in each directory you
would like it to be effective. An initialization file
\path{/X/Y/Z/.latex2html-init} will take precedence over all other
initialization files if \path{/X/Y/Z} is the ``current directory'' when
\latextohtml{} is invoked.

\index{initialization file!incompatible with early versions}%
\begin{quotation}\noindent
\textbf{Warning: }%
This initialization file is incompatible with
any version of \latextohtml\ prior to \textsc{v96.1}\,.
Users must either update this file in their home directory,
or delete it altogether.
\end{quotation}

\index{installation!icons subdirectory@\texttt{icons/ } subdirectory}%
\item \label{icondir}%
\textbf{To make your own local copies of the \latextohtml{} icons:} \\
Please copy the \fn{icons/ } subdirectory to a
place under your WWW tree
where they can be served by your server.
Then modify the value of the \fn{\$ICONSERVER} variable in
\fn{latex2html.config} accordingly.
\index{installation!local icons}%
\cbversion{97.1}\begin{changebar}%
Alternatively, a local copy of the icons can be included within
the subdirectory containing your completed \texttt{HTML} documents.
This is most easily done using the \Cs{local\_icons} command-line switch,
or by setting \fn{\$LOCAL\_ICONS} to ``\texttt{1}'' in \fn{latex2html.config}
or within an initialization file, as described \htmlref{above}{initfile}.
\end{changebar}

\index{Livermore, California }%
\begin{quotation}\noindent
\textbf{Warnings: }%
If you cannot do that, bear in mind that these icons will have
to travel from Livermore, California!!!
Also note that several more icons were added in \textsc{v96.1}
that were not present in earlier versions of \latextohtml.
\end{quotation}

\index{installation!create manual}%
\index{documentation!test of installation}%
\item
\textbf{To make your own local copy of the \latextohtml{}
documentation:} \\
This will also be a good test of your installation.
% To do it run \latextohtml{} on the file \fn{docs/manual.tex}.
% You will get better results if you run \LaTeX{} first on the
% same file in order to create some auxiliary files.
%
\index{documentation!dvi version@\texttt{.dvi} version}%
\cbversion{96.1f}\begin{changebar}%

%begin{latexonly}
\begin{small}
%end{latexonly}
\texttt{ make manual.dvi}
%begin{latexonly}

The 3rd run of \fn{latex} is needed to adjust page-numbering for the Index
and Glossary within the Table-of-Contents.

\noindent
Next, the \texttt{HTML} version is obtained by typing:

%begin{latexonly}
\begin{small}
%end{latexonly}
\texttt{make manual.html}
%begin{latexonly}
\end{small}
%end{latexonly}

\noindent
This initiates a series of calls to \latextohtml{} on the separate
segments of the manual;
the full manual is thus created as a ``segmented document''
(see \hyperref{a later section}{Section~}{}{Segmentation}).
The whole process may take quite some time,
as each segment needs to be processed at least twice,
to collect the cross-references from other segments.

\index{documentation!requirements}\html{\\}%
\noindent
The files necessary for correct typesetting of the manual to be
found within the \fn{docs/ } subdirectory.
They are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
%
\index{html.sty@\texttt{html.sty} style-file}%
\index{documentation!style-files}%
\item
style-files:
 \fn{l2hman.sty}, \fn{html.sty}, \fn{htmllist.sty}, \fn{justify.sty},\\
  \fn{changebar.sty} and \fn{url.sty}
%
\index{documentation!input files}%
\item
inputs:
 \strikeout{\fn{changes.tex},} \fn{credits.tex}, \fn{features.tex}, \fn{hypextra.tex},\\
 \fn{licence.tex}, \fn{manhtml.tex}, \fn{manual.tex}, \fn{overview.tex},\\
 \fn{problems.tex}, \fn{support.tex} and \fn{userman.tex}
%
\index{documentation!graphics}%
\item
sub-directory:
 \fn{psfiles/ } containing \PS\ graphics
 used in the printed version of this manual
%
\index{documentation!images}%
\item
images of small curved arrows: \fn{up.gif}, \fn{dn.gif}
%
\index{documentation!filename data}%
\item
filename data:
 \fn{l2hfiles.dat}
%
\index{documentation!auxiliaries}%
\item
auxiliaries:
 \fn{manual.aux}, \fn{manual.ind}, \fn{manual.gls}
%
\end{itemize}

The last three can be derived from the others, but are included for convenience.

\index{documentation!Changes section}%
\item

\textbf{To get a printed version of the `Changes' section: }\\
Due to the burgeoning size of the \fn{Changes} file with successive
revisions of \latextohtml, the `Changes' section is no longer
normally included as part of the printed version of the manual.
If you want this, then find the line \html{\smallskip}
%begin{latexonly}
\begin{small}
%end{latexonly}
\Lc{input}\verb|{changes.tex}|
%begin{latexonly}
\end{small}
%end{latexonly}
\html{\smallskip}
within \fn{docs/manual.tex}\,,
and comment-out the surrounding \env{htmlonly} environment.
Remake the manual as in the preceding item;
the repeated runs of \fn{latex} are required to adjust the index,
glossary and table-of-contents for the extra information.
Up to 20 extra pages may be added.%
\cbversion{97.1}\begin{changebar}%
The changes made for the \textsc{v97.1} release are far too extensive
to be included here. Instead they can be obtained from the
\htmlref{developer's repository}{cvsrepos}%
using the \appl{CVS} version-control software.
As yet there is no typeset version.
