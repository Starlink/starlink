#  Name:
#     RESLOG

#  Purpose:
#     Enables logging of resource (time + memory usage) of large processes
#     run from its parent shell (e.g. a shell script)

#  Language:
#     C shell

#  Description:
#     The script records the time and memory usage of the largest 
#     process to have run since the last time an external 'label' file
#     was altered, and logs this information to a file.
#
#     It works as follows.  The script spends most of its time sleeping, 
#     but at intervals wakes up and takes a look at what processes are 
#     running, which have the same parent as it does.  It takes note
#     of the largest (biggest memory usage) and records the current 
#     CPU and elapsed time values, and the maximum so far total virtual
#     memory use and resident set size (i.e. real memory use).
#     Every time the contents of a given external label file are changed
#     (presumably by the parent process) it writes the contents of the 
#     label file (typically the name of the process which has been 
#     running), plus a summary of the resource usage since last time 
#     the label file was changed, to a log file.
#     The only communication between the parent and this process, 
#     after it is started, is via the label file.
#
#     Accuracy of the summary will necessarily depend on the length of
#     the intervals during which the script sleeps.  In particular 
#     it cannot be expected to report accurately on processes whose
#     elapsed time is comparable with, or shorter than, the interval time, 
#     and may miss reporting on these altogether.  
#     The figures recorded therefore are lower limits, since if the 
#     logged process exceeds these values between the last time the
#     logging process checks it, and its termination, then these
#     larger values will be missed.  Underestimation of times should
#     not however be (much) more than the sleep interval, and if
#     a large memory requirement is only in effect for a short time,
#     it's probably not very important anyway.
#
#     Inevitably running this script will interfere
#     with the process(es) being measured; although this script is 
#     not a heavy user of CPU time, the disk activity caused by 
#     loading the various commands in it may have a significant impact
#     on the performance of the machine in the event that there is
#     heavy use of disks, especially if this is caused by heavy paging
#     activity.
#
#     Only direct children of the parent process will be identified for
#     logging.  Children of children etc are excluded, which means, e.g.,
#     that processes started from scripts started from the parent process
#     will be ignored.
#
#     If this process receives an interrupt, or if it detects that its
#     parent no longer exists, it will terminate.

#  Implementation status:
#     Determining resource usage is inherently a highly system-dependent
#     task, and the script cannot be expected to be portable to 
#     arbitrary platforms.  In particular the 'ps' command, which has
#     to be used heavily, exists in two very differnt forms, one 
#     descending from BSD and one from Sytem V Unix.
#     The script as it stands appears to work on the following systems:
#        Red Hat Linux 5.0
#        Solaris 2.6
#     however it's likely to be sensitive to details of the systems it's
#     running on.  There may also be problems, for instance, if (e.g. 
#     for a process with very high memory usage) the columns from ps 
#     run into each other.
#
#     Although this script was designed for use with the CCDBIG script, 
#     there is no reason (apart from the caveats above) it shouldn't be 
#     applicable to assessing resource usage for other sets of 
#     applications.

#  Parameters:
#     If the -h flag is used on the command line a usage message 
#     (list of options and defaults) is printed, and execution is 
#     terminated.
