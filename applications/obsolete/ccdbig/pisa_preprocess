# This script takes the output of a PISAFIND run (the pisafind.dat file)
# and prepares it to make it useful for supplying to the program which
# generates large object files for use with ccdgenerate.
#
# It does two things:
#
#  1. scales the data so that each object has x,y coordinates between
#       0 and 1.
#  2. sorts the points in order of intensity.
#
# The point of this is so that the first N lines of the resulting file
# can be used by a program picking out N objects to put in a synthetic
# CCD frame (which can have an arbitrary size).  Thus a frame with the 
# required density of objects can be generated.

# Format of pisafind.dat file is:
#    Column   Name       Description
#     1        INDEX      Index number of object.
#     2        XPOS       X position of object in pixels.
#     3        YPOS       Y position of object in pixels.
#     4        INTENSITY  Integrated intensity of object.
#     5        NPIX       Number of pixels above threshold.
#     6        PEAK       Peak intensity of object in one pixel.
#     7        ELLIPT     Ellipticity of object.
#     8        ANGLE      Orientation of object, anti-clockwise from y-axis
