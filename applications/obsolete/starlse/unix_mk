#  Name:
#     mk

#  Purpose:
#     Invoke make to build and install the STARLSE package.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should normally be used to invoke the make utility to
#     build and install the STARLSE package and to perform other
#     housekeeping tasks. It invokes the make utility after first
#     defining appropriate environment variables and macros for the
#     computer system in use. This file also serves to document the
#     systems on which STARLSE is implemented.

#  Invocation:
#     The user of this script should normally first define the SYSTEM
#     environment variable to identify the host computer system (see
#     the "Supported Systems" section). This script should then be used
#     in the same way as the make utility would be used. For instance,
#     to build, install and test STARLSE, you might use the following
#     commands:
#
#        mk build
#	 mk install
#	 mk test
#	 mk clean

#  Supported Systems:
#     The following UNIX systems are currently supported and may be
#     identified by defining the SYSTEM environment variable
#     appropriately before invoking this script:
#        mips
#           DECstations running Ultrix
#        sun4
#           SUN Sparcstations running SunOS
#
#     This script will exit without action if the SYSTEM environment
#     variable is not defined. A warning will be issued if it is
#     defined but is not set to one of the values above. In this case,
#     no additional environment variables will be defined by this
#     script (any that are pre-defined will be passed on to make
#     unaltered).

#  External Dependencies:
#     The STARLSE package depends on LSE, which is part of DECset. This
#     must previously have been installed on the machine where STARLSE
#     is to be built or used.

#  Targets:
#     The following targets are provided in the associated makefile for
#     use via this script:
#     
#        [help]
#	    This is the default target. It outputs a message describing
#	    this script and lists the targets provided.
#        check
#	    Performs a simple check that all necessary source files are
#	    present, and displays the version number and current state
#	    of the package (built/installed/tested, etc.).
#        build
#	    Compiles the source files and creates all files needed
#	    prior to installing the package for use.
#        install
#	    Installs the package for use by putting the necessary files
#	    into sub-directories of the $INSTALL directory (the $HOME
#	    directory is used if the environment variable INSTALL is
#	    not defined). Links to the installed files are left in the
#	    source directory.
#        deinstall
#	    Reverses the action of the install target, removing files
#	    from sub-directories of the $INSTALL directory and
#	    restoring them to the source directory (the $HOME directory
#	    is used by default if the environment variable INSTALL is
#	    not defined).
#        test
#	    Builds and runs a simple test program to check for correct
#	    installation of the package.
#        export
#	    Produces an export copy of the built package suitable for
#	    passing to another user. A compressed tar file is created
#	    in the $EXPORT directory containing copies of the source
#	    files and built files for the package (the current
#	    directory is used by default if the environment variable
#	    EXPORT is not defined). The package should normally be
#	    built, installed and tested before using this target. After
#	    unpacking the exported file on a similar machine, the
#	    recipient may simply install it for use.
#        export_source
#	    Produces an export copy of the source for the package
#	    suitable for passing to another user to build (possibly on
#	    a different type of machine). A compressed tar file is
#	    created in the $EXPORT directory containing copies of just
#	    the source files for the packge (the current directory is
#	    used by default if the environment variable EXPORT is not
#	    defined). After unpacking the exported file, the recipient
#	    must build the package before installing it for use.
#        clean
#	    Cleans up after building the package, removing all
#	    intermediate files created during the building process, but
#	    leaving the built files themselves.
#        unbuild
#	    Reverses the building process, removing all intermediate
#	    files along with all the built files.

#  Notes on Porting:
#     If your machine or system setup does not appear in this script,
#     then it should be possible to build and install STARLSE, so long
#     as DECset is available, by adding a new case to this script with
#     appropriate definitions (probably based on one of the existing
#     implementations).

#  make Macros:
#     The following "global" make macros are used in the associated
#     makefile and may be changed by means of appropriate environment
#     variable definitions (in each case the default is shown in
#     parentheses). Note that these macros are provided to allow
#     external control over the directories in which software is
#     installed, etc., so they should not normally be re-defined within
#     this script.
#     
#        STARLINK (/star)
#	    Pathname of the root directory beneath which Starlink
#	    software is currently installed. This indicates to STARLSE
#	    where to find other Starlink software (include files,
#	    libraries, etc.) which it uses.
#        INSTALL ($HOME)
#	    Pathname of the root directory beneath which STARLSE will
#	    be installed for use. Your home directory will be used by
#	    default. This macro is provided to allow STARLSE to be
#	    installed locally for personal use (e.g. during development
#	    or testing). It should be set to the $STARLINK directory if
#	    you want to add STARLSE into an already installed set of
#	    Starlink software. You should ensure that the appropriate
#	    sub-directories appear on any relevant search paths which
#	    your system uses for locating software (e.g. binaries and
#	    libraries).
#        EXPORT (.)
#	    Pathname of the directory into which compressed tar files
#	    will be written if the "export" or "export_source" make
#	    targets are used to produce an exportable copy of STARLSE
#	    or its source files. The current working directory (i.e.
#	    the STARLSE source directory) will be used by default.
#
#     The following "local" make macros are used in the associated
#     makefile and should normally be over-ridden (when appropriate) by
#     environment variable definitions within this script. In each case
#     the default is shown in parentheses.
#
#        LINK (ln)
#	    The command required to establish a link to a file. The
#	    default assumes POSIX.2 behavior, which only provides a
#	    "hard" link operating within a single file system. If the
#	    host operating system allows "symbolic" links, then this
#	    macro might be re-defined as 'ln -s'. Alternatively, if the
#	    use of multiple file systems is essential but not supported
#	    by any form of link, then a copy command could be
#	    substituted (e.g. 'cp -p'), at some cost in file space.
#	 TAR_IN (pax -w -v -x ustar -f)
#	    Command to use to insert a file into a .tar archive file.
#	    The default uses the POSIX.2 pax command, which is not
#	    available on traditional UNIX systems. These typically use
#	    a tar command such as 'tar -cvhf' instead (if symbolic
#	    links are supported, then an option to follow these must be
#	    included in this command).
#	 TAR_OUT (pax -r -f)
#	    Command to use to extract a file from a .tar archive file.
#	    The default uses the POSIX.2 pax command, which is not
#	    available on traditional UNIX systems. These typically use
#	    a tar command such as 'tar -xf' instead.
