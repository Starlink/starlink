<H1>Introduction to Portable-CGS4DR</H1>
<P>
The fourth generation <i>cooled grating spectrometer</i>, CGS4, is designed to 
operate on UKIRT in the 1-5 &#181;m region of the electromagnetic spectrum 
at resolutions in the range 300-20000 (Mountain et al. 1990, Ramsay 1993). To reduce background noise, 
it is maintained on the telescope in vacuum at cryogenic temperatures. It achieved first light
at UKIRT on 4 February 1991 (Carswell et al. 1991). On 22 April 1995 a
new InSb 256x256 array was commissioned into the instrument.
The new array having a dark current of <b>&lt;&lt;</b> 1 electron/second and a
read noise of around 40 electrons/integration, is much more sensitive
than previous detectors. On any given spectroscopic night, an observer
can expect to acquire and reduce ~100 Mb of high quality data with CGS4.
<P>
To an observer, the system appears as two black boxes: the data
acquisition system and the data reduction system (Wright et al. 1994).
Both are under the direct control of the observer and can be
manipulated to deal with a wide variety of astronomical configurations.
The data is, therefore, both acquired and reduced in real-time at the
telescope.
<P>
This document describes the CGS4 data reduction system now called
Portable-CGS4DR. The software has been carefully designed and tested
under the Figaro (Shortridge 1993) and ADAM (Lawden &amp; Hartley 1992)
environments under Unix.  The data files produced by Portable-CGS4DR
are readable by standard Figaro applications although not all may
handle the quality and error arrays correctly.
<P>
For best results, Portable-CGS4DR should be run on a single user
workstation having at least 32 Mb of main memory and a colour monitor.
It can, of course, run on a dumb terminal and display to any Starlink supported graphics device.
