<p>This is developers' release 0.7.

<p>This is the first release intended to be practically useful to
those not directly connected with the SGML project.  It is not a final
release: still to come is some fine-tuning of the document structure
(probably, and in the light of the anticipated flood of comments and
suggestions), some redesigning of the format of the output, and an
otherwise invisible (we hope) reimplementation of the back-end,
building on the experience we gained in the first attempt, and
possibly shifting to new tools.

<p>That provisionality aside, this release should be able to do
everything the old <code/star2html> system could do, and more, with the
potential for <em/much> more in the future.

<subsubsect>New in this release

<p>Substantial additions, including
<ul>

<li>The handling of routine prologues is now complete (see <ref
id=doccode/>).  The formatted
output of these has been designed to appear very much like the old LaTeX
and <code/star2html> format, except where implementation
considerations made this particularly tricky.

<li>There is a down-converter to translate routine prologues into
<code/HLP> text (see <ref id=proc.sgml2hlp/>).

<li>Added a <ref id=el.sun.span>span</ref> element to allow you to
select variants depending on the output media type.

<li>The upconverters have been significantly developed (see <ref
id=upconvert/>).

</ul>
