<!-- This paragraph-content DTD has been modified so that it can be
     used as part of either an SGML or an XML DTD.  Part of this
     modification was parameterising the tag-omission specifiers so
     that they could be defined away when used within an XML DTD.  We
     therefore have to define these here, in such a way that this acts
     as an SGML DTD by default, in case they haven't been
     defined already.  This means that this DTD can be used from
     within an SGML DTD without modifying that DTD (eg, the
     programcode DTD).

<!-- The lists below can be added to by declaring these entities.  You
     can add to the element contents by defining any of the entities
     %additional...., to be a list of elements, defined elsewhere,
     starting with an OR connector.

     %additional.special aren't allowed in PX.

<!ENTITY % additional.special		"">
<!ENTITY % additional.structuring	"">
<!ENTITY % additional.simplephrase	"">
<!-- also %additional.references: see Feature.Bodycontent.References below -->

<!--========== Element classes ==========-->
<!-- %phrase: different types of phrase display within text.
     distinction between %simplephrase and %phrase is that
     %simplephrase elements can go more-or-less anywhere, whereas %phrase
     includes all of the non-structuring elements.  In order that this
     DTD can be used as an XML DTD as well as an SGML one, content
     models which include #PCDATA must be restricted to OR connectors,
     with #PCDATA coming _first_.  This means that the entities
     %phrase and %simpletext must come first in any content models in
     which they appear.

     updates: the original SGML version of para.content had
     (update*,(%phrase)*), so that all updates were neatly clustered
     at the beginning of the content.  This isn't possible in XML, so
     update must be demoted to %structuring, and it can appear anywhere.

     %structuring: larger things, which can appear within a paragraph,
     but which contain more text, or more complication, than the
     phrase markup.  Includes the three different types of lists.

     %maths: the two `display' maths elements, with M in %simplephrase

<!--========== Maths ==========-->
<!-- The M element corresponds to $...$ in TeX.  MEQUATION in text
     corresponds to the equation environment.  MEQNARRAY corresponds to
     the eqnarray environment, but with each line of the alignment
     specified in a MLINE element.  The content of that element should be raw
     LaTeX appropriate to the context, so that the content of MLINE
     within MEQNARRAY should have two & characters in it.

     In principle there are no restrictions on what LaTeX goes in here,
     other than that it be valid, but in practice, I expect that the
     author might need some slight awareness of any restrictions of the
     actual implementation.

     The actual equation number, and the id which allows you to refer to
     it, attach to the MLABEL element, one of which can be freely placed
     within both the MLINE and MEQUATION elements.  This is not as
     attractive, from the DTD point of view, as having the id attached to
     the parent element.  However, that turns out (perfectly
     unexpectedly) to be murder to implement in DSSSL (you have to work
     out the position of the current element in a sequence composed of
     those elements of two element types which have a particular
     attribute present).  The content model which includes MLABEL
     allows arbitrarily many labels in an equation.  This isn't too
     bad, but a model like (#PCDATA, (mlabel, #PCDATA)?) would
     probably be better, but XML has very tight restrictions on mixed
     content.

     Note that I'm declaring this as PCDATA content, accepting the force
     of the overwhelmingly negative discussion of CDATA/RCDATA at
     http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/topics.html#CDATA.  Note also that
     this means that & _is_ interpreted as an entity reference - there's
     a list of ways to get round that in one of the postings at that URL,
     but the simplest seem to be either AT&amp;T or <![cdata[ AT&T ]]>.

     Kimber's 9 March 1998 posting to comp.text.sgml.

     The HyTime shenannigans below says that the element's effective
     content should be the title of the object it points to, or the
     caption in the case of figures and tables.  I'm not going to

<!-- DOCXREF cross-references elements and data within other Starlink
     documents, ie ones which have a number of the format SUN/123, or
     whatever.  Refer to the document using a rflocsrc of this format,
     and further discriminate using an (`exported') ID within that
     document.  I considered using XPointers to refer to IDs or other
     content within that document, but confined it, for the moment,
     just to IDs.  This can be extended in the future to full XPointer
     queries, without invalidating anything which is valid under this
     more restrictive declaration (a bare ID is a valid XPointer
     (check!)).  XLL isn't a solution here, because we don't want to
     be confined to referring to the other document through a URI.
     XPointers should be more generally implemented in future, so this
     notation will fit naturally into a future development of this
     format, into XML, for example.

     This is all more intricate than it might at first appear: see
     HyTime clause 7.8.

     The following is very closely related to the example in HyTime
     note 176, except that the equivalent of LOC there has an
     incorrect value prescription of IDREFS, which is corrected in the
     first TC.  In an earlier version of this (never implemented), the
     DOC attribute had a value prescription of CDATA, and was
     interpreted as a queryloc for a Starlink document.  This might
     seem more straightforward, but I think it's probably less good.
     The current scheme, with the DOC declared as an entity, means
     that we have to predeclare all the entities we might want to
     refer to.  That doesn't seem like a good thing, but it means that
     they can all be declared in one catalogue, specific to a site,
     and that intelligence about where documents are (local or through
     a URL?) can be encoded there, specific to each site where the
     documents are used.

     The link's effective content should be whatever corresponds to
     the title of the object addressed by LOC.
