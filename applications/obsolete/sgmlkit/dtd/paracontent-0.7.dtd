     used as part of either an SGML or an XML DTD.  Part of this
     modification was parameterising the tag-omission specifiers so
     that they could be defined away when used within an XML DTD.  We
     therefore have to define these here, in such a way that this acts
     as an SGML DTD by default, in case they haven't been
     defined already.  This means that this DTD can be used from
     within an SGML DTD without modifying that DTD (eg, the

<!-- also %additional.references: see Feature.Bodycontent.References below -->

<!--========== Element classes ==========-->
<!-- %phrase: different types of phrase display within text.
     distinction between %simplephrase and %phrase is that
     %simplephrase elements can go more-or-less anywhere, whereas %phrase
     includes all of the non-structuring elements.  In order that this
     DTD can be used as an XML DTD as well as an SGML one, content
     models which include #PCDATA must be restricted to OR connectors,
     with #PCDATA coming _first_.  This means that the entities
     %phrase and %simpletext must come first in any content models in
     which they appear.

     updates: the original SGML version of para.content had
     (update*,(%phrase)*), so that all updates were neatly clustered
     at the beginning of the content.  This isn't possible in XML, so
     update must be demoted to %structuring, and it can appear anywhere.

     %structuring: larger things, which can appear within a paragraph,
     but which contain more text, or more complication, than the
     phrase markup.  Includes the three different types of lists.

     %maths: the two `display' maths elements, with M in %simplephrase

     content for things like the abstract and  list items, writable in a

     be treated the same by the application), but is more restrictive,
     and so can be used within NOTEs, for example, without clumsy
     exclusions.  It'll also help find `missing end tag' errors.
     -->

<!-- The Span element is intended to delimit properly nested regions
     in the flow of text.  At present, the only attribute it has is
     the media attribute, but I expect that it will be extended with a
     more general `class' attribute at some point.

     Span has a rather broad content model (%p.model) to allow it to
     contain all the elements which are allowed inside P or PX
     elements.  In order not to break the hierarchy of models, it
     therefore needs to go in the %structuring; parameter entity.

     The media.types are patterned after those in the W3C HTML4 spec.  See
     <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.13> for media
     types, and
     <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/dtd.html#MediaDesc> for the
     declaration of the mediadesc entity there.  The parsing of this
     attribute should be as described in that HTML spec, but at
     present, users should expect only `screen', `print', `tty' and `all' to
     be recognised.

<!--========== Maths ==========-->
<!-- The M element corresponds to $...$ in TeX.  MEQUATION in text
     corresponds to the equation environment.  MEQNARRAY corresponds to
     the eqnarray environment, but with each line of the alignment
     specified in a MLINE element.  The content of that element should be raw
     LaTeX appropriate to the context, so that the content of MLINE
     within MEQNARRAY should have two & characters in it.

     In principle there are no restrictions on what LaTeX goes in here,
     other than that it be valid, but in practice, I expect that the
     author might need some slight awareness of any restrictions of the
     actual implementation.

     The actual equation number, and the id which allows you to refer to
     it, attach to the MLABEL element, one of which can be freely placed
     within both the MLINE and MEQUATION elements.  This is not as
     attractive, from the DTD point of view, as having the id attached to
     the parent element.  However, that turns out (perfectly
     unexpectedly) to be murder to implement in DSSSL (you have to work
     out the position of the current element in a sequence composed of
     those elements of two element types which have a particular
     attribute present).  The content model which includes MLABEL
     allows arbitrarily many labels in an equation.  This isn't too
     bad, but a model like (#PCDATA, (mlabel, #PCDATA)?) would
     probably be better, but XML has very tight restrictions on mixed
     content.

     Note that I'm declaring this as PCDATA content, accepting the force
     of the overwhelmingly negative discussion of CDATA/RCDATA at
     http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/topics.html#CDATA.  Note also that
     this means that & _is_ interpreted as an entity reference - there's
     a list of ways to get round that in one of the postings at that URL,
     but the simplest seem to be either AT&amp;T or <![cdata[ AT&T ]]>.

  * Internal to the document
    Element REF.  Can refer to sections, tables, and possibly
    to paragraphs.

  * To other Starlink documents

  * To URLs
    Element WEBREF: contains self anchor, just like HTML A element.
    Also element URL, containing URL.

     Kimber's 9 March 1998 posting to comp.text.sgml.

     content should be the title of the object it points to, or the
     caption in the case of figures and tables.  I'm not going to

<!-- DOCXREF cross-references elements and data within other Starlink
     documents, ie ones which have a number of the format SUN/123, or
     whatever.  Refer to the document using a rflocsrc of this format,
     and further discriminate using an (`exported') ID within that
     document.  I considered using XPointers to refer to IDs or other
     content within that document, but confined it, for the moment,
     just to IDs.  This can be extended in the future to full XPointer
     queries, without invalidating anything which is valid under this
     more restrictive declaration (a bare ID is a valid XPointer
     (check!)).  XLL isn't a solution here, because we don't want to
     be confined to referring to the other document through a URI.
     XPointers should be more generally implemented in future, so this
     notation will fit naturally into a future development of this
     format, into XML, for example.

     In a project meeting, it was decided that there were substantial
     operational difficulties in guaranteeing that document-summary
     target files would always exist.  Therefore the processing of
     this element was required to work even if the target element
     didn't exist, by parsing the public identifier, and making
     intelligent guesses about the system's environment.  This is very
     messy, and really nothing to do with the DTD, however it seems
     worth noting here that this is a blessed practice, and so that a
     document may be considered `acceptable' even if the link implied
     in this DOCXREF element is broken.

     Initially, the generated link text could be overridden by
     supplying a value for the `text' attribute.  To make this element
     more consistent with the REF element, however, this has been
     changed so that the element's link text is given as content to
     the DOCXREF element.  The `text' attribute is still present and
     supported, for (very temporary) backward compatibility, but
     undocumented.

     This is all more intricate than it might at first appear: see
     HyTime clause 7.8.

     The following is very closely related to the example in HyTime
     note 176, except that the equivalent of LOC there has an
     incorrect value prescription of IDREFS, which is corrected in the
     first TC.  (i) In an earlier version of this (never implemented), the
     DOC attribute had a value prescription of CDATA, and was
     interpreted as a queryloc for a Starlink document.  This might
     seem more straightforward, but I think it's probably less good.
     (ii) The next scheme, with the DOC declared as an entity, meant
     that we had to predeclare all the entities we might want to
     refer to.  That doesn't seem like a good thing, but it means that
     they can all be declared in one catalogue, specific to a site,
     and that intelligence about where documents are (local or through
     a URL?) can be encoded there, specific to each site where the
     documents are used. (iii) The final, current, scheme reverts to
     the DOC attribute having a CDATA type, but is simpler than the
     queryloc method: if this is the name of an entity, then that must
     be an SGML file with a notation of 'documentsummary' or 'xml',
     and this is parsed as described above; if it is not an entity,
     but just a string, then it must be a document spec like
     'SUN/123', and this is handled as with the 'broken' pubid above.
     This is least elegant, but it's probably robust enough, and works
     well in the XML world.

     The link's effective content should be whatever corresponds to
     the title of the object addressed by LOC.
