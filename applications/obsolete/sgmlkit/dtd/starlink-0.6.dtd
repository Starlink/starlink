<![ IGNORE [
  This is the Starlink General DTD.  It should not be used
  independently, but invoked from another DTD via:

    <!ENTITY % Starlink.general
	PUBLIC "-//Starlink//DTD Starlink General 0.6//EN">
    %Starlink.general;

  The DTD should define the following parameter entities:

    DocClass       : as SUN, SGP, etc
    req.abstract   : see below
    DTD.Version    : version of the calling DTD

  Defaults for these (except DTD.Version) are given below.

  Certain entities have both a public and a system identifier -- the
  latter is a URL derived from the pubid.  This string is maintained
  by the sed script add-sysids.sed, which demands that the sysid is a
  string, alone on a line immediately following a line which includes
  the string `PUBLIC'.

     These are kept in a separate file, because one of the notations (at
     present) defines data attributes (see 8879, Sect. 11.4).  If we want
     to define, in the DTD subset, entities which use any of these
     attributes, the notation declaration must come first (see
     Sect. 11.4.1.2, whereas notation definitions can be used before they
     are defined (Sect. 11.4.1.1)).  We can arrange this by explicitly
     reading in the notation declarations in the DTD subset using the
     formula below.  This is certainly a bit clunky, but clear.

     The title element deliberately has a rather simple content model

     in contexts remote from the General DTD (such as the DocumentSummary,
     or HTML TITLE elements, or some cavern in this search engine we keep
     talking about), so any markup in there would have to be reprocessed
     (which would typically mean stripped) every time it's transformed.
     This element is therefore defined with a model which is such that
     simply stripping the markup from the TITLE content would be a
     reasonable `transformation': this is a restriction the document
     author might need to be aware of, so this should be documented.

     As a companion to this, the DISPLAYTITLE element has a full content
     model, and is intended to be used as a presentation title.

     Presence or absence of abstract is controlled by definition of

     we could have `(sect+ | part+)?', and include either a sequence
     of SECTs or a sequence of PARTs, but I don't see the need for
     this extra complication right now.

     As for appendices, I considered <!ELEMENT appendix - O (...)> with
     the same content model as for SECT, but this way (with <!ELEMENT
     appendices - O (sect+)> ) we have the same structure within
     appendices as outside, and it seems simply neater.  The only
     drawback is that we no longer have `<appendix>appendix title'
     reminding us we're in an appendix, and searching for something in an
     appendix's title (within an SGML aware search engine, for example)
     will need a further level of qualification.  But these both seem
     disposable.

     http://www.oasis-open.org/html/a503.htm for discussion, and
     http://www.oasis-open.org/html/publtext.htm for public texts),
     which this DTD originally used.  There are no differences between
     the two which are significant to us.

     The Exchange Table Model can be customised.  Adjust the table entry
     model, and remove the %titles entity

     Also rename the table element to `tabular'.  This fits in well with
     the LaTeX model folk will be familiar with, and allows us to
     separate the floating plus captioning plus ID stuff from the
     lining-it-up-in-columns of tabular layouts.

<!-- The FIGURE element contains a sequence of _alternatives_ for the
     figure's content.  The application may choose any one of these
     alternatives as the effective content of the figure.  If there are
     none it can use, it should fail gracefully, but the way in which it
     fails is not defined here.

     The FIGURECONTENT element contains content in a specified notation.
     Text notations for figures (ie, notations using character data as
     opposed to non-SGML data, as described in 8879, B.13) may be
     included directly within the element.  Alternatively, and
     necessarily if the notation is a non-text format, the content of the
     element may be specified in an external entity.  It would be good
     practice for such an entity declaration to hava a data content
     notation (8879, 10.6.5) (for example <!ENTITY figure.test system
     "file.eps" ndata eps>); the implementation should warn if the
     (required) notation on the element conflicts with that for the
     entity, but should let the latter prevail.

     The figurecontent element may be followed by one or more paragraphs.
     These should collectively be taken to be a single further
     alternative (though typically, such an alternative will be the only
     one proffered).

     At some point, I should make a HyTime declaration of the
     transclusion element FIGURECONTENT.
