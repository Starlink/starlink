SGML entities
-------------

I ftp'd these entities from the SGML repository at
ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/SGML/ENTITIES/, then renamed them to *.sdata,
then formed the catalog from  

  for i in *;\
  do \
  sed -n -e "/\"ISO/s/^.*\"\(.*\)\".*$/PUBLIC '\1' $i/p" $i >>catalog;\
  done

(this missed ISOamsn.sdata!)

I added three other versions of the ISOlat1 entity set, with different
`public text display versions', in ISOlat1-{html,latex,ent}.ent

See notes on entities at http://www.sil.org/sgml/topics.html#entities


XML entities
------------

The XML versions of the entities are lifted from the DocBk
distribution, at http://nwalsh.com/docbook/xml/index.html
