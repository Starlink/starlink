#  Description:
#     This command displays a hypertext version of the CCDPACK
#     documentation in a Mosaic or netscape browser. If either of
#     these browsers are already running then they are used to
#     display the document, otherwise a new browser is started.

#        Command to start browser. This is optional and defaults to "Netscape".

#  Usage:

#     If the variable HTX_BROWSER is set then this will be used as the
#     browser name, unless overridden by a command line name.

#  History:
#     7-JUN-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Original version.
#     12-JUL-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Updated to work as Rodney Warren-Smith's showme (converted to
#        bourne and uses HTX_BROWSER variable).
#     14-AUG-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Added kill -0 as detection command (was 
#           tail=`echo ${HTX_BROWSER} | sed 's:/.*/::'`
#           exists=`ps -p ${pid} | grep ${tail} | wc -l`
#        ).
#        Added information output (bit mysterious before this).
#     9-OCT-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Now used by CCDPACK.
#     22-JUL-2003 (MBT):
#        Fixed to work with Mozilla, and have a go with other browsers.
