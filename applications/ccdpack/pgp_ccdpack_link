#  Name:
#     pgp_ccdpack_link

#  Purpose:
#     Link against CCDPACK, plotting and CNF RTL libraries.

#  Language:
#     Bourne Shell

#  Description:
#     This invokes ccdpack_link_adam with one of the flags '-pgp' or 
#     '-pgplot' (GKS or native PGPLOT respectively).  It's necessary
#     because automake won't allow you to invoke a link script 
#     with a flag (doesn't like spaces).
