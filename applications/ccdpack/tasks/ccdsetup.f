      SUBROUTINE CCDSETUP( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCDSETUP

*  Purpose:
*     Sets the CCDPACK global parameters.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCDSETUP( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     CCDSETUP sets the values of a sequence of global parameters to be
*     used within CCDPACK. The values of these parameters, when set,
*     will override those of any others, except values entered on the
*     command line. This routine should be used before starting a
*     CCDPACK reduction sequence. The parameters are primarily
*     concerned with values to do with the CCD device characteristics,
*     items such as:
*
*       - The ADC factor which converts the ADUs of the input data
*         frames into detected electrons, for which Poissonian
*         statistics are valid
*       - The bias strip placements
*       - The readout direction
*       - The typical readout noise
*       - The useful CCD area
*       - The definition of the BAD areas of the chip
*
*     The routine also initialises the CCDPACK logging system.
*
*     All parameters may be returned as ! (the parameter-system null
*     value) this indicates that the current value is to be left
*     unchanged if one exists (this will be shown as the default and
*     can also be accepted by pressing return) or that a value is not
*     to be assigned for this global parameter. If a value is not
*     assigned it will be defaulted or prompted as appropriate when
*     other CCDPACK applications are run.
*
*     The removal of global parameters is performed by the CCDCLEAR
*     application.

*  Usage:
*     ccdsetup logto=? logfile=? adc=? bounds=? rnoise=? mask=?
*              direction=? deferred=? extent=? preserve=? genvar=?
*              ndfnames=?

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ADC = _DOUBLE (Read and Write)
*        The Analogue-to-Digital units Conversion factor (ADC). CCD
*        readout values are usually given in Analogue-to-Digital Units
*        (ADUs). The ADC factor is the value which converts ADUs back
*        to the number of electrons which were present in each pixel in
*        the CCD after the integration had finished. This value is
*        required to allow proper estimates of the inherent noise
*        associated with each readout value. CCDPACK makes these
*        estimates and stores them in the variance component of the
*        final NDFs. Not supplying a value for this parameter may be a
*        valid response if variances are not to be generated by DEBIAS.
*        [!]
*     BOUNDS( 2 or 4 ) = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
*        The bounds of the bias strips of the CCD. These should be in
*        pixel indices (see notes) and be given in pairs up to a limit
*        of 2. The sense of the bounds is along the readout direction.
*        For example, 2,16,400,416 means that the bias strips are
*        located between pixels 2 to 16 and 400 to 416 inclusive along
*        the readout direction. The bias strips are used to either
*        offset the bias frame or as an estimate of the bias which is to
*        be interpolated across the frame in some way (see DEBIAS). Not
*        supplying values for this parameter may be a valid response if
*        the bias frame is to be directly subtracted from the data
*        without offsetting.
*        [!]
*     DEFERRED = _DOUBLE (Read and Write)
*        The deferred charge value. Often known as the "fat" or "skinny"
*        zero (just for confusion). This is actually the charge which is
*        not transferred from a CCD pixel when the device is read out.
*        Usually this is zero or negligible and is only included for
*        completeness and for processing very old data.
*        [!]
*     DIRECTION = LITERAL (Read and Write)
*        The readout direction of the CCD. This may take the values X
*        or Y.  A value of X indicates that the readout direction is
*        along the first (horizontal) direction, an Y indicates that
*        the readout direction is along the direction perpendicular to
*        the X axis. If this value is not supplied then it will be
*        defaulted to X by DEBIAS.
*        [!]
*     EXTENT( 4 ) = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
*        The extent of the useful CCD area in pixel indices (see notes).
*        The extent is defined as a range in X values and a range in Y
*        values (XMIN,XMAX,YMIN,YMAX). These define a section of an NDF
*        (SUN/33). Any parts of the CCD outside of this area will not
*        be present in the final output. This is useful for excluding
*        bias strips, badly vignetted parts etc.
*        [!]
*     GENVAR = _LOGICAL (Read and Write)
*        The value of this parameter controls whether or not variance
*        estimates will be generated within CCDPACK. A value of TRUE
*        indicates that the routines MAKEBIAS and DEBIAS should generate
*        variances. A value of FALSE inhibits variance generation.
*        Normally variances should be generated, even though disk and
*        process-time savings can be made by their omission.
*        [TRUE]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read and Write)
*        Name of the CCDPACK logfile.  If a null (!) value is given for
*        this parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of
*        the value of the LOGTO parameter.
*        [CCDPACK.LOG]
*     LOGTO = LITERAL (Read and Write)
*        Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output
*        for future reference as well as for display on the terminal.
*        This parameter controls this process, and may be set to any
*        unique abbreviation of the following:
*           -  TERMINAL  -- Send output to the terminal only
*           -  LOGFILE   -- Send output to the logfile only (see the
*                           LOGFILE parameter)
*           -  BOTH      -- Send output to both the terminal and the
*                           logfile
*           -  NEITHER   -- Produce no output at all
*        [BOTH]
*     MASK = LITERAL (Read and Write)
*        This parameter allows you to supply information about the
*        presence of defective parts of your data (such as bad lines,
*        columns, hot spots etc.). You can supply this information in
*        two basic forms.
*
*          - By giving the name of an NDF that has the areas which are
*            to be masked set BAD or to a suitable quality value
*            (see DEBIAS). This can be achieved by displaying a typical
*            NDF using KAPPA, getting logs of the positions of an outline
*            enclosing the BAD area and using the KAPPA application
*            SEGMENT, by using the ZAPLIN facility or by using the ARDGEN
*            application together with ARDMASK (but see the next option
*            instead).
*
*          - By giving the name of an ordinary text file that contains an
*            ARD (ASCII Region Definition) description. ARD is a textual
*            language for describing regions of a data array. The
*            language is based on a set of keywords that identify simple
*            shapes (such as Column, Row, Line, Box and Circle).  ARD
*            files can be generated by the KAPPA application ARDGEN, or
*            can be created by hand. A description of ARD is given in
*            the section "ASCII region definition files" in the DEBIAS
*            help.
*
*        If no mask file is available simply return an !
*
*        [!]
*     NDFNAMES = _LOGICAL (Read and Write)
*        The value of this parameter controls whether or not position
*        list processing applications are expected to find the names of
*        lists via association with NDFs or not.
*
*        When position lists (which are just text files of positions
*        with either an index, an X and a Y value, or or just X and Y
*        values) are used the option exists to associate them with a
*        particular NDF. This is achieved by entering the name of the
*        position list file into an NDF's CCDPACK extension under the
*        item "CURRENT_LIST". Associating position lists with NDFs has
*        the advantage of allowing wildcards to be used for the input
*        names and makes sure that positions are always used in the
*        correct context (this is particularly useful when determining
*        inter-NDF transformations).
*        [TRUE]
*     PRESERVE = _LOGICAL (Read and Write)
*        The value of this parameter controls whether or not processed
*        NDF data arrays retain their input data types. If it is set
*        TRUE then CCDPACK applications will return and process any
*        data in the input type. If it is set FALSE then the
*        applications will output an NDF whose type is determined by
*        which data type was considered necessary to allow processing
*        of the input data. This will usually mean an output type of
*        _REAL (all types not _INTEGER or _DOUBLE) or _DOUBLE (when
*        input types are _INTEGER or _DOUBLE). This option should be
*        used when a unacceptable loss of accuracy may occur, or when
*        the data range can no longer be represented in the range of
*        the present data type. The latter effect may occur when
*        expanding input ADU values into electrons in DEBIAS, if the
*        ADC factor is large and the input data has a type of _WORD.
*        [TRUE]
*     RESTORE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether or not you want to restore the values of the program
*        parameters from a "restoration" file. If TRUE then you'll
*        need to specify the name of the file using the RESTOREFILE
*        parameter. A description of the contents of restoration files is
*        given in the notes section.
*        [FALSE]
*     RESTOREFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        This parameter is only used if the RESTORE parameters is TRUE.
*        It allows you to give the name of the restoration file to be used
*        when restoring the program parameters. Restoration files are
*        described in the notes section.
*        [CCDPACK_SETUP.DAT]
*     RNOISE = _DOUBLE (Read and Write)
*        The nominal readout noise (in ADUs) for the current CCD.
*        Estimates of the readout noise are made by the routines
*        MAKEFLAT and DEBIAS. These can be used to estimate the
*        validity of this value. Not supplying a value for this
*        parameter may be a valid response if variances are not to be
*        generated by MAKEBIAS and/or DEBIAS.
*        [!]
*     SATURATE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls whether the data are to be processed to
*        detect saturated values or not. The actual saturation value is
*        given using the SATURATION parameter.
*        [FALSE]
*     SATURATION = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The data saturation value. Only used if SATURATE is TRUE.
*        [1.0D6]
*     SETSAT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter controls how saturated data will be flagged for
*        identification by later programs. If it is set TRUE then saturated 
*        values will be replaced by the value of the parameter SATURATION 
*        (which is also the value used to detect saturated data). If it is 
*        FALSE then saturated values will be set to BAD (also known as 
*        invalid).
*        [FALSE]
*     SAVE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Whether or not to save the values of the program parameters to a
*        "restoration" file. If TRUE then you'll need to specify the name
*        of the file using the SAVEFILE parameter. A description of the
*        contents of restoration files is given in the notes section.
*        [FALSE]
*     SAVEFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        This parameter is only used if the SAVE parameters is TRUE.
*        It allows you to give the name of the restoration file to be used
*        when restoring the program parameters. Restoration files are
*        described in the notes section.
*        [CCDPACK_SETUP.DAT]

*  Notes:
*     - Pixel indices. The bounds supplied to DEBIAS should be given as
*       pixel indices. These usually start at 1,1 for the pixel at the
*       lower left-hand corner of the data array component (this may
*       be not true if the NDFs have been sectioned, in which case the
*       lower left hand pixel will have pixel indices equal to the data
*       component origin values). Pixel indices are different from
*       pixel coordinates in that they are non-continuous, i.e. can
*       only have integer values, and start at 1,1 not 0,0. To change
*       pixel coordinates to pixel indices add 0.5 and round to the
*       nearest integer.
*
*     - Restoration files. CCDSETUP has the ability to store and restore
*       its parameter values from a description stored in a text file.
*       This is intended for use in retaining a particular instrumental
*       setups for long periods of time (so that it is easy to create a
*       database of common setups). The format of these files is very
*       simple and consists of lines containing "keyword=value"
*       descriptions. Where "keyword" is the name of the CCDSETUP
*       parameter and "value" its value. Comments can be included using
*       the character "#" at the start of a line or an "!" inline.
*       Continuation lines are indicated by a "-" as the last character.
*       An example of the contents of a restoration file is shown next
*       (this is an actual file created by CCDSETUP).
