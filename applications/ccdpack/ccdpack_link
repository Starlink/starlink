#  Name:
#     ccdpack_link

#  Purpose:
#     Link a standalone binary with the CCDPACK libraries.

#  Language:
#     {routine_language}

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script is invoked to print on standard output all the arguments
#     required for a compilation command.  By default
#     no graphics capability is provided, but if one of the flags
#     '-pgp' or '-pgplot' is given, then Starlink or Native PGPLOT
#     graphics will be linked in.

#  History:
#     11-JAN-2001 (MBT):
#        Rewrote combining ccdpack_link_adam and 
#        ccdpack_graphics_link_adam into the same script, and added
#        flags for graphics system selection.
#     29-AUG-2004 (TIMJ):
#        Use one_link
#     10-JUL-2009 (TIMJ):
#        Add kaplibs. Do not include graphics components.
