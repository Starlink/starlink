<P>
 ECHOMOP is primarily orientated to processing single-frame
 observations.  Facilities exist in the Starlink Software Collection
 for the combining of multiple spectra obtained from the reduction
 of a set of data frames.  ECHOMOP does however provide assistance
 for situations where the data frames are well registered, removing
 the necessity for steps such as Order location, tracing, and
 profiling, to be performed for each frame.  The 'clone' option
 allows the selective copying of sections of a previous reduction
 file, which then becomes the baseline for the reduction of another
 similar frame.  Optionally the definition file itself can be
 altered to permit the extension of the reduction file
 structure to include multiple spectra from a single observed
 source (See 'Redefining Object paths' for an example of this).
