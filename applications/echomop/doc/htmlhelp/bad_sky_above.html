<P>
 The program was unable to obtain a satisfactory estimate of the
 position of the 'sky' in the region above the object.
<P>
 The algorithm for determining the sky extent uses the median
 intensity across the profile, and the relative peak intensity.
 The relative peak intensity is multiplied by a the value of the
 parameter TUNE_SKYHILIM and compared with 1.05 times the median
 intensity.  The lower of the two values is used as a threshold.
 When the intensity falls below this threshold, the program denotes
 the pixels from the current pixel to the edge of the dekker as 'sky'.
<P>
 TUNE_SKYHILIM may be varied to adjust the threshold.  It is  also 
 possible to manually adjust the status of each pixel in the profile 
 by setting PFL_INTERACT=Y.
