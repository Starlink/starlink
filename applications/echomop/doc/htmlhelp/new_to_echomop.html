<HR><H2>New to ECHOMOP</H2><HR>
<P>
 ECHOMOP may be used in a variety of ways depending upon your
 expertise.
<P>
 The most convenient method for the first-time user is to start
 ECHOMOP with a menu interface (command echmenu).  This provides a
 guided path through the processes in a standard reduction.
<P>
 echmenu is the monolith program which drives all the other programs
 in the package.  echmenu will always provide a default for the next 
 task to be performed, and this will usually be the correct one for 
 a 'standard' reduction.  To accept the recommended next step,
 it is only necessary to hit Y/return/.
<P>
 The package uses a disk-based 'reduction file' to pass objects
 between its various component tasks.  You will be asked to provide 
 a name for this file, which will be created in the current directory. 
 This file is  permanently associated with a particular set of data 
 frames (object, arc, flat etc.) thereby providing the ability to 
 replay any aspect of the reduction at a later date.  Reduction files 
 can occupy a large amount of disk space however, and you may wish to 
 delete them as soon as the reduced spectrum has been obtained.
<P>
 To start ECHOMOP using a guided menu type:
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
    % echmenu/return/
</PRE>
<P>
 at the command-line prompt.
<P>
 To run any particular ECHOMOP command just type its name at the
 command line prompt.
<P>
 For example:
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
    % ech_locate/return/
</PRE>
<P>
 would run the order location task ech_locate.
