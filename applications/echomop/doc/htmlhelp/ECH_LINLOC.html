<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>
 This option is used to locate arc-line features for later
 identification.
<P>
 It consists of two steps:
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
    9.1  Determine the average arc-line FWHM.
         A typical interactive plot appears below.

         <IMG SRC=fwhm.gif>
<P>
    9.2  Locate all possible arc lines.
</PRE>
<P>
 The FWHM is evaluated by co-adding all possible line features
 in the arc frame, and then averaging the resulting profile, and
 calculating its FWHM.  The value is used to scale the Gaussians
 which are fitted to each arc line in order to obtain an estimate
 of its centre position in X.
<P>
 Possible arc lines are denoted by any region of an order in which
 5 consecutive pixels (P1-5) obey the following relation:
<P>
<PRE WIDTH=72>
    P1 less than P2 less than P3 greater than P4 greater than P5
</PRE>
<P>
 and are amenable to a Gaussian fit with the FWHM calculated.
<P>
 This ensures that even very faint features are put forward for
 possible identification (useful when there are no bright lines
 in an entire order).
