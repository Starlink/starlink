<H2>Usage</H2>
<H3>TUNE_SKYLTHR=_REAL</H3>
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
 Specifies the threshold level for the treatment of sky-line
 candidates in the wavelength-dependent sky model produced when
 TUNE_SKYXPLY is greater than zero.
<P>
 In this case, any pixel whose intensity differs from the fit by 
 more than TUNE_SKYLTHR * fit-sigma will be treated as a sky-line
 candidate, and its actual intensity entered into the model in place
 of the prediction.  The same procedure is also applied to the
 pixels TUNE_SKYLINW nearest neighbours to ensure that the entire
 sky line is entered into the model even when its wings are within
 the sigma constraint described above.
<P>
 INITIAL SUGGESTED VALUE: 3.0.
