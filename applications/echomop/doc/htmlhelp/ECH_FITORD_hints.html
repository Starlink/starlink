<P>
 This routine should be used manually on single orders when they are
 clearly not correctly fitted.  This will usually be seen by viewing
 the paths of the fitted order traces using ech_trplt.  In many cases
 it will be possible to get a good trace fit by clipping a set of
 obviously bad samples, and re-fitting (perhaps with a lower degree
 of polynomial).
<P>
 The other main option for coping with such problems is to rely on
 the trace consistency checking routine.  This will produce a good
 set of consistent trace fits in most cases.
<P>
 If a particular order is beyond recovery and you do not wish to
 extract it at all, then it may be disabled by clipping away all of
 its trace samples with this routine.
