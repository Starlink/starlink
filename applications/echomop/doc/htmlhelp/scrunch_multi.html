<P>
 This utility option is provided to assist in co-adding spectra
 from many frames.  This option assumes that the first frame in
 the reduction has been scrunched with the required wavelength scale.
<P>
 It then reads a list of additional reduction structure file names
 from an ASCII file called NAMES.LIS.  The extracted spectra from each
 of these reduction files is then scrunched to the same scale and
 co-added into the scrunched spectra in the current reduction file.
<P>
 The type of weighting during addition is controlled using the
 parameter TUNE_MRGWGHT.
