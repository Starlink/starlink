<P>
<H2>Function</H2>
This routine performs the determination of dekker extent
           (using arc or flat field).
<P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
 Profiles are currently averaged over all orders.  The routine will
 automatically determine both the dekker limits and for decent data
 these automatically set values will be correct.  If they are not, or
 if a particular Dekker configuration is needed; options are
 provided to interactively edit the allocation of lower/upper limits
 (order-by-order).
<P>
 Options are selected from a menu by striking single characters, the
 carriage return is not required.  The following options are available
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
 E(Exit), leaves the profiling routine.
<P>
<LI>
 L(Lower dekker), sets the lower dekker-limit to the current X-position
 of the graphics cursor.
<P>
<LI>
 U(Upper dekker), sets the upper dekker-limit to the current X-position
 of the graphics cursor.
<P>
<LI>
 R(Replot mode toggle), toggles the way in which re-plots are performed
 after a pixels status has been edited.  For some devices it is
 necessary to replot the entire graph, as graphics can not be switched
 back on once they have been erased.  Other devices may support changing
 a display pixel state without re-plotting the whole screen.  In this
 case, it is much quicker to replot only the part of the graph which
 has actually changed.  Typing R toggles between these two modes of
 operation.
<P>
<LI>
 +(Plus key), changes the selected order.  The default is to edit all
 orders at once, thus all orders will have the same sky/object pixel
 allocations (in spatial dimension).  But, in some cases it may be
 advantageous to specify object pixels on an order-by-order basis.
<P>
 Typing Plus from the All order situation will cause the first order
 only to be selected.  In single order editing, the Plus key selects
 the next order, except when the highest numbered order is the current
 one, in which case it causes processing to revert to all order editing.
<P>
<LI>
 -(Minus key), changes the selected order.  As above except that the
 order currently selected is decremented.  Using the Minus key when
 order 1 is selected  will revert to the all order editing situation.
</UL>
A typical interactive plot appears below.
