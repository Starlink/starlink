<H2>Usage</H2>
<H3>TRC_VETO=_LOGICAL</H3>
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
 Set to YES if the order consistency is to be checked interactively.
 Automatic checking is performed otherwise.
<P>
 When automatic checking is engaged there are two parameters which
 may be adjusted to optimise the performance of the program.
<P>
 These are TUNE_CLPMXDEV which defines the clipping point, and
 TUNE_CLPBY which is the number of points to clip in each iteration.
<P>
 When TRC_VETO is set, the option to reject a re-fitted order at
 each iteration is available.
<P>
 It is strongly recommended that this option is not used until you
 have a clear understanding of the algorithm used by the consistency
 checker, as it is possible to 'drive' the fit off by injudicious
 rejection of the re-fits proposed by the program.
