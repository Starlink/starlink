<P>
 ECHOMOP has special facilities for particular detector-dependent
 problems.  In particular, for CCDs and similar detectors, the data
 may become obscured by cosmic-ray events over a long exposure.
 The package provides 2 methods of identifying and flagging such
 pixels.
<P>
 CCDs also necessitate the provision of a number of extra pieces
 of information to the reduction process.  Care must be taken to
 ensure these values are accurate as they can have a severe impact
 upon the resultant spectrum.
<P>
 For the IPCS detector, the frames can be highly distorted in
 both X- and Y-directions.  The package provides for a detailed
 2-D polynomial fit to be made to the distortions present in
 each order.
