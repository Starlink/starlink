<HR><H2>Flux Calibration</H2><HR>
<P>
 This release of ECHOMOP provides no special support for flux
 calibration of the extracted spectra.  FIGARO provides extensive
 support for this procedure, including many standard star data
 tables.
<P>
 It should be noted that due to the extremely high resolution of
 the spectra produced by UCLES, there are unlikely to be sufficiently
 high resolution data available for the flux standards.
<P>
 A common situation is that the FIGARO table for the standard
 contains (at most) one sample (flux) point per order, and that such
 points are often 40 Angstrom averages.  In such cases it is
 difficult to ascribe much confidence to the resulting fluxes.
<P>
 A program of high-resolution observations (of commonly used flux
 standards) to combat this problem is being planned.
<P>
 Output ECHOMOP data files (generated using ech_result) may be read
 into the appropriate FIGARO tasks.
