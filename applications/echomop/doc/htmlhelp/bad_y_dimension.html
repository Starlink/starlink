<P>
 A data frame has been specified whose Y-dimension is different from
 that of the first frame specified during the reduction.
<P>
 All frames must have the same X- and Y-dimensions.  The most likely
 cause is that the frames are from different datasets.  If you really
 want to use this combination of data frames then you must use the
 facilities of FIGARO to 'grow' one of the data frames up to the
 dimensions of the other.  You must ensure that any image registration
 problems are taken care of before reduction is attempted.  In general,
 it will be necessary to re-start the reduction with a new reduction
 file after any such adjustments have been made.
