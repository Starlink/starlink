#  Name:
#     htxfinder

#  Type of Module:
#     CGI compliant shell script.

#  Invocation:
#     By CGI compliant HTTP server.

#  Description:
#     This is a CGI script for performing keyword searches on the Starlink
#     documentation set. It makes use of the HTX "findme" command (SUN/188)
#     to perform the search.
#
#     If accessed directly by a client, this script outputs an HTML search form
#     into which the keyword and search options may be entered. When the form
#     is submitted, the resulting request is returned to this script, which
#     then detects that the form contents are to be handled. It decodes these
#     contents, performs the document search, and outputs an HTML document
#     containing the search results. These results will normally include a link
#     to each of the documents found.

#  Installation and Configuration:
#     This script should be installed with appropriate protections in the
#     directory that holds your HTTP server's CGI scripts. Note that it will
#     also execute the "findme" script that forms part of the standard HTX
#     installation, so this must be available with appropriate protections,
#     and should also be secure (see below).
#
#     This script may require editing to configure it for your system, as
#     follows:
#
#    STARLINK='/web/star'
#        Edit and un-comment the line above to define the directory under which
#        your HTX installation resides (normally this will be the directory
#        where you have installed the rest of your Starlink software). This
#        script will execute HTX scripts which it finds in the directory:
#
#           $STARLINK/bin
#
#        and its subdirectories. In the interests of security, this directory,
#        those above it, and the HTX installation itself should only be
#        writable by trusted individuals. The default value used is:
#
#           "/star"
#
#        if you do not specify STARLINK explicitly above.
#
HTX_PATH='/star/docs:/star/help'
#HTX_PATH='/star/docs:/star/help'
#        Edit and un-comment the line above to define a colon-separated list
#        of the directories (i.e. document libraries) in which to search for
#        documents. The default value used is:
#
#           "/star/docs:/star/help"
#
#        if you do not specify HTX_PATH explicitly above.
#
#HTX_URLSED='%star/docs/%docs/%'
#        The output from findme does not always reflect the positions of
#        files as seen by the web server. Adjust this pattern to correct
#        the output of findme.
#
#     HTX_SUPPORT=''
#        Edit and un-comment the line above to contain text (which may include
#        HTML constructs) which identifies the person to contact for help with
#        problems originating with this script or the documents it searches.
#        This will appear at the end of any output sent to the client. The
#        default behaviour is to omit this information if you do not specify
#        HTX_SUPPORT explicitly above (unless this script is running on the
#        Starlink WWW server at RAL, in which case a suitable default is
#        supplied).
#
#     echo 'Content-type: text/plain'
#     echo htxfinder
#        Un-comment the previous two lines to receive debugging information
#        at the client side.
#
#     No edits apart from those above should normally be needed.

#  Input:
#     The script uses the standard CGI environment variables for input and also
#     reads the returned form contents (a "POST" request) from standard input.

#  Implementation Deficiencies:
#     The correct operation of this script depends on there being links in
#     your HTTP server directory such that the names of documents found locally
#     by the "findme" command (which will start with one of the directory names
#     given in the HTX_PATH list) can also be interpreted by the HTTP server.
#     If this is not done, the search may succeed, but the client will not be
#     able to follow links from the output back to the matched documents. This
#     is because these links must go via your HTTP server, which only sees a
#     "virtual" file system based on the contents of your server directory.

#     4-MAR-1997 (RFWS):
#        Buffer script output to prevent the user thinking it has stalled.
#        Fix problem with trailing space on keyword if no buttons checked.
#        Change default information searched to omit lines of text.
#     6-NOV-1997 (RFWS):
