#  Name:
#     htxserver

#  Type of Module:
#     CGI compliant shell script.

#  Invocation:
#     By CGI compliant HTTP server.

#  Description:
#     This is a CGI script for serving hypertext documents that have index
#     files generated by the HTX "hlink" hypertext linker command. It is used
#     when accessing such documents from remote sites, as local access to
#     linked documents can be done directly and does not need to go via a
#     server.
#
#     The purpose of using this script is, roughly, to perform the resolution
#     of document cross-references in the same way as "hlink" does (i.e. by
#     looking up cross-reference labels in an index file to identify which
#     part of a multi-page document is required). In this case, the lookup is
#     performed in real time when the cross-reference is actually followed.
#
#     If this script succeeds in resolving the cross-reference, it returns a
#     URL which the client can then use to access the required part of the
#     document. If it fails, it returns an HTML document containing information
#     about why it failed. This may also contain links to other parts of the
#     document which could still be useful to the remote user.
#
#     Documents are searched for in a series of directories identifid by the
#     HTX_LOCATIONS variable (see the "Installation and Configuration"
#     section). Each set of ".html" files comprising a hypertext document
#     should reside in their own directory (within one of the directories
#     above) with a name of the form:
#
#        docname.htx
#
#     and should be accompanied by the "docname.index" file, as generated by
#     "hlink".
#
#     If the required hypertext ".htx" document cannot be found in any of the
#     locations specified, this script will then examine the contents of the
#     HTX catalogue file (if any) in each location to see if the document is
#     available in non-hypertext form (see SUN/188 for a description of HTX
#     catalogue files). If found, the URL of the document file (as listed in
#     the HTX catalogue file) is returned. This approach assumes that the
#     client has access to an appropriate document viewer for the file in
#     question.

#  Installation and Configuration:
#     This script should be installed with appropriate protections in the
#     directory that holds your HTTP server's CGI scripts. Note that it will
#     also execute scripts that form part of the standard HTX installation, so
#     these must be available with appropriate protections, and should also be
#     secure (see below).
#
#     This script may require editing to configure it for your system, as
#     follows:
#
STARLINK='/star'
#        Edit and un-comment the line above to define the directory under which
#        your HTX installation resides (normally this will be the directory
#        where you have installed the rest of your Starlink software). This
#        script will execute HTX scripts which it finds in the directory:
#
#           $STARLINK/bin/htx-scripts
#
#        In the interests of security, this directory and all directories
#        above it should only be writable by trusted individuals. The default
#        value used is:
#
#           "/star"
#
#        if you do not specify STARLINK explicitly above.
#
HTX_LOCATIONS='star/docs=/star/docs:star/help=/star/help'
#        Edit and un-comment the line above to define a colon-separated list
#        of locations to search for the documents to be served, of the form:
#     
#           "loc=dir:loc=dir:loc=dir"
#
#        where "loc" is the location of a directory containing documents, as
#        known to your HTTP server (i.e. given relative to the server's
#        document root directory or using a pre-defined server alias) and "dir"
#        is the true file system path of the directory. All the directories
#        used, and the documents they contain, must be readable by the server
#        and may have to reside in specific locations, depending on how your
#        server is configured. The default value used is:
#
#           "star/docs=/star/docs:star/help=/star/help"
#
#        if you do not specify HTX_LOCATIONS explicitly above.
#
#     HTX_SUPPORT=''
#        Edit and un-comment the line above to contain text (which may include
#        HTML constructs) which identifies the person to contact for help with
#        problems originating with this script or the documents it serves. This
#        will appear at the end of any error messages sent to the client. The
#        default behaviour is to omit this information if you do not specify
#        HTX_SUPPORT explicitly above (unless this script is running on the
#        Starlink WWW server at RAL, in which case a suitable default is
#        supplied).
#
#     echo 'Content-type: text/plain'
#     echo
#        Un-comment the previous two lines to receive debugging information
#        at the client side.
#
#     No edits apart from those above should normally be needed.

#  Input:
#     The script uses the standard CGI environment variables for input. The
#     following have particular significance:
#
#     PATH_INFO
#        Will contain the virtual document path as extracted from the URL
#        by the HTTP server. This script expects it to be of the form:
#
#           /xxx/docname.htx/yyy.html
#
#        where "/xxx" may be any directory path (including a null path) and
#        "yyy.html" may be any path to an ".html" file, which need not
#        necessarily exist (this may also be null).
#     QUERY_STRING
#        This should contain the optional label part of the cross-reference
#        and this script expects it to have the form:
#
#           xref_label
#
#        If the label is absent, then QUERY_STRING may either be blank or set
#        to "xref_".
#
#     Note that these requirements mean that the URL passed to the HTTP server
#     running this script should normally be of the form:
#
#        <script_url>/xxx/docname.htx/yyy.html?xref_label
#
#     where <script_url> locates this CGI script and "/xxx", "yyy.html" and
#     "label" (or "xref_label") are optional.

#  Examples:
#     A typical URL that could be used to follow a cross-reference to a
#     remote document using this script might look like:
#
#        http://www.stalink.ac.uk/cgi-bin
#                       /htxserver/sun109.htx/node33.html?xref_appendix
#
#     (this is broken across two lines for clarity and should all be one
#     string). If successful, the script would return a "Location: URL" string
#     that allows the client to access that part of document "sun109" that
#     is identified by the "appendix" cross-reference label.

#  History:
#     9-MAR-1995 (PDRAPER):
#        Original version.
#     27-APR-1995 (RFWS):
#        Greatly revised to include HTML diagnostics and to use the same style
#        as other HTX scripts. Also extended to use a search path for documents
#        and to look harder for substitute files if the cross-reference cannot
#        be properly resolved.
#     28-APR-1995 (RFWS):
#        Added the HTX_LOCATIONS method of identifying document locations and
#        HTX_DOCTYPES for specifying alternative document types.
#     11-MAY-1995 (RFWS):
#        Set configuration variables for use as the main HTX server at RAL.
#     11-JUL-1995 (RFWS):
#        Set new default configuration for use at RAL.
#     24-NOV-1995 (RFWS):
#        Changed to use new index files by depending on standard HTX scripts.
#        Also introduced the use of catalogue files and simplified the error
#        reporting. Added link to SUN/188 in error messages.
#     22-JAN-2009 (TIMJ):
#        SUN/188 URL uses $server_url rather than hard coded RAL address
#        URLGEN does not include localhost in its file:// URL
#     23-JAN-2009 (TIMJ):
#        Further cleaning up of URLs.
