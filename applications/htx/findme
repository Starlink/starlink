#  Name:
#     findme

#  Purpose:
#     Search for documents by keyword and display a list of those found.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This command performs keyword searching of locally-available documents
#     and displays a list of those found using a WWW browser. This list
#     includes "hot links" to the parts of each document that were matched.

#  Invocation:
#     findme [switches] [keyword] [doclist]

#  Parameters:
#     keyword
#        The string of characters to be searched for. This is treated as a
#        single string (not as multiple keywords) and should be quoted if it
#        contains special characters or white space. Pattern matching
#        characters, as used in "sed" or "grep" regular expressions, may be
#        included.
#
#        If this parameter is omitted, then all documents searched will be
#        matched. This provides a convenient way of listing all of the
#        documents available.
#     doclist
#        An optional space-separated list of the documents to be searched. If
#        this is omitted, then the complete set of hypertext documents will be
#        searched, as found on the HTX_PATH search path or its default (see
#        below). Any further documents described in "catalogue files" (see
#        SUN/188) appearing in any of the directories searched will also be
#        included.

#  Switches:
#     -b
#        Requests that a "brief" list be produced of the documents found. This
#        means that only document names and titles will appear and references
#        to individual pages will be omitted. By default, individual pages will
#        be listed if the search has included them and they match the search
#        criteria.
#     -c
#        Indicates that case is significant when searching for the keyword. By
#        default, differences in case are ignored.
#     -f
#        Indicates that a full search should be performed, involving searching
#        document names, titles, page headings and lines of text. This option
#        is shorthand for the swiches "-n", "-t", "-h" and "-l" used together.
#     -h
#        Indicates that a search for the keyword is to be performed on all the
#        page headings within each document (a page heading consists of the
#        contents of the HTML "<TITLE>...</TITLE>" section for that page, but
#        excluding the top page of each document). This provides a convenient
#        compromise between speed of execution and full search coverage, and
#        generally produces an acceptable amount of output. By default, a
#        search on page headings is only performed if a keyword cannot be
#        found in any document title. Page headings may only be searched in
#        hypertext (".htx") documents.
#     -html
#        Indicates that the list of documents found by this command should not
#        be displayed using a WWW browser. Instead, the results are simply
#        written to standard output as a list in HTML format. None of the
#        surrounding HTML tags or normal output decoration are included. This
#        provides a simplified interface for other software that can handle
#        displaying the results itself.
#     -l
#        Indicates that a search for the keyword is to be performed on all
#        lines of text within each document (note that this will include all
#        HTML tags, URLs, etc.). This provides the fullest possible form of
#        keyword search, but may take some time to complete and could generate
#        a large volume of output. By default, a search of document lines is
#        only performed if a keyword cannot be found in any document title or
#        page heading. Line-oriented searching can only be performed on
#        hypertext (".htx") documents.
#     -m
#        Indicates that the output list is to contain information on which
#        search criteria were matched and how many matches were found. By
#        default, this information is omitted.
#     -n
#        Indicates that a search for the keyword is to be performed on the
#        name of each document (a document's name is determined by the name of
#        the file or directory in which it resides, or by its entry in a
#        catalogue file). Searching of document names is not performed by
#        default.
#     -q
#        Indicates that the search should progress in "quiet" mode without
#        producing messages about progress. By default, messages about the
#        progress of the search are written to /dev/tty.
#     -s
#        Indicates that the output list is to be sorted so that the most
#        significant matches appear first and the least significant last.
#        In assessing this, matches to the document name are given the highest
#        significance, then matches to titles, page headings and finally lines
#        of textual content. An alphabetical sort on document title and page
#        heading is used to resolve any remaining ambiguity over output order.
#        By default, a simple alphabetical sort on document title and page
#        heading is used alone.
#     -t
#        Indicates that a search for the keyword is to be performed on the
#        title of each document (the title of a hypertext document consists of
#        the contents of the HTML "<TITLE>...</TITLE>" section for the top page
#        of that document). This provides a quick but effective form of search
#        for major topics and gives at most one entry in the output list for
#        each document matched. By default, title matching is performed first,
#        and a search of page headings (and eventually lines of textual
#        content) is performed only if this initial search fails to match any
#        documents. Using "-t" prevents these subsequent searches from
#        happening automatically.
#     -w
#        Indicates that the keyword supplied must match an entire word (i.e. a
#        string delimited by characters which are not underscores or
#        alphanumerics, or delimited by the beginning or end of the text, or
#        by a newline). By default, the specified string of characters is
#        matched wherever it occurs, so long as it does not span multiple
#        lines of text.
#     -warn
#        Indicates that any warning messages issued by the WWW browser (e.g.
#        when it is started up) are to be suppressed. By default, these
#        warnings are written to standard error along with any other warning
#        or error messages.

#  Examples:
#     findme
#        Finds all available documents.
#     findme guide
#        Finds all documents with the string "guide" in them. This is done
#        by first searching their titles, then (if that fails) by searching
#        all their page headings, then (if that also fails) by searching all
#        of their lines of text.
#     findme -t guide
#        Finds all documents with the string "guide" in their title (only
#        titles are searched).
#     findme -n sun
#        Finds all documents whose names contain the string "sun".
#     findme -w star
#        Finds documents that contain "star" as a word on its own.
#     findme -c GNS
#        Finds documents that contain the string "GNS" with the correct
#        capitalisation.
#     findme -l -b unix
#        Searches all lines of text in all documents for the string "unix" and
#        displays a brief listing of the results, so that only the relevant
#        document names and titles are shown.
#     findme -h DAT_ sun92
#        Finds a document called "sun92" and searches its page headings (only)
#        for the string "DAT_". Each page which matches is listed.
#     findme -t -h '?\$' docs/$*$.htx
#        Searches the titles and page headings of all hypertext documents
#        stored in directory "docs" and lists those which end in a question
#        mark ('?\$' is a regular expression specifying that the question mark
#        be at the end of a line).
#     findme -h -html -q "\$keyword" pkg\_manual >>/tmp/results\$\$
#        This command might be used to provide a command lookup facility for a
#        software package. It searches all the page headings in
#        "pkg_manual" for the command stored in the "keyword" variable
#        and appends the resulting list (in HTML format) to a scratch file in
#        which an HTML page of results is being constructed. Messages about
#        the progress of the search are suppressed with the "-q" switch.

#  Environment Variables Used:
#     HTX_BROWSER
#        This defines the command which will be used to invoke the WWW browser.
#        In order that the browser being used can be recognised, this command
#        should contain a string corresponding to one of the supported WWW
#        browsers - currently "netscape" or "Mosaic" (case insensitive). If
#        this variable is not set, then the command "Mosaic" is used by
#        default.
#     HTX_PATH
#        An optional colon-separated list of directories in which to search for
#        hypertext documents. If this environment variable is not set, the
#        default is to search the directories containing the HTX documentation,
#        followed by those containing the rest of the Starlink documentation
#        (if different). See SUN/188 for full details.
#     HTX_SERVER
#        The URL of the document server to be used for serving remote
#        documents. This will be used as a prefix in all URLs that refer to
#        remote documents. If this environment variable is not set, the value
#        used is "http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver".
#     HTX_TMP
#        The name of the directory in which to create temporary communication
#        files. If this variable is not set, or is null, $HOME/.htxtmp is used
#        instead.

#  Notes On Searching:
#     -  If none of the switches "-n", "-t", "-h" or "-l" is used, the keyword
#     given will first be searched for in the title of each document. If this
#     fails to produce a match, it will next be searched for in the page
#     headings of each document. If this also fails to produce a match, a final
#     search of the lines of text within each docement will be made.
#     -  If one or more of the switches "-n", "-t", "-h" or "-l" is used, the
#     automatic sequences of searches described above will not occur. Instead,
#     only those document components specified by these switches (name, title,
#     page header and lines of text, respectively) will be searched. This will
#     be done in a single pass through all documents.
#     -  To obtain the fullest possible (but slowest) search, use the "-f"
#     option. This is equivalent using all of the switches "-n", "-t", "-h"
#     and "-l" together.

#  Notes on Specifying Documents:
#     -  If no documents are specified, then all directories on the HTX_PATH
#     search path will be inspected for hypertext (".htx") documents and all
#     those found will be searched.
#     -  In addition, if any directory on the search path contains a file named
#     "htx.catalogue", then it is interpreted as a catalogue file (see SUN/188)
#     which lists the names, files and titles of additional documents not
#     available locally in hypertext form. These documents will also be
#     included in any search of document name or title (but not searches of
#     page headings or lines of text).
#     -  If one or more document names are supplied, then the search will be
#     restricted to the specified documents only.
#     -  If document names are supplied without directory information, then
#     they will be located by following the HTX_PATH search path, or its
#     default (see SUN/188). The contents of any catalogue files (see above)
#     will also be considered when searching for documents.
#     -  If document names are supplied with explicit directory information,
#     then they must refer to hypertext documents and no search will be made
#     for them.
#     -  Any ".htx" extension on document names is ignored.
#     -  If hypertext documents with the same name are found in more than one
#     directory, then the one found first takes precedence.
#     -  If documents with the same name are found both locally in hypertext
#     form and in one or more catalogue files, then the hypertext version takes
#     precedence.
#     -  If a document with the same name appears more than once in the list
#     given for the "doclist" parameter, then the first occurrence takes
#     precedence, except that the first occurrence of a name with explicit
#     directory information always takes precedence over the same document
#     specified without directory information.
#     -  If the same document is found in more than one catalogue file, or
#     occurs more than once in any of these files (and is not over-ridden by
#     a local hypertext version), then all occurrences will be used. This
#     allows multiple document titles to be provided in catalogue files to
#     enhance the probability of a keyword match. However, the behaviour is
#     undefined if these entries refer to different document files.
#     -  If any document that is matched appears in a catalogue file, but the
#     file containing the document cannot be found on the local file system,
#     then a reference to the remote document server will be generated as a
#     link to that document. This reference will take the standard form (i.e.
#     it will refer to the document by name and not by the file it resides in).
#     This allows catalogue files to be used as local indices for documents
#     stored remotely, in whatever format.

#  Examples:
#     findme
#        Finds all available documents.
#     findme guide
#        Finds all documents with the string "guide" in them. This is done
#        by first searching their titles, then (if that fails) by searching
#        all their page headings, then (if that also fails) by searching all
#        of their lines of text.
#     findme -t guide
#        Finds all documents with the string "guide" in their title (only
#        titles are seached).
#     findme -n sun
#        Finds all documents whose names contain the string "sun".
#     findme -w star
#        Finds documents that contain "star" as a word on its own.
#     findme -c GnS
#        Finds documents that contain the string "GnS" with the correct
#        capitalisation.
#     findme -l -b unix
#        Searches all lines of text in all documents for the string "unix" and
#        displays a brief listing of the results, so that only the relevant
#        document names and titles are shown.
#     findme -h DAT_ sun92
#        Finds a document called "sun92" and searches its page headings (only)
#        for the string "DAT_". Each page which matches is listed.
#     findme -t -h '?$' docs/*.htx
#        Searches the titles and page headings of all hypertext documents
#        stored in directory "docs" and lists those which end in a question
#        mark ('?$' is a regular expression specifying that there should be a
#        question mark at the end of a line).
