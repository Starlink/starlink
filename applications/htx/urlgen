#  Name:
#     urlgen

#  Purpose:
#     Generate a URL for a document reference.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This script accepts the name of a document and (optionally) a
#     cross-reference label within it and generates the URL needed to access
#     the specified part of the document.

#  Invocation:
#     urlgen doc [label]

#  Parameters:
#     doc
#        The name of the document. If no directory information is supplied,
#        this will be searched for using the HTX_PATH search path (or its
#        default, if necessary).
#     label
#        An optional cross-reference label. If given, this specifies which
#        part of the document is required. If omitted, it is assumed that the
#        "entire" document is required and a URL for the appropriate "top"
#        page is returned.
#
#        The label supplied may contain pattern matching characters (for use
#        by the "sed" utility), in which case the alphabetically first match to
#        a label in the document will be used.

#  Environment Variables Used:
#     HTX_PATH
#        An optional colon-separated list of directories in which to search for
#        hypertext documents. If this environment variable is not defined, a
#        default is used (see the htxpath script).
#     HTX_SERVER
#        The URL of the document server to be used for serving remote
#        documents. This will be used as a prefix in all URLs that refer to
#        remote documents. If this environment variable is not set, the value
#        used is "http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver".
#     HTX_WHERE
#        If this is set to "l", it specifies that a local document is required
#        and that no reference to a remote document server should be generated.
#        In this case, if the document cannot be found locally no URL is
#        returned.
#
#        If HTX_WHERE is set to "r", it specifies that a remote document is
#        required. In this case, a reference to a remote document server will
#        be generated, even if a local copy of the document exists.
#
#        If HTX_WHERE has neither of the above values, a local file reference
#        will be generated if the document is found locally, otherwise a
#        remote URL will be generated.
#     HTX_URLSED
#        If set, the URL to be calculated is processed by sed using the 
#        pattern stored in this variable. This is done as an environment
#        variable rather than a command line switch to make it easier for
#        something that calls urlgen through another script
#        to also modify the findme arguments. This may possibly be a hack.

#  Notes:
#     -  If a cross-reference label is specified but it cannot be found in
#     a local document, then an error will result.
#     -  There is no checking of the existence of remote documents, nor of
#     the cross-reference labels they contain.
