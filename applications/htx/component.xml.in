  <description>Hypertext Cross-reference Utilities</description>
  <abstract>
    <p>HTX is a set of ``Hypertext Cross-Reference Utilities'', which are
    designed to help maintain large documentation sets whose constituent
    documents are written using the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
    </p>
    <p>The central part of HTX is a hypertext linker, hlink. This allows
    hyper-links (or cross-references) to be established between related
    documents in such a way that it is easy to maintain their integrity as
    individual documents are updated. Information produced by this linking
    process is also used by other HTX utilities to provide document search
    facilities and the ability to randomly access any part of a documentation
    set. This latter capability forms a basis for constructing hypertext
    help systems for use by other software.
