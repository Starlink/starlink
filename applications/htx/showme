#  Name:
#     showme

#  Purpose:
#     Display a specified part of a document using a WWW browser.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script

#  Description:
#     This command takes the name of a document and (optionally) the name of a
#     cross-reference label within it, and displays the requested part of the
#     document using a WWW browser. It may also be used to display local files
#     or any other WWW page for which a URL is available.

#  Invocation:
#     showme [switches] doc [label]

#  Parameters:
#     doc
#        The name of the document. If no directory information is supplied,
#        the document will be located using the HTX_PATH search path or its
#        default (see below). If directory information is given, no search will
#        be performed. In either case, a ".htx" extension to the document name
#        is optional.
#
#        If the "-f" option is used, this parameter is interpreted as the name
#        of a local file which is to be displayed. If the "-u" option is used,
#        it is interpreted as a general URL.
#     label
#        An optional cross-reference label. If given, this specifies which
#        part of the document is required. If omitted, it is assumed that the
#        entire document is required and the appropriate "top" page (see
#        SUN/188) is displayed.
#
#        This parameter is ignored if the "-f" or "-u" options are used.

#  Switches:
#     -f
#        Specifies that the document name supplied is the name of a local file
#        (e.g. in HTML format) which is to be displayed. If this option is
#        used, the "label" parameter and the "-l" and "-r" switches are
#        ignored.
#     -l
#        Specifies that a local document should be displayed and that no
#        reference to a remote document server should be generated. In this
#        case, if the document cannot be found locally an error will result.
#     -n
#        Specifies that the document is not to be displayed. In this case, no
#        WWW browser will be used and the URL that would otherwise have been
#        passed to it is simply written to standard output. This provides a
#        simplified interface for use by other software that can handle
#        document display itself.
#     -r
#        Specifies that a remote document is required. In this case, a
#        reference to a remote document server will be generated and passed to
#        the WWW browser, even if a local copy of the document exists.
#     -u
#        Specifies that the document name supplied is a URL which is to be
#        passed directly to the WWW browser for interpretation. Any form of URL
#        which the browser can handle may be given. If this option is used, the
#        "label" parameter and the "-l" and "-r" switches are ignored.
#     -warn
#        Indicates that any warning messages issued by the WWW browser (e.g.
#        when it is started up) are to be suppressed. By default, these
#        warnings are written to standard error along with any other warning
#        or error messages.

#  Examples:
#     showme sun188
#        Displays the document called "sun188". The local copy is used, if
#        available, otherwise it is fetched from the remote document server.
#     showme sun188 showme
#        Displays the part of document "sun188" identified by the
#        cross-reference label "showme". As before, the local copy of the
#        document is used, if possible.
#     showme -l quantum-theory
#        Searches for a local copy of the document "quantum-theory" and
#        displays it. If the document cannot be found locally, an error
#        results.
#     showme -r quantum-theory speculation
#        Displays the section identified by the "speculation"
#        cross-reference label in a remote copy of the document called
#        "quantum-theory". Any local copy is ignored.
#     showme mydocs/help available_commands
#        Displays the section identified by the "available_commands" label
#        in a local document stored in the directory "mydocs/help.htx".
#        Because explicit directory information is given, the document is not
#        searched for using the HTX_PATH search path. If the document doesn't
#        exist, a copy will be fetched from the remote document server.
#     showme -n -l mydocs/help available_commands
#        Performs the same function as the previous example, except that the
#        document is not actually displayed. Instead, its URL is simply
#        written to standard output. The "-l" switch specifies that a local
#        document is required, so an error will result if it cannot be found.

#  Environment Variables Used:
#     HTX_BROWSER
#        This defines the command which will be used to invoke the WWW browser.
#        In order that the browser being used can be recognised, this command
#        should contain a string corresponding to one of the supported WWW
#        browsers - currently "netscape" or "Mosaic" (case insensitive). If
#        this variable is not set, then the command "Mosaic" is used by
#        default.
#     HTX_PATH
#        An optional colon-separated list of directories in which to search for
#        hypertext documents. If this environment variable is not set, the
#        default is to search the directories containing the HTX documentation,
#        followed by those containing the rest of the Starlink documentation
#        (if different). See SUN/188 for full details.
#     HTX_SERVER
#        The URL of the document server to be used for serving remote
#        documents. This will be used as a prefix in all URLs that refer to
#        remote documents. If this environment variable is not set, the value
#        used is "http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver".
#     HTX_TMP
#        The name of the directory in which to create temporary communication
#        files. If this variable is not set, or is null, $HOME/.htxtmp is used
#        instead.

#  Notes:
#     -  If the document is found locally, the local copy will be displayed.
#     If it is not found locally (subject to any command switches) a reference
#     to a remote document server will be passed to the WWW browser instead.
#     -  If a cross-reference label is specified for a local document but it
#     cannot be found in that document, then an error will result.
#     -  There is no checking of the existence of remote documents, nor of
#     the cross-reference labels they contain. This checking must be performed
#     by the remote document server.
#     -  The "-l" and "-r" switches are mutually exclusive. If both are given,
#     the latter one predominates.
#     -  Similarly, the "-f" and "-u" switches are mutually exclusive. If both
#     are given, the latter one predominates.
