#  Purpose:
#     Test for SCB to see if it handles C files with long comments.

#  Description:
#     If you build the tagging routines using flex in its default
#     configuration, it fails on some files with very long tokens
#     (usually comments).  Good examples are to be found in the
#     AST package.  This script tries the C tagger against some of
#     these to see whether it chokes or not.
#
#     The build machinery which persuades FLEX to build a scanner
#     which passes this test involves using a custom flex.skl file.
#     This may not be very portable.
#
#     This file is edited by configure prior to use.
