<subsect id=release-0.5 export>Release Notes, version DR-0.5

<p>This is developers' release 0.5.

<subsubsect>New in this release

<p>Prior to the SGML meeting scheduled for Friday 24 September, I've
made assorted further changes of detail, mostly to the Programcode
DTD, as agreed at the last programmers' meeting.  These have been
implemented in both the HTML and &latex; down-converters, but not yet
documented.

<subsubsect>Changes

<p>The following are the changes to the Programcode DTD agreed after
the last meeting. 
<dl>

<dt>CODEPROLOGUE content model
<dd>The CODEPROLOGUE element has changed to ROUTINEPROLOGUE, and
almost all of its contents are now optional, as well as being in any
order.  As a result, the MISCCODE element is redundant, and has been
removed.

<dt>Paragraph content
<dd>The paragraph content model has been substantially enlarged, and
is now identical with that of the General DTD, with the exception of
the cross-reference elements.  As part of this, the General DTD was
substantially restructured, to extract the paragraph-content elements
into a separate DTD fragment, which the two DTDs share.

<dt>The changes are implemented in the down-converters
<dd>&ellip; though not very prettily.  They <em/should/ be robust
enough that trial documents conforming to the updated DTDs should be
testable.

<dt>Defects list added
<dd>The `defects list' is now part of the maintained code, and
included in the distribution.  This is the (supposedly authoritative)
list of what changes have been suggested, and comments on their
implementation.


</dl>

<subsubsect>Outstanding issues

<p>This is the to-do list.  These are the issues which should either
be addressed before the next full release, or postponed as being
unresolvable just now.  For more wishful thinking, see <ref
id=final.development>.

<p>This is more-or-less the same to-do list as in the previous release
(see <ref id=release-0.4> for details).  This release has concentrated
on the issues arising from the last programmers' meeting.

<dl>
<dt>Bundle Jade with the system
<dd>At present, the distribution consists of the SGML kit plus a Jade
distribution.  However, I still haven't managed to get Jade to build
on Suns or Alphas.  This might change, as work has started -- by the
community rather than James Clark alone -- on an open-source version
of Jade called <webref url='http://jade-cvs.avionitek.com/'
>OpenJade</webref>.  This <em/might/ include work on getting Jade to
build on other platforms.

<dt>Use of FPI: should we use <code>-//Starlink//...</code> or
<code>+//IDN star.rl.ac.uk...</code>? 
<dd>I haven't had any comments or thoughts on this.

<dt>Include some facility for dealing with obsolete exported IDs.
<dd>Since I've had no objections to this structure, I'll include DTD
and down-converter support for this anon.

<dt>Development of the down-converters for the programcode DTD
<dd>These currently work, but the results are hideously ugly.  The
changes also need to be documented.

<dt>Bugs in Jade's LaTeX back-end
<dd>I've since discovered that my identification of these as bugs was
mistaken.  They're features: the character-reference mechanism I
thought was failing was actually the wrong approach, Jade was
correctly barfing on it, and my `fix' was a dirty rotten hack;
unfortunately, Jade doesn't yet seem to support the correct approach,
but OpenJade might soon.

<dt>OpenJade
<dd>I'll see if it's sensible to shift to OpenJade away from Clark's
distribution.

<dt>Defects list
<dd>There are a variety of more-or-less urgent issues notes in the
Defects list.

</dl>


<subsect id=release-0.4 export>Release Notes, version DR-0.4

<p>This is developers' release 0.4.

<subsubsect>New in this release

<p>After a long discussion at the August programmers' meeting, and a
detailed discussion with Mark Taylor, there have been numerous changes
of detail, but few substantial additions.

<subsubsect>Changes

<p>The following are the changes agreed after the last meeting.
<dl>

<dt>Equations
<dd>Equations are now numbered, and can be referred to.  The
definition of the equation elements has changed slightly, with the
addition of the MLINE content to MEQNARRAY and the addition of the
MLABEL element.  Generation of the GIF versions of the equations is
smoother (well, should be -- I'm still unsure how sensitive the
dvi2bitmap program is to its &tex; environment).

<dt>Tables
<dd>There is now a TABULAR element for tablar material, which sits
within the TABLE element, which is responsible for matters such as
captioning and floating the result.  This orthogonality means that
TABULAR is now a `structuring' element, at the same level as elements
like BLOCKQUOTE and lists, so it can appear within paragraphs.

<dt>Cross references
<dd>The DOCXREF element now has a title attribute, allowing you to
override the generation of the link text.  Also, I've added a
<code/%short-crossrefs%/ parameter to the DSSSL stylesheets (set true
buy default), which allows you to control whether you get short or
long generated text.

<dt>Figure notations
<dd>The set of figure notations has expanded, now including (after
much debate) arbitrary &latex; as an acceptable notation.  At the same
time, the content model for the FIGURE element has changed, so that
each FIGURECONTENT element now specifies a single alternative.

<dt>Assorted bug-fixing
<dd>Includes wrinkles in the DTD as well as in the down-converters.

</dl>

<subsubsect>Outstanding issues

<p>This is the to-do list.  These are the issues which should either
be addressed before the next full release, or postponed as being
unresolvable just now.  For more wishful thinking, see <ref
id=final.development>.

<p>This is more-or-less the same to-do list as in the previous release
(see <ref id=release-0.3> for details).  This release has concentrated
on the issues arising from the last programmers' meeting.

<dl>
<dt>Bundle Jade with the system
<dd>At present, the distribution consists of the SGML kit plus a Jade
distribution.  However, I still haven't managed to get Jade to build
on Suns or Alphas.  This might change, as work has started -- by the
community rather than James Clark alone -- on an open-source version
of Jade called <webref url='http://jade-cvs.avionitek.com/'
>OpenJade</webref>.  This <em/might/ include work on getting Jade to
build on other platforms.

<dt>Use of FPI: should we use <code>-//Starlink//...</code> or
<code>+//IDN star.rl.ac.uk...</code>? 
<dd>I haven't had any comments or thoughts on this.

<dt>Include some facility for dealing with obsolete exported IDs.
<dd>Since I've had no objections to this structure, I'll include DTD
and down-converter support for this anon.

<dt>Development of the programcode DTD
<dd>There was discussion of this at the programmers' meeting, and
there will be developments before the next release.

<dt>Bugs in Jade's LaTeX back-end
<dd>I've since discovered that my identification of these as bugs was
mistaken.  They're features: the character-reference mechanism I
thought was failing was actually the wrong approach, Jade was
correctly barfing on it, and my `fix' was a dirty rotten hack;
unfortunately, Jade doesn't yet seem to support the correct approach,
but OpenJade might soon.

<dt>DTD and down-converter changes forthcoming
<dd>Assorted changes to the programcode DTD were mooted and disputed;
I'll add these.  The HTML down-converter should be extended to process
&latex; code in the `latexgraphics' notation.  Clive suggested the
addition of hours and degrees elements.

<dt>OpenJade
<dd>I'll see if it's sensible to shift to OpenJade away from Clark's
distribution.

</dl>


<subsect id=release-0.3 export>Release Notes, version DR-0.3

<p>This is developers' release 0.3.

<p>The system relies on the DSSSL engine Jade, but
it does <em/not/ contain a pre-built version of Jade.  See <ref
id=install> for further details of obtaining and building Jade.

<subsubsect>New in this release

<p>Additional features include some hooks for customising the
output, described in <ref id=appx.system.paramdsssl>.  The generation
of the backmatter was rewritten.  Numerous other fixes and tweaks.

<subsubsect>Changes

<p>Mostly from the last to-do list.
<dl>

<dt>Changes in DTD
<dd>UPDATE element can now go at the end of the SUBHEAD (ie,
effectively before the beginning of the section content.  BACKMATTER
is now an empty element, with a 
`bibliography' attribute, so elements bibliography, indexcontents and
notecontents have disappeared.  Addition of `type' formatting-hint
attribute to code element.  Addition of %simplephrase formatting
elements to content model of verbatim.

<dt>Finish documentation
<dd>Considerable additions to the developer/maintainer section.
Various other corrections and additions, some required by changes to
the DTD in this release.

<dt>Output of HTML down-converter should be compatible with HTX.
<dd>Output modified with this intent.  FIXME: not yet checked against hlink.

<dt>Coverpage image in DTD
<dd>Done

<dt>BOS and manifest support
<dd>There's no support for extraction of the BOS (the `bounded object set', a
formally-definable list of the entities required in a `complete'
source document set) from a source document.  This is easy to extract
yourself: any files included in an SGML document must be declared as
entities in the Declaration Subset, you you can construct a BOS by hand
perfectly reliably.
<p>The stylesheets now generate a manifest of generated files, in
<code/HTML.manifest/ and <code/LaTeX.manifest/ (configurable).

<dt>Dealing with exported labels: emit a TOC of
exported IDs at end, with links both ways
<dd>The `link policy' is expressed in DTD.  The exported-id list has
been catered for by adding a customisation variable
<code/show-element-ids/ (see <ref id=appx.system.paramdsssl>) so that
you can prepare a version of the document which displays these IDs.
This isn't quite the same thing, but the other can be added if anyone
feels strongly about it.

<dt>Sectioning: the references to CODECOLLECTION sections within
ROUTINECODE elements come out with the wrong numbers.
<dd>Fixed

<dt>Include a print button in the generated HTML.
<dd>Done.

<dt>Updated Jade patches
<dd>I've fixed a couple of buglets in the Jade back-end I produced.
The stylesheets now need version <code/1.2.1-starlink-1.0b2/.

</dl>

<subsubsect>Outstanding issues

<p>This is the to-do list.  These are the issues which should either
be addressed before the next full release, or postponed as being
unresolvable just now.  For more wishful thinking, see <ref
id=final.development>.

<dl>
<dt>Bundle Jade with the system
<dd>At present, the distribution consists only of the SGML library stuff.
I need to work out the magic to get Jade to build on Suns and Alphas,
and then distribute them together.  Since Jade is needed to build the
documetation during installation, you can't even install the package
on systems which don't have Jade.  I therefore haven't tested the
installation makefile other than on Linux: Tru64's make is dumb enough
that I can just about guarantee that there'll be problems there.

<dt>Finish documentation
<dd>Read-through for style, plus more expansive installation notes.

<dt>Use of FPI: should we use <code>-//Starlink//...</code> or
<code>+//IDN star.rl.ac.uk...</code>? 
<dd>The second is a standard `registered prefix' built up from a DNS
domain name.  Is there any prospect of a <code>starlink.ac.uk</code>
domain name?

<dt>Include some facility for dealing with obsolete exported IDs.
<dd>One
possibility (discussed at the programmers' meeting) was <code>&lt;sect
id=newid>Intro&lt;oldid id=oldid></code>, but that's not very flexible
-- it'd only apply to sections.  I thought instead of
<verbatim><![CDATA[
<!element oldidlist o o (oldid+)>
<!element oldid     - o EMPTY>
<!attlist oldid
	id	id	#required	-- the now-obsolete id --
	newid	idref	#requred	-- replacement --
	-- resolve a reference to this element as if it were a
           reference to the element pointed to by newid, but
	   warn or issue an error about a deprecation --
	export	(export) #fixed export	-- for compat/consistency? --
	>
]]></verbatim>
This means that at the top of the document (probably), you could
include a list of elements:
<verbatim>
&lt;oldidlist>
&lt;oldid id=old.id newid=replacement.id>
&lt;oldid id=another.id newid=another.replacement>
&lt;/oldidlist>
</verbatim>
This is both perfectly generic, and usefully visible.

<dt>Development of the programcode DTD
<dd>As discussed in <ref id=doccode.devel>, I am uncertain of the
optimal balance between flexibility and structure in the programcode
DTD.  We need to reach a consensus on this before the structure is frozen.

<dt>Bugs in Jade's LaTeX back-end
<dd>There's a deficiency in the &latex; back-end I added to
Jade.  There's some weakness in the way that
characters are output, which results in SDATA entities not being
processed properly, when
the character data is obtained via (data) rather than
(process-children).  Unfortunately, I think that fixing this
one is going to need more knowledge of Jade internals than I have to
hand right now.  The only available workaround is to avoid using any
of the entities in <ref id=table.entities> within `DT' elements (which
is the only place the stylesheet uses the feature which triggers the
bug).  If you fall victim to the bug, the only effect would be a
<code/&amp;#65533/ or <code/\\char65533/ in the output, which might
confuse a browser or &latex, but do nothing worse.

<dt>Bugs in the mk script
<dd>There are currently a few missing targets in the installation makefile.

</dl>


<subsect id=release-0.2 export>Release Notes, version 0.2

<p>This is developers' release 0.2.

<subsubsect>New in this release

<p>This release consists of the SGML DTDs, down-converters, and other
miscellaneous software.

<p>The system relies on the DSSSL engine Jade, but
it does <em/not/ contain a pre-built version of Jade.  Jade turns out
to be a real hassle to build with a compiler other than gcc.  The
author, James Clark, is a fine programmer, but apparently a bit of a
standards purist (he was involved with writing the DSSSL standard, and
with the development of XML/XSL): he seems to take the position that a
standards document is an adequate C++ user manual, and doesn't appear
to believe that porting software to non-conforming compilers should be
high on his priority list.  Jade builds
perfectly happily on gcc, but I've been struggling away for ages
trying to get it to build using Sun's and Digital's C++ compilers.  I
will distribute a runnable version of Jade eventually, but for the
moment, you'll have to build Jade yourself.  If <em/you/ manage to
build it using one of those, could you tell me what you had to do....

<p>Get Jade from Clark's <webref
url='http://www.jclark.com/jade/' >Jade pages</webref>.  Before you
build it, you need to patch it to a Starlink-specific version, using
the patch at
<url>http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/norman/distrib/jade.html</url>.
The configuration you'll need is:
<verbatim>
% mkdir -p /my/star/bin/sgml/bin /my/star/bin/sgml/lib
% ./configure --enable-latex --prefix=/my/star/bin/sgml
% make
% make install
</verbatim>

<subsubsect>Outstanding issues

<p>This is the to-do list.  It still contains several small items from
the last programmers' meeting.  These are important, but not
show-stopping.

<dl>
<dt>Bundle Jade with the system
<dd>At present, the distribution consists only of the SGML library stuff.
I need to work out the magic to get Jade to build on Suns and Alphas,
and then distribute them together.

<dt>Finish documentation
<dd>This should be considered a first draft of the documentation -- it
needs a proper read-through, plus additions concerned with installing
the software, plus more detailed developer/maintainer notes.

<dt>Output of HTML down-converter should be compatible with HTX.
<dd>Should need nothing more than a quick check that this is true

<dt>Use of FPI: should we use <code>-//Starlink//...</code> or
<code>+//IDN star.rl.ac.uk...</code>? 
<dd>The second is a standard `registered prefix' built up from a DNS
domain name.  Is there any prospect of a <code>starlink.ac.uk</code>
domain name?

<dt>Coverpage image in DTD
<dd>Coming...

<dt>Dealing with exported labels: do not export by default, but warn very
        visibly (or fail) if policy not followed; emit a TOC of
        exported IDs at end, with links both ways; produce appropriate
        comments in HTML.
<dd>The `link policy' is expressed in DTD.  The exported-id list will
be little work.

<dt>Include some facility for dealing with obsolete exported IDs.
<dd>One
possibility (discussed at the programmers' meeting) was <code>&lt;sect
id=newid>Intro&lt;oldid id=oldid></code>, but that's not very flexible
-- it'd only apply to sections.  I thought instead of
<verbatim><![CDATA[
<!element oldidlist o o (oldid+)>
<!element oldid     - o EMPTY>
<!attlist oldid
	id	id	#required	-- the now-obsolete id --
	newid	idref	#requred	-- replacement --
	-- resolve a reference to this element as if it were a
           reference to the element pointed to by newid, but
	   warn or issue an error about a deprecation --
	export	(export) #fixed export	-- for compat/consistency? --
	>
]]></verbatim>
This means that at the top of the document (probably), you could
include a list of elements:
<verbatim>
&lt;oldidlist>
&lt;oldid id=old.id newid=replacement.id>
&lt;oldid id=another.id newid=another.replacement>
&lt;/oldidlist>
</verbatim>
This is both perfectly generic, and usefully visible.

<dt>Include a print button in the generated HTML.
<dd>Easy

<dt>Sectioning: the references to CODECOLLECTION sections within
ROUTINECODE elements come out with the wrong numbers.
<dd>This probably needs some detailed fixing of
the code in (make-section-reference), but nothing too taxing.

<dt>BOS support
<dd>Support extraction of the BOS (the `bounded object set', a
formally-definable list of the entities required in a `complete'
source document set) from a source document.  This is
related to, but distinct from, the issue of generating a manifest of
generated files for packaging and 
distribution.  The latter isn't completely resolved, as
it's not transparently clear what to do with the entity declared
values of the codecollection and docxref elements.  Needs thought.

<dt>Include elements for Examples, Notes, Warnings?
<dd>I think that examples should go within %body.content, and
contain paragraphs.  Notes and warnings should be in p.content?  I'm
not sure how necessary it is to support these so explicitly.

</dl>
