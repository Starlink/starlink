<subsect id=release-0.6 export>Release Notes, version DR-0.6

<p>This is developers' release 0.6.

<subsubsect>New in this release

<p><ul>

<li>The down-conversion is now driven by a script, <code/sgml2docs/,
as described in <ref id=proc.sgml2docs>.  This required a non-trivial
amount of internal rearrangement, none of which should be visible to
authors.

<li>Significantly upgraded the error handling in the case where a
<code/docxref/ cross-reference target cannot be resolved.  The
stylesheet does not complain in this case, but instead synthesises a
reference to the RAL document server, as long as the public identifier
is in the correct format.  Jade still gives a warning in this case
(which it's not easy to turn off), but it doesn't invalidate the
document.

<li>There was a minor conflict in the list of hyperlinking
requirements.  I implemented the requirements that the `top' file in
the <code/.htx/ directory be <code/index.html/ and that the filenames
shouldn't include the document name.  However, having
<code/index.html/ confuses <code/hlink/, which seems to need the file
to be called <code/sunxxx.html/ (apart from that, <code/hlink/ appears
to work fine, with no trace of a problem with the slightly eccentric
format of the Jade output).  I've therefore left it with the top file
being called <code/sunxxx.html/, so that <code/hlink/ will continue to
work, 

<li>The SGML declaration was changed in such a way that IDs within the
document are now case-sensitive.  This could not be done without
making all the other SGML in the application case-sensitive as well.
This required substantial reorganisation.

</ul>

<subsubsect>Decisions from 1999 September 24 meeting, Durham


<subsubsubsect>Packaging and Installation
<p><dl compact>

<dt>Multi-platform support deferred.
<dd>No action required.

<dt>Everything packaged as one lump. Norman and Martin to decide how 
     to arrange packing details (build, installation).
<dd><code/dvi2bitmap/ incorporated into package.

<dt>Makefile to support all standard targets.
<dd>??

<dt>Do not produce document summaries when sgmlstar is installed.
<dd>Done.

<dt>No documentation processing when standard packages are installed.
Each package has printable (optional), HTML and SGML.
<dd>Documentation build at export time.  HTX and &latex; documentation
included in package, but no SGML.  This is because SGML files can, in
general, include files from elsewhere, either as simple inclusions (as
is the case for the DTD documentation in this document), or as
subdocument references (as is the case for any program source code
marked up in the programcode DTD.  This makes packaging of the SGML
source not necessarily trivial.  It can, of course, still be done if
we feel there's a need for it, but it's not done in the case of this
package.

</dl>

<subsubsubsect>Running Down Converters 
<p><dl compact> 
<dt>Need simple commands <code/sgml2latex/ and <code/sgml2html/
instead of makefile, leaving no temporary files (even in the event of
failure), and doing all necessary processing (maths, backmatter, etc).  
<dd>Done.  Script <code/sgml2docs/ provided.  See notes above.

<dt>All HTML files to go in a <code/.htx/ sub-directory;
The document name should not be included in the HTML file names;
The top level HTML file should be <code/index.html/;
Need shorter names for html files;
There should be no links within the <code/.htx/ directory.
<dd>All done.

<dt>Need a fix for line breaks within tags in <code/htx/ index file.
<dd>??
<dt>Findme, showme and hlink should all work.
<dd>??

</dl>

<subsubsubsect>Hyperlinking
<p><dl>
<dt>Must be able to process documents which refer to other starlink
documents which are not available (i.e. allow unresolved FPIs);
Must function in the absence of some (or all) document summaries;
In the absence of referenced documents, the URLs referring to the
unavailable documents should produce standard HTX remote reference 
to the document server at RAL.
<dd>Supported, by making the error-handling code much more
sophisticated.  See above.

<dt>There should be an ID index page at the end of the HTML version,
containing links back to referenced points within the document. Each
page should have a link to the start of its entries in the ID index.
<dd>??

<dt>Keep open the possibility of using document summaries as an option.
For the moment, we will not generate or distribute such summaries (but 
we may change this later).
<dd>Use of document summaries is still the documented way, but I've
added a note that the public identifier can be unresolved without error.

</dl>
  
<subsubsubsect>&latex; Output
<p><dl>
<dt>Everyone to pass commented &latex; output to Mark or Norman.
<dd>Done at meeting.

<dt>Table of contents: move it to the front.
<dd>??

<dt>Look-and-feel: reproduce original &latex; appearance.
<dd>??

<dt>Down-converter should have two flags (defaulting to yes) to indicate
     if each appendix or section should start on a new page.
<dd>??

<dt>Tables: implement alignment, rules, colspan.
<dd>??

<dt>Authors should manually replace tabbing environments within &latex;
documents before running the up-converter. The up-converter should 
issue a warning if it finds a tabbing environment.
<dd>??

<dt>Optional inclusion of section headings in table of contents will not
be supported.
<dd>No action needed.

<dt>Need increased sloppiness in line wrapping.
<dd>??

<dt>Verbatim text (displayed only) needs to be a bit smaller.
<dd>??

</dl>

<subsubsubsect>HTML Appearance
<p><dl>
<dt>Look-and-feel: be guided by ease of implementation, but if possible,
     try to reproduce the current style (for instance, do not specify a
     background colour).
<dd>??

<dt>Navigation buttons: retain the system used by <code/latex2html/.
<dd>??

<dt>Move the abstract off the front page.
<dd>??

<dt>RAL links should be combined into the CCLRC link.
<dd>??

<dt>Down-converter should only add the standard copyright statement
     (available from MJB).
<dd>??

<dt>Hard copy: retrieve .ps files from RAL server.
<dd>??

<dt>Section numbers: keep them in the HTML, but slim down their use in
     the table of contents.
<dd>??

<dt>Alignment of in-line gifs and bitmaps needs to be corrected.
<dd>Done

</dl>
