#
#  <description>
#     This program converts a LaTeX Starlink document into an SGML version
#     of the same thing, conforming to the appropriate SGML DTD (SUN, 
#     SSN, etc).  If a programcode document containing marked up 
#     routine prologues is specified, it will ensure that references
#     to routines therein are handled properly.
#     <p>
#     The upconversion process is somewhat complicated and error-prone
#     for a number of reasons, and some manual intervention is likely
#     to be required to generate an SGML document which conforms
#     to the appropriate DTD, is semantically equivalent to the 
#     LaTeX original, and whose SGML source is clear and maintainable.
#
#  <diytopic><title>Output</title>
#     The program tries to provide as much helpful information about
#     how the conversion has gone as it can.  
#     <p>
#     The first part of the 
#     output to the screen is the result of an invocation of 
#     <code>latex2html</code>, and provides the normal, rather verbose, 
#     output which that generates.
#     <p>
#     Subsequent screen output is restricted to a brief
#     summary of what stage the conversion is currently at.  
#     When conversion is complete (or has encountered a fatal
#     error) a summary is written giving the name, 
#     <em>doc</em><code>.translog</code>, of a log file into
#     which more detailed information has been written.
#     The log file provides line-based reports on items
#     which might need attention.  Here is an example of what it
#     might look like:
#     <verbatim>
#     2:1:     Beginning l2s -> Starlink final SGML transformation
#     2:1:     Verbosity level 5
#     5:26:    Apparently duplicate author initials - using ID `auto.id-auth.1'
#     5:55:    Ignoring line break in element H1
#     4:56:    Eight-bit character &amp;#244; may cause trouble for LaTeX
#                 ...
#     4:368:   Extra info from includegraphics ignored:
#     4:            clip,height=118mm
#     2:377:   References stable - no further passes required
#     2:377:   Ending l2s -> Starlink final SGML transformation
#     </verbatim>
#     The first digit on each line is an integer indicating the severity 
#     of the message, as follows:
#     <dl compact>
#        <dt>0 <dd>fatal
#        <dt>1 <dd>serious
#        <dt>2 <dd>control information
#        <dt>3 <dd>almost certainly requires attention to the 
#                  converted document
#        <dt>4 <dd>probably requires attention to the converted document
#        <dt>5 <dd>can probably be ignored
#        <dt>6 <dd>debugging
#     </dl>
#     The second number is the line number of the output SGML file to which
#     the message refers; if there is no second number the line is a
#     continuation of the message on the previous line.
#     The text on the rest of the line is intended to explain what the
#     problem is, or may be.
#     <p>
#     Finally, the script attempts to parse the resulting document,
#     and reports on whether it conformed to the Starlink DTD.
#     If it failed to conform, the program shows how to use the 
#     <ref id=parse>parse</> command to see the errors.
#     <p>
#     On exit a file <em>doc</em><code>.sgml</code> is left in the
#     current directory.  If conversion has been entirely successful
#     then intermediate files will be removed, but otherwise 
#     some intermediate files will be left since they may be useful
#     for post-mortem analysis and to aid in future runs of the code.
#
#  <diytopic><title>Flags</title>
#     <dl>
#     <dt><code>-R routinesdoc</code></dt>
#     <dd>The argument of the <code>-R</code> flag names a file 
#         containing an SGML programcode document to which the 
#         main SGML document will refer.  
#         A <code>routinelist</code> element referring to this file will
#         be added at the end of the document (note, if this is not the
#         desired place for it you will have to move it by hand), and
#         any references in the LaTeX document to IDs in this file
#         (typically each routine in the file will have an ID
#         with its own name) will become appropriate <code>coderef</code> 
#         elements.
#     </dl>
#
#  <diytopic><title>LaTeX extensions</title>
#     As well as understanding the various extra commands provided by
#     <code>latex2html</code>, this program provides a new command
#     <verbatim>
#        \sgml{}
#     </verbatim>
#     and a new environment
#     <verbatim>
#        \begin{rawsgml} ... \end{rawsgml}
#     </verbatim>
#     for specifying particular SGML to be output at given places in
#     the LaTeX source.  They do what you would expect them to:
#     their contents, after normal expansion of any LaTeX macros,
#     appear in the output SGML document.  Note these are not verbatim-
#     like as far as latex is concerned, so that latex-like markup
#     may get modified, though SGML-like markup should not.
#     These may be useful when defining, or redefining, high-level
#     user LaTeX macros defined in the document.
#
#  <diytopic><title>Internals</title>
#     This program operates in two stages.  First the script
#     <code>l2s.pl</code> is invoked to convert the LaTeX source into
#     SGML conforming to a temporary DTD called `L2S' which preserves 
#     the structure of the original but is rather messy
#     (<code>l2s.pl</code> is a harness for a modified version of
#     <code>latex2html</code>, and suffers from the same deficiencies as
#     that program as well as a few of its own).
#     This produces a file with the extension <code>.l2s</code>.
#     Secondly the script <code>trans.pl</code> is invoked to
#     perform an SGML transformation from text marked up in the
#     L2S DTD to the appropriate Starlink document DTD.
#     This second part is a multiple pass process -- normally the first
#     pass produces badly non-conforming SGML, the second pass produces
#     something nearly right, and after three passes the document is 
#     stable.
#     <p>
#     For long documents, all of these stages may be slow,
#     and it may be possible to speed matters up by not repeating 
#     unnecessary stages.  Therefore the adventurous user may wish to
#     run the <code>l2s.pl</code> and <code>trans.pl</code> scripts by
#     hand, tweaking the intermediate <code>.l2s</code>
#     file in between.  If the first part of the conversion has gone
#     very badly the program may warn that the intermediate 
#     <code>.l2s</code> document fails to conform to the L2S DTD.
#     This is not good news but may not necessarily scupper the rest
#     of the conversion; in any case running the <ref id=parse>parse</> 
#     utility on the <code>.l2s</code> file will show where errors are,
#     and may give a clue about how the original LaTeX can be fixed to
#     prevent the problem.
#
#  <examplelist>
#     <example>
#     latex2sgml sun321.tex
#        <examplenote>
#        The named LaTeX document is converted, and the output written to
#        <code>sun321.sgml</code>.  Progress messages are printed, 
#        including one at the end which says to look in 
#        <code>sun321.translog</code> for detailed warnings about the
#        conversion, and indicates whether the resulting document
#        conforms to the appropriate Starlink DTD.
#     <example>
#     latex2sgml -R routines.sgml sun321.tex
#        <examplenote>
#        In this example the same conversion is done, but with reference
#        to the document <code>routines.sgml</code> which contains the 
#        marked up prologues of the routines which are to be documented in
#        an appendix of the SUN.  Appropriately identified references 
#        (<code>\ref</code> commands) in the text of the SUN will reference
#        into the routines document (they will be translated into 
#        <code>coderef</code> elements).
#
#  <diytopic>Deficiencies
#     <p>Output of the program is by no means perfect; as well as the 
#     (hopefully fixable) <em>Bugs</em> listed separately, the following
#     problems resulting from the conversion are more or less unavoidable, 
#     or at least no fix is planned.  They will have to be tackled by
#     modifying the LaTeX input file of the the SGML output file by hand.
#     <dl>
#     <dt>Tabbing environments
#     <dd>Tabbing environments in the LaTeX original will almost certainly
#         get badly mangled and will have to be recoded as something else
#         (e.g. <code>tabular</code> or <code>verbatim</code> elements).
#     <dt>Ugly LaTeX-notation maths
#     <dd>Maths is embedded in latex notation in the final document 
#         within <code>m</code>, <code>mequation</code> or 
#         <code>meqnarray</code> elements, and should give the same 
#         output as the original.  However, macros defined in the LaTeX
#         (<code>\newcommand</code>s) are expanded before being 
#         put into the output, which can lead to
#         verbose and ugly inline latex-notation source.
#         This can be avoided by removing the definitions of such from 
#         the input document before conversion; the definitions can
#         then be replaced by hand in the output document within
#         <code>mdefs</code> elements.
#     <dt>Latex lengths
#     <dd>Unlike commands, LaTeX lengths are not expanded, so that when
#         a length is reset somewhere in a document and used later, 
#         this setting will be wrong.  This most frequently causes 
#         problems in LaTeX <code>picture</> environments -- a
#         <code>figurecontent</code> element with attribute 
#         <code>notation=latexgraphics</> may come out with 
#         entirely the wrong dimensions.
#         In this case it is necessary to identify by hand where the
#         relevant lengths are set in the LaTeX source and put them
#         into each bit of LaTeX where they are used.
#     <dt>History and author information
#     <dd>The program constructs basic <code>history</> and 
#         <code>authorlist</> elements but doesn't try to be too clever.
#         You may wish to modify these.
#     <dt>Line breaks
#     <dd>The upconverter sometimes makes a poor job of getting
#         line breaks in the right place.
#         It inserts some and removes some near tags, and the result may
#         be ugly.  This might undergo some improvement in future versions.
#         It does <em>not</em> attempt to insert line breaks other than near
#         certain tags, and this can result in overlong lines if 
#         long tags have been inserted.
#     <dt>Garbage in, garbage out
#     <dd>Some LaTeX source which has only ever been processed by 
#         <code>latex2html</> and not by LaTeX (e.g. within an
#         <code>htmlonly</> environment or similar) may not make much 
#         sense; historically <code>latex2html</code> has done the
#         best it can and written non-conforming HTML which browsers
#         will do their best to render,
#         and which may coincidentally look perfectly OK, so that the
#         weirdness of the source has never been noticed (some of the
#         SST macros provide fine examples of this, which case is
#         dealt with explicitly).
#         Other parts may make sense but not in fact look very good in
#         existing <code>star2html</code>'d form.
#         In either case, if the <code>latex2html</code> source 
#         which the upconverter is presented with isn't very good, then 
#         the output will suffer too.
#         You have been warned.
#     </dl>
#
#  <bugs>
#     This program has a number of inadequacies, some of them as a
#     consequence of the underlying <code>latex2html</code> program 
#     and some of its own.  The following are known bugs thought to
#     be within this program, which should get fixed in the future:
#     <ul>
#     <li>Line breaks are occasionally lost or messed up in long 
#         latex-notation math elements.
#     <li>As a consequence of the (necessarily?) complicated way in which
#         the program works out where paragraphs go, it sometimes outputs
#         <code>&lt;p></code> start tags where it should not, e.g. 
#         resulting in empty paragraphs.
#     <li>Some entities -- non-breaking spaces, endashes and emdashes --
#         seem to get mapped erroneously to ordinary spaces and single
#         dashes respectively.
