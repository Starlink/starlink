  \section{What is \TeX 
    MLapis?}
%
  \TeX 
    MLapis translates \TeX 
    ML documents into \TeX{}.\par 
%
  \section{What good is \TeX 
    ML?}
%
  \LaTeX \footnote{\href{http://www.latex-project.org/}{http://www.latex-project.org/}} is very good at a
  number of very tricky things.  These include formatting mathematical
  formulae, laying out out books and articles, typesetting text and tables in
  a pleasing and consistant manner, etc.  However, XML is good at a number of
  things \LaTeX{} is {\em not} so good at, such as being easily parsed and
  translated into a variety of output formats.\par 
%
  Unfortunately, the standard XML transformation system XSL\footnote{\href{http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/}{http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/}} is not powerful enough to
  translate from normal XML formats to \LaTeX{} directly.  So when you use XML
  to edit, store, and distribute your source documents, \TeX 
    ML provides the
  bridge you need to leverage the power of \LaTeX{} when formatting your
  document for the printed page.\par 
%
  The DTD and other documentation about \TeX 
  ML\footnote{\href{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}} is available
  from IBM
  alphaWorks\footnote{\href{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}}.  My interpretation of their software license does not allow
  me to redistribute those materials here.\par

  \section{\TeX 
    MLapis vs. \TeX 
    MLatte}
%
  There is already a \TeX 
    ML-to-\TeX{} translator called \TeX 
    MLatte\footnote{\href{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}{http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml}}, but I
  was completely unable to get it to work.  It's written in Java\footnote{\href{http://java.sun.com/}{http://java.sun.com/}} and the perhaps the runtime engines I
  have around are drastically sub-standard or something, but for whatever
  reason I could not get their tool to run.  Also, the software license for
  \TeX 
    MLatte is rather less community-oriented than the GPL, so I thought a
  new implementation was in order.\par 
%
  \TeX 
    MLapis is written in pure Perl 5 and requires nothing but a standard
  Perl\footnote{\href{http://www.cpan.org/ports/}{http://www.cpan.org/ports/}} interpreter.  It has it's own
  little XML parser built in.  Of course in order for it to be useful you'll
  need at least \LaTeX{} and almost certainly an XSLT processor as well. It was
  written entirely without reference
  to the \TeX 
    MLatte code, which I have never even seen, so there shouldn't
  be any copyright entanglements.  I cannot guarantee that it will produce
  results
  identical to \TeX 
    MLatte, but it has worked well enough for my purposes and
  seems to comply with available specs and examples.\par

  This page documents texmlapis-1.1.tar.gz\footnote{\href{http://bluweb.com/chouser/proj/texmlapis/texmlapis-1.1.tar.gz}{http://bluweb.com/chouser/proj/texmlapis/texmlapis-1.1.tar.gz}},
  but you can always find the latest version at \TeX 
  MLapis\footnote{\href{http://bluweb.com/chouser/proj/texmlapis}{http://bluweb.com/chouser/proj/texmlapis}}.\par
