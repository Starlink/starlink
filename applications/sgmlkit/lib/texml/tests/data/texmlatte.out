  \section*{Some short quotes from Weston}
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item 
   ``My own eyes are no more than scouts on a preliminary search,
   for the camera's eye may entirely change my idea.''
   \item 
   ``Ultimately success of failure in photographing people depends
   on the photographer's ability to understand his fellow man.''
  \end{enumerate}
  \section*{A longer quote}
  \begin{quote}
   ``One does not think during creative work, any more than one thinks
  when driving a car. But one has a background of years - learning,
  unlearning, success, failure, dreaming, thinking, experience, all
  this - then the moment of creation, the focusing of all into the
  moment. So I can make 'without thought,' fifteen carefully
  considered negatives, one every fifteen minutes, given material
  with as many possibilities. But there is all the eyes have seen in
  this life to influence me.''
