      SUBROUTINE WCSMOSAIC( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     WCSMOSAIC

*  Purpose:
*     Tiles a group of NDFs using World Co-ordinate System information.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL WCSMOSAIC( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application aligns and rebins a group of input NDFs into a
*     single output NDF.  It differs from WCSALIGN in both the algorithm
*     used, and in the requirements placed on the input NDFs.  WCSMOSAIC
*     requires that the transformation from pixel to WCS co-ordinates
*     be defined in each input NDF, but (unlike WCSALIGN) the inverse
*     transformation from WCS to pixel co-ordinates need not be defined.
*     For instance, this means that WCSMOSAIC can process data in which
*     the WCS position of each input pixel is defined via a look-up
*     table rather than an analytical expression.  Note however, that
*     the WCS information in the reference NDF (see Parameter REF) must
*     have a defined inverse transformation.
*
*     The WCSMOSAIC algorithm proceeds as follows.  First, the output
*     NDF is filled with zeros.  An associated array of weights (one
*     weight for each output pixel) is created and is also filled with
*     zeros.  Each input NDF is then processed in turn.  For each pixel
*     in the current input NDF, the corresponding transformed position
*     in the output NDF is found (based on the WCS information in both
*     NDFs).  The input pixel value is then divided up between a small
*     group of output pixels centred on this central output position.
*     The method used for choosing the fraction of the input pixel
*     value assigned to each output pixel is determined by the METHOD
*     and PARAMS parameters.  Each of the affected output pixel values
*     is then incremented by its allocated fraction of the input pixel
*     value.  The corresponding weight values are incremented by the
*     fractions used (that is, if 0.25 of an input pixel is assigned to
*     an output pixel, the weight for the output pixel is incremented by
*     0.25).  Once all pixels in the current input NDF have been
*     rebinned into the output NDF in this way, the algorithm proceeds
*     to rebin the next input NDF in the same way.  Once all input NDFs
*     have been processed, output pixels which have a weight less than
*     the value given by Parameter WLIM are set bad.  The output NDF may
*     then optionally (see Parameter NORM) be normalised by dividing it
*     by the weights array.  This normalisation of the output NDF takes
*     account of any difference in the number of pixels contributing to
*     each output pixel, and also removes artefacts which may be
*     produced by aliasing between the input and output pixel grids.
*     Thus each output pixel value is a weighted mean of the input pixel
*     values from which it receives contributions.  This means that the
*     units of the output NDF are the same as the input NDF.  In
*     particular, any difference between the input and output pixel
*     sizes is ignored, resulting in the total input data sum being
*     preserved only if the input and output NDFs have equal pixel\
*     sizes.  However, an option exists to scale the input values before
*     use so that the total data sum in each input NDF is preserved even
*     if the input and output pixel sizes differ (see Parameter
*     CONSERVE).
*
*     If the input NDFs contain variances, then these are propagated to
*     the output.  Alternatively, output variances can be generated from
*     the spread of input values contributing to each output pixel (see
*     Parameter GENVAR). Any input variances can also be used to weight
*     the input data (see Parameter VARIANCE).  By default, all input
*     data is given equal weight. An additional weight for each NDF can be
*     specified using Parameter WEIGHTS.
*
*     The transformations needed to produce alignment are derived from
*     the co-ordinate system information stored in the WCS components of
*     the supplied NDFs.  For each input NDF, alignment is first
*     attempted in the current co-ordinate Frame of the reference NDF.
*     If this fails, alignment is attempted in the current co-ordinate
*     Frame of the input NDF.  If this fails, alignment occurs in the
*     pixel co-ordinate Frame.  A message indicating which Frame
*     alignment was achieved in is displayed.

*  Usage:
*     wcsmosaic in out lbnd ubnd ref

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ACC = _REAL (Read)
*        The positional accuracy required, as a number of pixels.  For
*        highly non-linear projections, a recursive algorithm is used in
*        which successively smaller regions of the projection are
*        fitted with a least-squares linear transformation.  If such a
*        transformation results in a maximum positional error greater
*        than the value supplied for ACC (in pixels), then a smaller
*        region is used.  High accuracy is paid for by longer run times.
*        [0.05]
*     ALIGNREF = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Determines the coordinate system in which each input NDF is
*        aligned with the reference NDF. If TRUE, alignment is performed
*        in the coordinate system described by the current Frame of the WCS
*        FrameSet in the reference NDF. If FALSE, alignment is performed
*        in the coordinate system specified by the following set of WCS
*        attributes in the reference NDF: AlignSystem AlignStdOfRest,
*        AlignOffset, AlignSpecOffset, AlignSideBand, AlignTimeScale. The
*        AST library provides fixed defaults for all these. So for
*        instance, AlignSystem defaults to ICRS for celestial axes and
*        Wavelength for spectral axes, meaning that celestial axes will
*        be aligned in ICRS and spectral axes in wavelength, by default.
*        Similarly, AlignStdOfRest defaults to Heliocentric, meaning that
*        by default spectral axes will be aligned in the Heliocentric rest
*        frame.
*
*        As an example, if you are mosaicking two spectra which both use
*        radio velocity as the current WCS, but which have different rest
*        frequencies, then setting ALIGNREF to TRUE will cause alignment
*        to be performed in radio velocity, meaning that the differences
*        in rest frequency are ignored. That is, a channel with 10 Km/s
*        in the input is mapping onto the channel with 10 km/s in the output.
*        If ALIGNREF is FALSE (and no value has been set for the AlignSystem
*        attribute in the reference WCS), then alignment will be performed
*        in wavelength, meaning that the different rest frequencies cause
*        an additional shift. That is, a channel with 10 Km/s in the input
*        will be mapping onto which ever output channel has the same
*        wavelength, taking into account the different rest frequencies.
*
*        As another example, consider mosaicking two maps which both have
*        (azimuth,elevation) axes. If ALIGNREF is TRUE, then any given
*        (az,el) values in one image will be mapped onto the exact same
*        (az,el) values in the other image, regardless of whether the
*        two images were taken at the same time. But if ALIGNREF is FALSE,
*        then a given (az,el) value in one image will be mapped onto
*        pixel that has the same ICRS coordinates in the other image
*        (since AlignSystem default to ICRS for celestial axes). Thus any
*        different in the observation time of the two images will result
*        in an additional shift.
*
*        As yet another example, consider mosaicking two spectra which are
*        both in frequency with respect to the LSRK, but which refer to
*        different points on the sky. If ALIGNREF is TRUE, then a given
*        LSRK frequency in one spectra will be mapped onto the exact same
*        LSRK frequency in the other image, regardless of the different sky
*        positions. But if ALIGNREF is FALSE, then a given input frequency
*        will first be converted to Heliocentric frequency (the default
*        value for AlignStdOfRest is "Heliocentric"), and will be mapped
*        onto the output channel that has the same Heliocentric frequency.
*        Thus the differecen in sky positions will result in an additional
*        shift.   [FALSE]
*     CONSERVE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If set TRUE, then the output pixel values will be scaled in
*        such a way as to preserve the total data value in a feature on
*        the sky.  The scaling factor is the ratio of the output pixel
*        size to the input pixel size.  This option can only be used if
*        the Mapping is successfully approximated by one or more linear
*        transformations.  Thus an error will be reported if it used
*        when the ACC parameter is set to zero (which stops the use of
*        linear approximations), or if the Mapping is too non-linear to
*        be approximated by a piece-wise linear transformation.  The
*        ratio of output to input pixel size is evaluated once for each
*        panel of the piece-wise linear approximation to the Mapping,
*        and is assumed to be constant for all output pixels in the
*        panel.  This parameter is ignored if the NORM parameter is set
*        FALSE.  [TRUE]
*     FLBND( ) = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        The lower bounds of the bounding box enclosing the output NDF
*        in the current WCS Frame.  The number of elements in this
*        parameter is equal to the number of axes in the current WCS
*        Frame.  Celestial axis values will be in units of radians.
*     FUBND( ) = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        The upper bounds of the bounding box enclosing the output NDF
*        in the current WCS Frame.  The number of elements in this
*        parameter is equal to the number of axes in the current WCS
*        Frame.  Celestial axis values will be in units of radians.
*     GENVAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, output variances are generated based on the spread of
*        input pixel values contributing to each output pixel.  Any
*        input variances then have no effect on the output variances
*        (although input variances will still be used to weight the
*        input data if the VARIANCE parameter is set TRUE).  If GENVAR
*        is set FALSE, the output variances are based on the variances
*        in the input NDFs, so long as all input NDFs contain variances
*        (otherwise the output NDF will not contain any Variances). If a
*        null (!) value is supplied, then a value of FALSE is adopted if
*        and only if all the input NDFs have variance components (TRUE
*        is used otherwise).  [FALSE]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        A group of input NDFs (of any dimensionality).  This should be
*        given as a comma-separated list, in which each list element
*        can be one of the following options.
*
*        - An NDF name, optionally containing wild-cards and/or regular
*        expressions ("*", "?", "[a-z]" etc.).
*
*        - The name of a text file, preceded by an up-arrow character
*        "^".  Each line in the text file should contain a
*        comma-separated list of elements, each of which can in turn be
*        an NDF name (with optional wild-cards, etc.), or another file
*        specification (preceded by an up-arrow).  Comments can be
*        included in the file by commencing lines with a hash character
*        "#".
*
*        If the value supplied for this parameter ends with a hyphen,
*        then you are re-prompted for further input until a value is
*        given which does not end with a hyphen.  All the NDFs given in
*        this way are concatenated into a single group.
*     LBND() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        An array of values giving the lower pixel-index bound on each
*        axis for the output NDF.  The suggested default values just
*        encompass all the input data.  A null value (!) also results in
*        these same defaults being used.  [!]
*     LBOUND() = _INTEGER (Write)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the output NDF. Note, values will be
*        written to this output parameter even if a null value is
*        supplied for Parameter OUT.
*     MAXPIX = _INTEGER (Read)
*        A value which specifies an initial scale size in pixels for the
*        adaptive algorithm which approximates non-linear Mappings with
*        piece-wise linear transformations.  If MAXPIX is larger than
*        any dimension of the region of the output grid being used, a
*        first attempt will be made to approximate the Mapping by a
*        linear transformation over the entire output region.  If a
*        smaller value is used, the output region will first be divided
*        into subregions whose size does not exceed MAXPIX pixels in any
*        dimension, and then attempts will be made at approximation.
*        [1000]
*     METHOD = LITERAL (Read)
*        The method to use when dividing an input pixel value between a
*        group of neighbouring output pixels.  For details on these
*        schemes, see the description of AST_REBINx in SUN/210.  METHOD
*        can take the following values.
*
*        - "Bilinear" -- The input pixel value is divided bi-linearly
*        between  the four nearest output pixels.  This produces
*        smoother output NDFs than the nearest-neighbour scheme, but is
*        marginally slower.
*
*        - "Nearest" -- The input pixel value is assigned completely to
*        the single nearest output pixel.
*
*        - "Sinc" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x) kernel, where x is the pixel
*        offset from the transformed input pixel centre, and
*        sinc(z)=sin(z)/z.  Use of this scheme is not recommended.
*
*        - "SincSinc" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x)sinc(k*pi*x) kernel.  This
*        is a valuable general-purpose scheme, intermediate in its
*        visual effect on NDFs between the bilinear and
*        nearest-neighbour schemes.
*
*        - "SincCos" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x)cos(k*pi*x) kernel.  It gives
*        similar results to the "Sincsinc" scheme.
*
*        - "SincGauss" -- Uses the sinc(pi*x)exp(-k*x*x) kernel.  Good
*        results can be obtained by matching the FWHM of the
*        envelope function to the point-spread function of the
*        input data (see Parameter PARAMS).
*
*        - "Somb" -- Uses the somb(pi*x) kernel, where
*        somb(z)=2*J1(z)/z  (J1 is the first-order Bessel function of
*        the first kind).  This scheme is similar to the "Sinc" scheme.
*
*        - "SombCos" -- Uses the somb(pi*x)cos(k*pi*x) kernel.  This
*        scheme is similar to the "SincCos" scheme.
*
*        - "Gauss" -- Uses the exp(-k*x*x) kernel.  The FWHM of the
*        Gaussian is given by Parameter PARAMS(2), and the point at
*        which to truncate the Gaussian to zero is given by Parameter
*        PARAMS(1).
*
*        All methods propagate variances from input to output, but the
*        variance estimates produced by schemes other than
*        nearest neighbour need to be treated with care since the
*        spatial smoothing produced by these methods introduces
*        correlations in the variance estimates.  Also, the degree of
*        smoothing produced varies across the NDF.  This is because a
*        sample taken at a pixel centre will have no contributions from
*        the neighbouring pixels, whereas a sample taken at the corner
*        of a pixel will have equal contributions from all four
*        neighbouring pixels, resulting in greater smoothing and lower
*        noise.  This effect can produce complex Moire patterns in the
*        output variance estimates, resulting from the interference of
*        the spatial frequencies in the sample positions and in the
*        pixel-centre positions.  For these reasons, if you want to use
*        the output variances, you are generally safer using
*        nearest-neighbour interpolation.  The initial default is
*        "SincSinc".  [current value]
*     NORM = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        In general, each output pixel contains contributions from
*        multiple input pixel values, and the number of input pixels
*        contributing to each output pixel will vary from pixel to
*        pixel.  If NORM is set TRUE (the default), then each output
*        value is normalised by dividing it by the number of
*        contributing input pixels, resulting in each output value being
*        the weighted mean of the contibuting input values.  However, if
*        NORM is set FALSE, this normalisation is not applied.  See also
*        Parameter CONSERVE.  Setting NORM to FALSE and VARIANCE to TRUE
*        results in an error being reported.  [TRUE]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The output NDF.  If a null (!) value is supplied, WCSMOSAIC
*        will terminate early without creating an output cube, but
*        without reporting an error. Note, the pixel bounds which the
*        output cube would have had will still be written to output
*        Parameters LBOUND and UBOUND, even if a null value is supplied
*        for OUT.
*     PARAMS( 2 ) = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        An optional array which consists of additional parameters
*        required by the Sinc, SincSinc, SincCos, SincGauss, Somb,
*        SombCos, and Gauss methods.
*
*        PARAMS( 1 ) is required by all the above schemes.  It is used
*        to specify how many output pixels on either side of the central
*        output pixel are to receive contribution from the corresponding
*        input pixel.  Typically, a value of 2 is appropriate and the
*        minimum allowed value is 1 (i.e. one pixel on each side).  A
*        value of zero or fewer indicates that a suitable number of
*        pixels should be calculated  automatically.  [0]
*
*        PARAMS( 2 ) is required only by the Gauss, SombCos, SincSinc,
*        SincCos, and SincGauss schemes. For the SombCos, SincSinc and
*        SincCos schemes, it specifies the number of output pixels at
*        which the envelope of the function goes to zero.  The minimum
*        value is 1.0, and the run-time default value is 2.0.  For the
*        Gauss and SincGauss scheme, it specifies the full-width at
*        half-maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian envelope measured in
*        output pixels.  The minimum value is 0.1, and the run-time
*        default is 1.0.  []
*     REF = NDF (Read)
*        The NDF to which all the input NDFs are to be aligned.  If a
*        null value is supplied for this parameter, the first NDF
*        supplied for Parameter IN is used.  The WCS information in this
*        NDF must have a defined inverse transformation (from WCS
*        co-ordinates to pixel co-ordinates).  [!]
*     UBND() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        An array of values giving the upper pixel-index bound on each
*        axis for the output NDF.  The suggested default values just
*        encompass all the input data.  A null value (!) also results in
*        these same defaults being used.  [!]
*     UBOUND() = _INTEGER (Write)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the output NDF. Note, values will be
*        written to this output parameter even if a null value is
*        supplied for Parameter OUT.
*     VARIANCE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, then any input VARIANCE components in the input NDFs
*        are used to weight the input data (the weight used for each
*        data value is the reciprocal of the variance).  If FALSE, all
*        input data is given equal weight.  Note, some applications
*        (such as CCDPACK:MAKEMOS) use a parameter named USEVAR to
*        determine both whether input variances are used to weights
*        input data values, and also how to calculate output variances.
*        However, WCSMOSAIC uses the VARIANCE parameter only for the
*        first of these purposes (determining whether to weight the
*        input data).  The second purpose (determining how to create
*        output variances) is fulfilled by the GENVAR parameter. [FALSE]
*     WEIGHTS = LITERAL (Read)
*        An optional group of numerical weights, one for each of the input
*        NDFs specified by Parameter IN. If VARIANCE is TRUE, the weight
*        assigned to each input pixel is the value supplied in this group
*        correspoinding to the appropriate input NDF, divided by the variance
*        of the pixel value. An error is reported if the number of supplied
*        weights does not equal the number of supplied input NDFs. [!]
*     WLIM = _REAL (Read)
*        This parameter specifies the minimum number of good pixels
*        that must contribute to an output pixel for the output pixel
*        to be valid.  Note, fractional values are allowed.  If a value
*        less than 1.0E-10 is supplied, a value of 1.0E-10 is used.
*        [1.0E-10]

*  Examples:
*     wcsmosaic m51* mosaic lbnd=! accept
*        This example rebins all the NDFs with names starting with
*        the string "m51" in the current directory so that they are
*        aligned with the first input NDF, and combines them all into a
*        single output NDF called mosaic.  The output NDF is just big
*        enough to contain all the pixels in all the input NDFs.

*  Notes:
*     -  WCS information (including the current co-ordinate Frame) is
*     propagated from the reference NDF to the output NDF. All other
*     information is propagated form the first input NDF.
*     -  The QUALITY and AXIS components are not propagated from input
*     to output.
*     -  There are different facts reported, their verbosity depending
*     on the current message-reporting level set by environment variable
*     MSG_FILTER.  If this is set to QUIET, no information will be
*     displayed while the command is executing.  When the filtering
*     level is at least as verbose as NORMAL, the interpolation method
*     being used will be displayed.  If set to VERBOSE, the name of each
*     input NDF will also be displayed as it is processed.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: WCSFRAME, WCSALIGN, REGRID; CCDPACK: TRANNDF.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the DATA, VARIANCE, LABEL,
*     TITLE, UNITS, WCS, and HISTORY components of the input NDFs (see
*     the METHOD parameter for notes on the interpretation of output
*     variances).
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  All non-complex numeric data types can be handled, but the data
*     type will be converted to one of _INTEGER, _DOUBLE or _REAL for
*     processing.

*  History:
*     14-SEP-2005 (DSB):
*        Original version, based on WCSALIGN.
*     30-MAR-2006 (DSB):
*        Added ILEVEL.
*     2006 April 12 (MJC):
*        Remove unused variables.
*     8-JAN-2007 (DSB):
*        Modified the prologue to clarify the need for an inverse
*        WCS transformation in the reference NDF.
*     8-FEB-2007 (DSB):
*        Added Parameters LBOUND and UBOUND.
*     13-FEB-2007 (DSB):
*        Remove C-like semi-colon line terminators.
*     13-MAR-2007 (DSB):
*        Add Parameter VARWGT.
*     29-MAR-2007 (DSB):
*        Renamed Parameter VARWGT as USEVAR. Internally, the flag is
*        still refered to as varwgt for consistency with AST (which has
*        both AST__USEVAR and AST__VARWGT flags).
*     2007 April 4 (MJC):
*        Renamed USEVAR to the KAPPA standard of VARIANCE.
*     4-MAY-2007 (DSB):
*        Add new argument NUSED to calls to AST_REBINSEQ.
*     19-JUN-2007 (DSB):
*        New output Parameters FLBND and FUBND.
*     4-FEB-2008 (DSB):
*        Allow a null value to be supplied for Parameter GENVAR.
*     23-JUN-2008 (DSB):
*        Propagate from the first input NDF rather than the reference
*        NDF.
*     2009 July 22 (MJC):
*        Remove ILEVEL parameter and use the current reporting level
*        instead (set by the global MSG_FILTER environment variable).
*     30-AUG-2012 (DSB):
*        Added Parameters CONSERVE and NORM.
*     1-DEC-2014 (DSB):
*        Added Parameter ALIGNREF.
*     9-MAR-2018 (DSB):
*        Added Parameter WEIGHTS.
