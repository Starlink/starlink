#  Name:
#     kappa_style.def

#  Purpose:
#     An example of a file containing a description of a coloured
#     plotting style which can be used for day-to-day work by KAPPA
#     graphical application.

#  Description:
#     KAPPA graphical applications such as CONTOUR, DISPLAY, etc, allow
#     the appearance of certain parts of the plot (annotated axes,
#     contours, keys, etc) to be specified using a text file containing
#     settings for plotting attributes. The name of such a file can be
#     supplied for the relevant application parameter. For instance, the
#     STYLE parameter is usually used to specify the appearance of
#     annotated axes.
#
#     This file is an example of the way in which this facility can be
#     used. It contains general settings which could be applicable for
#     any data plot. Data-specific versions could be produced by editing
#     copies of this file to include such things as the title to be
#     displayed at the top of the plot (using the Title attribute), or
#     the format for numerical axis labels (using the Format or Digits
#     attributes).

#  Example:
#     display style=$KAPPA_DIR/style.def
#        This runs the DISPLAY application, creating annotated axes with
#        the appearance specified in this file. Note, subsequent
#        invocations of DISPLAY will use the same file until a new value
#        is assigned to parameter STYLE. Most style parameters within
#        KAPPA work in this way. If the user has write access to the
#        specified file, then it could be edited between invocations
#        of DISPLAY to produce different plotting styles.

#  Notes:
#     -  Always include attribute axis qualifiers, etc, explcitly in this
#     file.  For instance, say "textlab(1)=1" and "textlab(2)=1" instead of
#     just "textlab=1".

#  Set values for attributes synonyms recognised by individual applications:
#  =========================================================================

#  CONTOUR:
      colour(contour)=yellow

#  MLINPLOT:
      size(zeromark)=1.5
      colour(zeromark)=red
      size(labels)=0.7
      size(errbars)=0.1
      colour(labels)=red
      labpos(left)=0.05
      labpos(right)=1.01


#  Set values for general attributes recognised by all applications:
#  =================================================================

#  Speed up plotting of borders, grids, etc, by reducing the Tol attribute.
      tol=0.002

#  Always draw a border around the regions of the plot containing
#  valid co-ordinates. Make it twice wider the default width.
      border=1
      width(border)=2.0

#  Include textual labels describing the axes.
      textlab(1)=1
      textlab(2)=1

#  Set colours for various elements of the plot.
      colour(border)=blue
      colour(grid)=green
      colour(ticks)=green
      colour(numlab)=cyan
      colour(axes)=green

#  Set the size of the text to use for numerical and textual axis labels.
#  These are slightly smaller than the default sizes of 1.0.
      size(numlab)=0.8
      size(textlab)=0.9

#  Set the gaps between the axes and the associated textual labels. The default
#  is 0.01.
      textlabgap(1)=0.05
      textlabgap(2)=0.05

#  Make the ticks marks (both major and minor) longer. The defaults are
#  0.015 for major ticks and 0.007 for minor ticks.
      majticklen(1)=0.02
      majticklen(2)=0.02
      minticklen(1)=0.01
      minticklen(2)=0.01
