  <description>SST - A Simple Software Tools Package</description>
  <abstract><p>SST is now considered obsolete; it is included to
      support those applications which currently use it, but it should
      not be used for new code.</p>
    <p>The Simple Software Tools package (SST) is a package of
      applications designed to help with the production of software
      and documentation, with particular emphasis on ADAM programming
      using Fortran 77.</p>
    <p>As its name suggests, SST is intended for performing fairly
      simple manipulation of software, but it aims to tackle some of
      the commonly encountered problems which are not catered for in
      more sophisticated commercial software tools (such as FORCHECK
      and VAXset) which are available on Starlink. In future, SST may
      also duplicate a few of the simpler facilities which commercial
      products offer in order to avoid the cost (and generally much
      higher overheads, such as disk space) which prevent the
      commercial products being freely available on all Starlink
      machines. </p></abstract>
