#  Name:
#     CATREMOTE
#  Purpose:
#     A simple script to query remote catalogues.
#  Language:
#     Perl 5.
#  Type of Module:
#     Perl script (with interaction via the command-line).
#  Description:
#     catremote is a tool for querying remote astronomical catalogues,
#     databases and archives via the Internet.  It allows remote
#     catalogues to be queried and the resulting table saved as a local
#     file written in the Tab-Separated Table (TST) format.  It also
#     provides a number of related auxiliary functions.
#
#     catremote has several different modes of usage, each providing a
#     different function.  The modes are:
#
#     list    - list the catalogues currently available,
#
#     details - show details of a named catalogue,
#
#     query   - submit a query to a remote catalogue and retrieve the results,
#
#     name    - resolve an object name into coordinates,
#
#     help    - list the modes available.
#
#     There is an introduction to using catremote in SUN/190 and it is
#     comprehensively documented in SSN/76.
#  Usage:
#     Arguments for catremote can be specified on the command line.
#     If arguments other than the first are omitted then they will usually
#     be prompted for.  The first argument is the mode of operation and
#     its value determines the other arguments which are required.  The
#     arguments for the various modes are:
#
#      catremote list    server-type
#
#      catremote details db-name
#
#      catremote query   db-name alpha delta radius additional-condition
#
#      catremote name    db-name object-name
#
#      catremote help
#
#     The individual arguments are described in the `Arguments' section.
#     If the mode is omitted then  'help' mode is assumed.
#
#     In addition to the command-line arguments, catremote takes some
#     input from Unix shell environment variables and these variables can
#     be used to control its behaviour.
#  Arguments:
#     mode (read)
#        The mode in which catremote is to be used.  One of: list,
#        details, query, name or help.
#     server-type (read)
#        The server type of the catalogues to be listed in 'list' mode.
#        One of: all, catalog, archive, namesvr, imagesvr, local or
#        directory.  See SSN/76 for further details.
#     db-name (read)
#        The name of the remote catalogue (or database) to be queried.
#     alpha (read)
#        The Central Right Ascension of the query.  The value should be
#        for equinox J2000 and given in sexagesimal hours with a colon
#        (':') as the separator.  For example: 12:30:00.
#     delta (read)
#        The central Declination of the query.  The value should be for
#        equinox J2000 and given in sexagesimal degrees with a colon (':')
#        as the separator.  Southern Declinations are negative.  For
#        example: 30:23:00.
#     radius (read)
#        The radius of the query in minutes of arc.
#     additional-condition (read)
#        Any additional condition applied to the query.  Catalogues vary
#        in which, if any, additional queries they support.  See SSN/76
#        for further details.
#     object-name (read)
#        The name of an astronomical object which is to be resolved when
#        catremote is being used in 'name' mode.  It should be entered
#        without embedded spaces.  The case of letters (upper or lower) is
#        not usually significant.  That is, case is not significant for
#        the usual name resolver database, simbad_ns@eso, and probably
#        will not be significant for other name resolvers.  For example:
#        NGC3379.
#  Environment Variables:
#     CATREM_URLREADER (read)
#        catremote uses a separate program to submit the URL constituting
#        a query to the server and return the table of results.  This
#        environment variable specifies the program to be used.  See
#        SSN/76 for further details.  (Mandatory.)
#
#     CATREM_CONFIG (read)
#        This environment variable specifies the configuration file to be
#        used.  It should be set to either the URL (for a remote file) or
#        the local file name, including a directory specification (for a
#        local file).  Configuration files mediate the interaction between
#        catremote and the remote catalogue; see SSN/76 for further
#        details.  (Mandatory.)
#
#     CATREM_MAXOBJ (read)
#        The maximum number of objects which the returned table is allowed
#        to contain.
#
#     CATREM_ECHOURL (read)
#        This environment controls whether the URL representing the query
#        submitted to the remote catalogue is also displayed to the user.
#        The default is 'no'; to see the URL set CATREM_ECHOURL to 'yes'.
#        Seeing the URL is potentially useful when debugging configuration
#        files and remote catalogue servers but is not usually required
#        for normal operation.
#  Examples:
#     catremote
#     catremote help
#        List the various modes in which catremote may be used.
#     catremote list
#        List all the catalogues and databases in the current configuration
#        file.
#     catremote list namesvr
#        List all the name servers (that is, databases of server type
#        'namesvr') in the current configuration file.
#     catremote details usno@eso
#        Show details of the USNO PMM astrometric catalogue (whose name
#        is 'usno@eso').
#     catremote query usno@eso 12:15:00 30:30:00 10
#        Find all the objects in the USNO PMM which lie within ten minutes
#        of arc of Right Ascension 12:15:00.0 (sexagesimal hours) and
#        Declination 30:30:00.0 (sexagesimal degrees, both J2000).  The
#        objects selected will be saved as a catalogue called
#        usno_eso_121500_303000.tab created in your current directory.
#        This catalogue will be written in the Tab-Separated Table (TST)
#        format.
#     catremote query usno@eso 12:15:00 30:30:00 10 14,16
#        Find all the objects in the USNO PMM which lie within ten minutes
#        of arc of Right Ascension 12:15:00.0 (sexagesimal hours) and
#        Declination 30:30:00.0 (sexagesimal degrees, both J2000) which
#        also lie in the magnitude range 14 to 16.
#     catremote name simbad_ns@eso ngc3379
#        Find the equatorial coordinates of the galaxy NGC 3379.  The
#        coordinates returned are for equinox J2000.
