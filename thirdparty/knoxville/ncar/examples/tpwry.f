C PURPOSE                TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION OF
C                        ENTRY PWRITY OF PWRITY AND
C                        TO TEST PWRITY ON A SIMPLE PROBLEM

C                        IN ADDITION, ONE FRAME CONTAINING
C                        CHARACTER STRING PLOTS IS PRODUCED ON THE
C                        MACHINE GRAPHICS DEVICE.  IN ORDER TO
C                        DETERMINE WHETHER THE TEST WAS SUCCESSFUL,
C                        IT IS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THIS PLOT.
