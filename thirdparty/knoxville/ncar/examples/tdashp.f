C                        IN ADDITION, ONE FRAME CONTAINING THE
C                        DASHED LINE PLOT IS PRODUCED ON THE
C                        MACHINE GRAPHICS DEVICE.  TO DETERMINE
C                        IF THE TEST IS SUCCESSFUL, IT IS NECESSARY

C                        VECTD, LASTD, LINED AND CURVED TO
C                        DRAW FIVE CURVES ON ONE PICTURE USING
C                        FIVE DIFFERENT DASHSMTH PATTERNS.  EACH
C                        CURVE IS CENTERED ABOUT SOLID AXIS LINES AND
C                        LABELLED WITH THE CHARACTER REPRESENTATION OF
