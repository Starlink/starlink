C                        THE USER'S VOLUME, AND TO INDICATE THE

C                        NEXT, THE VOLUME PERIMETERS AND ASSOCIATED
C                        TICK MARKS ARE DRAWN BY CALLS TO PERIM3.
C                        THEN THE LINES ARE DRAWN.  THESE ARE
C                        CERTAIN LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES OF A
