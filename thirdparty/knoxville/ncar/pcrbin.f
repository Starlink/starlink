      PROGRAM PCRBIN
C
C Because of the difficulty of porting a binary file, the database
C for the  PWRITX  package is supplied on the distribution tape in
C the four card-image files
C
C   PWRITXC1
C   PWRITXC2
C   PWRITXD1
C   PWRITXD2
C
C PWRITX  uses a binary file as its database.  This program (PCRBIN),
C converts the four card-image files mentioned above into one binary
C file having four records.
C
C After  PCRBIN  has created the desired binary file, it calls two
C short test routines to make sure thae accessing of all records
C works correctly.  A message is printed as to the success or
C failure of the test routines.
C
C This program uses the support routines  ISHIFT, IAND, and IOR which
C are required locally-implemented support routines for the NCAR
C GKS package.  Also, the entry  SETER  of the error package ERPRT77
C is invoked.
C
C Before executing PCRBIN the implementation-dependent canstants in
C the BLOCKDATA DPORT must be set.  Also, make the four files
C PWRITXC1, PWRITXC2, PWRITXD1, and PWRITXD2 available on the
C units specified in BLOCKDATA DPORT.  Ready the unit specified
C in BLOCKDATA DPORT to recieve the created binary output file
C (the file which will ultimately be used by PWRITX.)
