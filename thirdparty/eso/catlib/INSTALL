Installing the Skycat/RTD/Catlib Software
-----------------------------------------

The configure script and Makefile in this directory can be used to
build any or all of the following packages:

	tclutil      - Tcl and C++ Utilities Package
	astrotcl     - Astronomical Tcl and C++ Utilities
	rtd          - Real-Time Display 
 	cat          - Catalog library
	skycat       - The ESO Skycat Tool


1. Requirements
---------------

One of the following Tcl environments should be installed:

For Tcl7.6:
	itcl2.2    - [Incr Tcl], includes tcl7.6, tk4.2
	BLT2.1     - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX7.6.0  - Extended Tcl

Or for Tcl8.0 (TclPro-1.2):
	Tcl8.0.5   - Tcl Shell  (*** NOTE: bug in init.tcl, see below)
	Tk8.0.5    - Tk Toolkit
	itcl3.0.1  - [Incr Tcl]
	BLT2.4g    - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX8.0.4  - Extended Tcl

Or for Tcl8.2 (TclPro-1.3):
	Tcl8.2.3   - Tcl Shell
	Tk8.2.3    - Tk Toolkit
	itcl3.1.0  - [Incr Tcl]
	BLT2.4o    - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX8.2.0  - Extended Tcl (*** NOTE: see below for possible problems)

Or for Tcl8.3 (TclPro-1.4):
	Tcl8.3.3   - Tcl Shell
	Tk8.3.3    - Tk Toolkit
	itcl3.2    - [Incr Tcl]
	BLT2.4u    - BLT toolkit, graphs and other widgets 
	tclX8.3    - Extended Tcl

These packages are available from the TCL archives: 
  http://www.scriptics.com/

Note the former Scriptics (now Ajuba) product TclPro, which is used to
make the Skycat single binary version, is now free.  See
http://www.scriptics.com/software/tclpro/ for download information.

You can install the standard Tcl/Tk packages anywhere, however it is
easiest to install them all in the same directory (using the same
-prefix argument to configure).

Special Notes:
-------------

* There is a bug in the tcl8.0.5 init.tcl script (also in tclpro-1.2).
  See bug# 1481 at www.scriptics.com for a description and patch. This
  bug causes problems generating the tclIndex files for Itcl
  classes. The skycat configure scripts do this automatically, so you
  will need this patch if you are using tcl-8.0.5.

* I had to fix a few TclX8.2.0 bugs under SuSE Linux-6.3: I had to
  edit tclxConfig.sh in the install dir and remove extra "-L ", which
  caused the following library name to be ignored. I also had to edit
  the source file tclX8.2.0/unix/Common.mk to remove extra reference to
  -lieee, which caused a linker error under SuSe-Linux-6.3.

* If you are building with Scriptics TclPro, you also need a
  "normal" Tcl8.x installation (installed from the source). The Skycat
  configure scripts depend on the $prefix/lib/tclConfig.sh and related
  files being installed.  These files are not currently part of the
  TclPro installation. Also, the names of some of the libraries are
  different in TclPro. Skycat uses the "prowrap" application and the
  Scriptics libraries to build a single binary version for tcl8.x, if
  they are found.

* In order to build a "single binary" version of skycat correctly,
  the static ".a" Tcl/Tk libraries must be installed. 


2. Building the Software
------------------------

Optionally define the environment variable TCLTK_ROOT to point to the
top level install directory for Tcl (for example, /usr/local):

	% setenv TCLTK_ROOT /usr/local              # for csh, tcsh

or:     
	% TCLTK_ROOT=/usr/local; export TCLTK_ROOT  # for sh, ksh, bash

To compile the sources, type the following from the top level directory:

	% configure -prefix $INSTALLDIR --with-gcc
	% make all
	% make install

$INSTALLDIR should be the name of the top level directory (such as
/usr/local or $PWD/install) in which to install the software. The
default install directory is /usr/local.

The configure option --with-gcc says to use GNU gcc and g++.
If you want to use CC and cc instead, specify the --with-cc option:

	% configure -prefix $INSTALLDIR --with-cc

If you prefer using shared libraries and loadable Tcl modules
add the option:

	--enable-shared

Note that if you are using g++, you must also have libg++ compiled as
a shared library for this to work (libg++-2.7.2.x also has the 
"--enable-shared" option). Also, if you use --enable-shared, both
static and shared libraries will be generated, otherwise only the
static versions.

3. If you run into Problems...
------------------------------

The top level configure script actually runs "configure" in each of
the package subdirectories found (tclutil, astrotcl, rtd, cat, and
skycat).  If there are errors, you might try to run configure and make
manually in a subdirectory. As an alternative to configure, you can
also use one of the scripts config.debug, config.shared, etc, which do
the same thing, but with different options. You might want to copy one
of the scripts and edit it first, to set the install directory or
other options. See the */README and */INSTALL files for more
information.

- Solaris cc

  On Solaris, make sure the correct C compiler is being used
  (not /usr/ucb/cc). We have tested with Solaris SunPRO CC/cc
  and gcc (2.95.3).

- HP-UX message "out of memory"

   ON HP-UX: If you get the message "not enough memory" when running
   skycat with shared libraries, it doesn't necessarily mean that you
   have to buy more memory. This is the informative message that HP
   prints when there is an undefined symbol in a shared library....

   One way to find out what the symbol is, is to compile and use this
   little program with the C++ compiler: (I got this from Peter
   Biereichel): 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <dl.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdio.h>
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  shl_t handle;
  handle = shl_load(argv[1], BIND_IMMEDIATE | BIND_VERBOSE, 0L);
  if (handle == 0)
    {
    printf("shl_load failed %s\n", argv[1]);
    perror("");
    }
  else
    printf("shl_load ok\n");
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   For example: % g++ shlload.C -o g++ shlload
                % shlload librtd.sl
                % shlload libcat.sl

   shlload should report the name of the undefined symbol
   in the given shared library.
