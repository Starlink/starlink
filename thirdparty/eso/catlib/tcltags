# "rexp" is an array of regular expressions.  Each must have exactly one
# parenthesized subexpression, which should match the tag exactly.
# The array indices are unimportant.  The regexp as a whole should
# match the line containing the tag, up to the tag but not past it.
#
# Bogus quoting gyrations because Tcl regexps interpret \t as
# "t" and not TAB.
