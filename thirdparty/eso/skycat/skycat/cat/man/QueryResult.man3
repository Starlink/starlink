DESCRIPTION
This class manages the result of an AstroCatalog::query. The basic
result is a char buffer that contains one row per line where each
column is separated by a tab character. Since this is the same format
as a local catalog, this class is also used to implement local
catalogs (see LocalCatalog).

This class provides transparent access to the result based on a
row,column index and allows for type conversion from string to the
desired type.

This class is the same as class TabTable (the parent class), except
that it assumes the table has at least the 3 columns "id", "ra" and
"dec", if World Coordinates are supported, or "id", "x" and "y" if
image coordinates are being used.  This class adds methods to get the
position for a row and to search in an circle, given the center
position and radius. The class keeps a pointer to a catalog config
entry that may be based on the original catalog entry or may be read
from the header of the local catalog or query results.  World
Coordinates are assumed if the entry indicates that ra and dec columns
are present.

UNITS
Unless otherwise stated, the units for all radius values are in arcmin
for World Coordinates and image pixels otherwise..  Floating point
values for RA and DEC are always in degrees. The default equinox is
J2000.

PUBLIC METHODS

QueryResult()
QueryResult(const char* result) 
QueryResult(int numCols, char** colNames, const char* result)
	The constructors have the same arguments as for the parent
	class TabTable.  They initialize the table from a buffer in
	tab table format. See the TabTable constructors for
	details.

getPos(int row, WorldCoords& pos)
getPos(int row, WorldOrImageCoords& pos)
	Get the world coordinate or image pixel position for the given
	row from the columns "ra" and "dec", or "x" and "y", depending
	on the settings in the catalog config entry. By default the
	first 3 fields are: id, ra, dec, in J2000. Keywords in the
	catalog config entry may override these settings. The return
	value if 0 unless errors are detected.

query(const AstroQuery& q, const char* infile, const char* outfile, 
      int& more)

	Query the given tab table file using the condition described
	by the given AstroQuery object.

	Args:
	    q -        (in)   object describing the query

	    infile   - (in)   file to search
	    outfile  - (in)   optional filename to hold results, or null

	    more   -   (out)  set to 1 if more objects would be available 
                              but were not returned because q.maxRows was 
                              set lower

	The return value 0 if all is OK. The number found is available
	as this->numRows().

entry(e, result)
	Set the catalog config entry for this object. This is included
	in the file when this object is saved as a local catalog. The
	optional result arg may be a pointer to the result of a
	catalog query, which may contain config configuration
	information. If specified, it is scanned to update the entry
	with the new information.

symbol()
id_col()
ra_col()
dec_col()
x_col()
y_col()
equinox()
	All these methods return the corresponding values from the
	catalog config entry for the query results. This may be the
	same as for the catalog being searched or may have been
	modified by config information in the header of the query
	results or local catalog.

isWcs()
	Returns true if the query results contain ra and dec columns
	for World Coordinate support.
