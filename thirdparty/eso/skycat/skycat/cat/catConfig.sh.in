# catConfig.sh --
# 
# This shell script (for sh) is generated automatically by Cat's
# configure script.  It will create shell variables for most of
# the configuration options discovered by the configure script.
# This script is intended to be included by the configure scripts
# for Cat extensions so that they don't have to figure this all
# out for themselves.  This file does not duplicate information
# already provided by tclConfig.sh, so you may need to use that
# file in addition to this one.
#
# The information in this file is specific to a single platform.

# Cat's version number.
cat_VERSION='@PACKAGE_VERSION@'

# The name of the Cat library:
cat_LIB_FILE=@cat_LIB_FILE@

# String to pass to linker to pick up the Cat library from its
# build directory.
cat_BUILD_LIB_SPEC='@cat_BUILD_LIB_SPEC@'

# Cat build directory.
cat_BUILD_DIR='@cat_BUILD_DIR@'

# String to pass to linker to pick up the Cat library from its
# installed directory.
cat_LIB_SPEC='@cat_LIB_SPEC@'

# Location of the top-level source directories from which Cat
# was built.  This is the directory that contains generic, unix, etc.
# If Cat was compiled in a different place than the directory
# containing the source files, this points to the location of the sources,
# not the location where Cat was compiled.
cat_SRC_DIR='@cat_SRC_DIR@'

# List of object files used to build the library (for merging packages).
cat_PKG_OBJECTS='@cat_PKG_OBJECTS@'
