CHANGES to Skycat Release
-------------------------

This file contains a list of overall changes to the Skycat software
and user interface. The latest changes are at the top.

See also the CHANGES files in the tclutil, astrotcl, rtd, cat and
skycat directories for changes specific to those packages.

--------------- 04.04.05 released skycat-2.7.4 -----------------

* Merged in RTD changes from Peter Biereichel

* Minor bug fixes and testing with latest compilers

--------------- 20.01.03 released skycat-2.7.3 -----------------

* Ported to gcc-3.2.1 and Tcl-8.4.1:
  Changed the syntax for standard #include files from:
  <file.h> to <file> (for C++) and <cfile> for C.
  
  For example: changed <iostream.h> to <iostream> and
  change <stdio.h> to <cstdio>.

  The Standard C++ Header files are:

     algorithm bitset complex deque exception fstream functional
     iomanip ios iosfwd iostream istream iterator limits list locale map
     memory new numeric ostream queue set sstream stack stdexcept streambuf
     typeinfo utility valarray vector

  The Standard C Header files are:
 
     assert ctype errno float iso646 limits locale math setjmp signal
     stdarg stddef stdio stdlib string time


* Added std:: namespace prefix to all standard C++ names.
  (For example: std::iostream, std::string, std::list, std::endl).

--------------- 27.02.02 released skycat-2.7.2 -----------------

* Fixed problem with temporary downloaded image files being deleted too soon.
  (Now they are only deleted after they are loaded, so that the OS can delete
   them later on.)

--------------- 13.12.01 released skycat-2.7.1 -----------------

* Enabled WCS coordinate conversion outside of the image area (by request).

* fixed problem with equinox syntax reported by David Terrett.

--------------- 27.08.01 released skycat-2.7 -----------------

* Merged in rtd and catalog changes from Peter Biereichel.

* Fixed the -float_panel and -panel_orient options as well as the
  show/hide control panel menu item.

* Included IWidgets in the skycat single binary version (used by
  the new FITS header viewer).

--------------- 22.08.01 released skycat-2.6.10 -----------------

* Fixed a bug that caused skycat to access data outside
  the image array for some (very small) images, which could
  cause the application to crash or display incorrect values.

--------------- 30.07.01 released skycat-2.6.9 -----------------

* Fixed problem with X shared memory, ssh and X11 forwarding:
  (X shm areas are not freed, so don't use them in this case)

--------------- 20.06.01 released skycat-2.6.8 -----------------

* Fixed problem selecting catalog symbols in tk8.3.x

--------------- 18.05.01 released skycat-2.6.7 -----------------

* Ported to tcl8.3.3 (still compatible with earlier versions).

--------------- 11.05.01 released skycat-2.6.6 -----------------

* Fix for displaying multi-extension FITS images (see rtd/CHANGES)

--------------- 17.02.01 released skycat-2.6.5 -----------------

* Fixed a bug converting coordinates between deg and wcs using the rtd
  tcl subcommand "convert".

* Fixed a minor bug that occurred when a catalog config entry had a copyright
  field but no x,y or ra,dec columns defined.

--------------- 09.11.00 released skycat-2.6.4 -----------------

* Fixed a bug that occurred when attempting to load an image file that
  was a relative path to a relative symbolic link. 
  (For example: skycat ../x.fits, where x.fits is a link to y.fits).

--------------- 20.09.00 released skycat-2.6.3 -----------------

* Fixed a bug in the display of galactic and ecliptic coordinates: RA
  was being displayed in hours and the equinox was displayed as
  2000. Now RA is displayed in degrees in those cases and the equinox
  field displays "GALACTIC" or "ECLIPTIC".

* Upgraded the WCS library to wcssubs-2.8.3. 

--------------- 25.05.00 released skycat-2.6.2 -----------------

* Added the procedure "display_catalog {catalogName}" to the SkyCat
  itcl class, for use via the remote interface. Now you can send 
  this command to open a catalog window to display a catalog 
  (name from the skycat config file) or a local catalog file (path name).

* Note: the Solaris and HP single binary versions are now built with
  the same gcc compiler used to build the VLT software (There were
  previously some subtle incompatibilities).

* Removed an error message that caused problems  when the image header 
  and data were in separate files.

* Minor layout changes.

--------------- 21.03.00 released skycat-2.6.1 -----------------

* Tested compiling with Sun-CC 4.2 and fixed a number of incompatibilities.

--------------- 02.03.00 released skycat-2.6 -----------------

* Added support for displaying WFI type images, which contain
  multiple image extensions, as a single image, based on the
  CRPIX values in the extensions. The default bahavoir is as
  before, except that there is a new button in the HDU window
  "Display as one Image".

* Added a new button in the HDU window: "Use Settings from Main Image"
  that sets the colormap, color scaling options and cut levels for the
  preview images from the main image. This is needed, since the preview
  images often appear black when they have not been not prescaled.

* Merged the Skycat and RTD versions of the HDU window. Now the
  Skycat version is a subclass of the RTD version.

* Tested Skycat build with Tcl8.2/Tk8.2 and Scriptics TclPro-1.3
  and made minor changes in the Skycat configure script to
  support this. See ./INSTALL for details.
  
* Added a new Skycat/RTD option: -panel_orient horizontal|vertical
  and added code to support having the main info panel on the
  left with a vertical orientation. The default for RTD is horizontal,
  as before.

* Changed the default layout of the Skycat main panel to be on the
  left instead of the top (use "skycat -panel_orient horizontal" to
  get the old behavior). 

* Added code to check for valid command line options (The previous
  version sometimes crashed when passed invalid options).

--------------- 27.12.99 released skycat-2.5.3 -----------------

* Minor bug fixes for the pick object window (to handle
  transformations correctly).

---------------  15.12.99 released skycat-2.5.2 -----------------

* Merged in RTD changes made by Peter Biereichel (see rtd/CHANGES)

* Fixed minor bug in pick object window (rectangle was not being displayed
  in the center of the image).


---------------  02.11.99 released skycat-2.5.1 -----------------

* Fixed a bug dealing with leading zeros in formatting the seconds of RA
  (Could lead to incorrect plots and/or displayed values for RA).

---------------  25.10.99 released skycat-2.5 --------------------

* Merged in changes made by Peter Biereichel

---------------  09.9.99 released skycat-2.4.7 -------------------

* Fixed a bug in the formatting/printing of RA values (sometimes the
  fractional part of the seconds was incorrect).

* Updated for egcs/gcc-2.95 (This compiler version is stricter
  for C++ code and even fails the solaris X11 header files, unless
  told to ignore the errors...).

---------------  22.7.99 released skycat-2.4.6 -------------------

* TCS catalogs: fixed a bug dealing with TCS catalogs (error message
  was "empty TCS result"). 

* Fixed problem with catalog directory hierarchies. Previously, catalog
  names had to be unique in the entire catalog hierarchy. Now, the interface
  has been changed slightly to fix this (see cat/CHANGES). 

---------------  14.7.99 released skycat-2.4.5 -------------------

* Fixed a bug in the FITS I/O that caused problems under HP-UX when
  loading FITS tables.

* TCS catalogs: fixed a bug dealing with TCS catalogs (error message
  was "empty TCS result"). 

---------------  21.6.99 released skycat-2.4.4 -------------------

* catalogs: allow empty RA and DEC columns in query results
  where ra_col and dec_col are defined (previously an error mesage
  was generated: "error in RA value, expected HH:MM:SS").

* Fixed problem with double-click in FileSelect widget.

---------------  16.15.99 released skycat-2.4.3 -------------------

* HDU Display: Reversed the row order for displaying image extensions
  when sorting by CRPIX values (The order was previously incorrect).

* Fits I/O: For image files with multiple image extensions: Now each
  header is merged with the primary HDU header when checking for
  WCS keywords. Keywords in the extension header override the same
  keywords in the primary header.

* Fixed a number of RTD related bugs (see rtd/CHANGES).


---------------  02.04.99 released skycat-2.4.2 -------------------

* Added changes from Peter Biereichel:
  new rtdimage subcommand 'biasimage' and widget 'RtdImageBias'
  for on-the-fly bias image subtraction. The widget can be called from
  the real-time menu (See rtd/CHANGES).

* Fixed from HP-UX related bugs dealing with dynamic loading
  (see tclutil/CHANGES).

---------------  25.03.99 released skycat-2.4.1 -------------------

* Added a check when saving catalog data to a compressed image,
  since this is not implemented.

* Fixed the Exit menu item to really exit and not just close
  the window, in the case where there is more than one main
  window.

* Fixed bug in startup when creating history catalog.

* In the skycatgaia binary release, there was a problem with the
  ardmask binary (The release contained an older version).

* Fixed problems with BLT graphs and zooming.

---------------  22.03.99 released skycat-2.4 ---------------------

* Tested with SuSE-Linux-6.0 (gnulibc), TclPro-1.2, tcl8.0.5, the
  egcs-1.1.1 compiler and fixed a number of bugs that turned up there.

* The single binary skycat release is now created using Scriptics
  TclPro-1.2 (tcl8.0.5). You can still create Tcl7.6 versions using
  the older "ET" utility. The ET version does not work with tcl8.x.

* Changed the GAIA binary release to use Scriptics TclPro to generate
  a binary including all of the necessary scripts and extensions.  Now
  "skycatgaia" is just a large binary. The release also includes a
  large number of STARLINK and PPM binaries that are used to convert
  between various image formats.  
  (Note: skycatgaia is released as a separate package: see the skycat
  ftp site: ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/README.html).

* Added scrollbars to the catalog entry widget.

* RTD remote interface: Fixed socket error check in
  rtdrmt/src/rtdRemote.c.

* Rtd: Coordinates/Zoom window: Fixed an "off by one" bug that caused
  the wrong coordinates to be displayed for pixels when the image was
  rotated and/or flipped at zoom 1.

* Merged in changes from Peter W. Draper (Starlink) to support 16 and
  24 bit color. Skycat now supports 16 and 24 bit color displays!
  Thanks to Peter Draper (P.W.Draper@durham.ac.uk) for providing the
  necessary changes!

* Fixed a bug in the handling of local catalogs and "mmap" that could
  cause a core dump in certain cases.

* Added a work around to Tk's limit on canvas coordinates to short
  range. Now the canvas (and image) coordinates do not have to be
  clipped to short range. This limit previously caused problems when
  zooming in large images.

---------------  4.02.99 released skycat-2.3.2 ----------------------

* Ported the GAIA plugin to tcl8.0.3 and changed the release structure
  to make it easier to install and start. Now you can just unpack the
  tar file in a directory and start the script "skycatgaia".

* Removed redundant calls to Rtd_Init and Cat_Init in the skycat 
  tkAppInit.C file.

---------------  14.01.99 released skycat-2.3.1 ---------------------

* Upgraded the cfitsio sources to version cfitsio2027 (includes ESO
  HIERARCH keyword support).

---------------  29.12.98 released skycat-2.3 -----------------------

* The Skycat Tcl package and shared library now "contains" the Rtd and
  Cat packages. Previously it was dependent on them. This means that
  you should no longer load and/or link the Rtd and Cat libraries.
  Only the Skycat library is now required. This change was necessary,
  to avoid problems with static variables in shared libraries, since
  both the Cat and Rtd libraries contain some of the same object files
  (For backward compatibility reasons, both the Rtd and Cat libraries
  contain the contents of the Astrotcl and Tclutil packages).

---------------  28.12.98 released skycat-2.2.2 -----------------------

* Removed dialog asking if you want to save a temporary image, for
  example from an image server, since it sometimes caused
  problems. Now, if you save the temporary image, it will be added to
  the history catalog and menu. otherwise not.

* Fixed a bug in opening the image server window (error complains
  about the "Add to..." menu item not being found).

* Tested with Sunpro CC-2.4 and Solaris-2.6 and fixed minor
  compilation and linking problems.

* HDU window: Allow different NAXIS[12] values and try to determine
  correct row,col indexes anyway. If images overlap, the display order
  will be the oder of the HDUs as they are found in the file.

* HDU window: Show the selected HDU. The line in the table is now
  highlighted and the selected image HDU is displayed with a sunken
  relief.

---------------  03.12.98 released skycat-2.2.1 -----------------------

* Added a new item to the catalog window File menu: "Save with image",
  for saving catalogs as FITS binary tables and reloading them again.
  Now you can save local catalogs with the image, including plot
  symbol information.  Catalog configuration information is stored in
  the CATINFO table, which contains one row for each FITS table
  created from a catalog.

* Added a menu item to the Graphics menu: "Save graphics with image".
  Selecting this item adds a FITS table to the current image
  containing descriptions of all of the line graphics objects in the
  image. When you load the image again later, the graphics are
  restored automatically. The name of the FITS table is based on the
  name (EXTNAME) of the current FITS image extension, so you can save
  different graphics with each image extension.

* Changed the "-remote" option to use the RTD remote socket interface,
  if "Tk send" does not work. "Tk send" only works when you use X-Auth
  style X security.

---------------  16.11.98 released skycat-2.2 -----------------------

* Added support for multiple FITS HDUs. Now, when you open a FITS file
  with multiple HDUs, a window is displayed where you can choose
  which parts to display. FITS tables are displayed as local
  catalogs. Small versions of the images are displayed in a table, in
  the correct orientation, if posible, using the values of the CRPIX*
  keywords.  Clicking on an image displays it in the main window.

* Modified the CFITSIO sources files to handle ESO HIERARCH keywords.

* Ported Skycat to tcl8.0.3/BLT2.4f/Scriptics TclPro 
  (But still compatible with tcl7.6/tk4.2/BLT2.1)

  - Updated namespace syntax

  - Updated BLT references where needed (for BLT-2.1 or 2.4f)

  - Added a "tclpro" directory that replaces the "et" directory when
    building a single binary version for Tcl8. The Et code doesn't work
    with Tcl8, so the Tclpro product from Scripts is used instead, if it
    is available (and in your shell $PATH). 

* SkySearch.tcl: Fixed a problem linking catalog objects to line
  numbers when sorting was turned on.

* SkyCat.tcl: force full path names by -catalog option for local
  catalogs, to avoid confusion over local catalog names.

* Catalog window: Fixed a problem linking catalog objects to line
  numbers when sorting was turned on.

---------------  30.9.98 released skycat-2.1.3 -----------------------

* Upgraded wcslib to (Doug Mink's) wcssubs-2.5b, which fixes some problems 
  with COE projections and includes other bug fixes.

* Changed the release structure of the rtd, cat and astrotcl packages
  to include the necessary utility packages. Now the rtd and cat
  tarfiles also contain the astrotcl and tclutil packages. The top
  level Makefile and configure script automatically determine which
  packages to make. This does not affect the skycat release itself,
  since it always included the other packages.
   
* Rtd: Fixed a bug in the "Save region..." implementation, where FITS
  keywords were not updated correctly in some cases.

* Skycat, Catlib: fixed a bug in the handling of temporary image files
  (from image servers or when decompressing).

* Added an image history feature, for quick access to previously
  loaded images. This includes a "Go" menu, for quick access, and
  a "History" catalog menu item under Data-Servers. Images from
  image servers need to be saved to a file in order to be put in the
  history (see below). The history catalog is also used to save
  information about each file, such as the colormap and cut level
  settings.

* Added a dialog to ask the user if an image from an image server
  should be saved to a file before loading another image, so that file
  can be put in the image history list.

* Skycat now automatically saves and restores the main window size and
  position between sessions.

---------------  23.8.98 released skycat-2.1.2 -----------------------

* Catlib: image servers: Fixed a bug introduced in the previous
  version that caused problems when displaying images from an image
  server.

* Also made a number of minor bug fixes.

---------------  7.8.98 released skycat-2.1.1 ------------------------

* Skycat command line options: Changed -remote option to reuse the
  same image window and interpret only image and catalog
  arguments. This makes it easier to use skycat as a netscape
  application, for example: "skycat -remote 1 %s".  For catalogs, you
  can also do: "skycat -remote 1 -catalog %s".

* Catalogs: The "Select Area" button no longer pops up a message
  window telling you to drag out a region. It simply sets the mouse
  cursor (for convenience).

* Fixed a bug dealing with catalog name servers (SIMBAD, NED)
  introduced in the previous version.

* Removed default for limit on number of rows returned from a catalog
  query (%n in URL).

* Merged the image server interfaces with the catalog interfaces.  The
  AstroImage and TclAstroImage classes, and the astroimage Tcl command
  are still available for backward compatibility, but are now obsolete
  and should no longer be used. The AstroCatalog and TclAstroCat
  classes, and the astrocat Tcl command now handle image servers as
  well as catalogs. The "getimage" methods/subcommands are now part of
  the catalog classes. The merge was made to avoid duplicating large
  chunks of code, since there are many similarities in the two
  interfaces. 

* Now it is possible to generate image server windows with custom
  search labels and without the default search widgets (name, ra, dec,
  radius).  This was previously only supported for catalogs. In both
  cases, if you don't want the default search widgets, add these lines
  to the config entry:
     ra_col: -1
     dec_col: -1
     x_col: -1
     y_col: -1
  For catalogs, this means that there are no searchable ra,dec or x,y
  columns. For image servers, it means that you can't search by these
  values, so they are not displayed.

* Catalog config file: Allow search columns with only one value
  (previously only min and max values were allowed). This feature is
  enabled if the second label is missing in the "search_cols: "
  keyword in the catalog config file. For example, in an image server: 
     search_cols:    patch Patch
  will display a "Patch:" label and entry in the user interface. In
  the URL for the image server, "%cond" will then be replaced by
  "patch=22", if the user typed in 22.

* Fixed the handling of the "maxRows" field for searching catalogs,
  so that, if it is left blank or zero, there is no limit (previous
  versions had a default limit).

* Updated to wcssubs-2.4 (Doug Mink's wcslib, on which the SAOWCS
  C++ class is based). This fixes some bugs in the handling of
  world coordinates rotation. 

---------------  5.8.98 released skycat-2.1 --------------------------

* Added a top level configure script that runs configure in the
  subdirectories.  This way you can just run "configure..." in place
  of "make World...". A "Makefile.in" was also added. A top level
  Makefile is still included in the release for backward
  compatibility.

* Changed the name of the top level directory in the source release
  tar files to include the version number (for example: skycat-2.0.19/). 
  This is more standard and avoids problems updating old directories.

* Image previews, image servers: Added code to check the the HTTP
  Content-Encoding of image files (instead of only the Content-type),
  to help recognize compression types.

* Added HTTP password authorization suport. If an HTTP server returns
  the error "Authorization Required", skycat now opens a dialog box
  and asks for the username and password. The information is cached
  for later use.

* Added support for backup URLs for image servers (was previously only
  supported for catalogs). This is activated by using the "backup1"
  and "backup2" keywords in the catalog config file.

* "Reload Config File" now works recursively and reloads the
  information in any remote catalog directories that were
  open. Previously, only the top level catalogs were reloaded.

* Added the X11 library directory to shared lib path in startup script.

* catlib: Fixed a bug where the "id" column was still assumed to be
  always 0 (The id column index is now always taken from catalog
  config file).

* catlib: Changed the way that rows are inserted into local
  catalogs. They were previously appended to the end of the file after
  removing duplicates.  Now the original row position is kept and the
  row is updated if it already exists (same id) and appended
  otherwise.  
  
* Color scaling: Added new command line option "-color_scale" to set
  the color scaling on startup. The option takes a value: one of
  linear, log, sqrt, histeq.  Also made changes so that the color
  scaling setting is remembered between images and reapplied.  

* Coordinates: Added new coordinate type: "chip", for detector chip or
  CCD coordinates, that takes into account the origin of the chip and
  binning. X,Y coordinates in the user interface are now displayed in
  chip coordinates, which are the same as image coordinates, unless
  the FITS keywords "HIERARCH ESO DET WIN STRX" and "...STRY" are
  defined or special fields in the real-time image event struct are
  set. Also added two new fields to the RTD real-time image event
  struct in rtdImageEvent.h: startX and startY, with the same meaning
  as the FITS keywords above.

* RTD now reads cut level values from the real-time image events and
  sets the image cut levels, unless the user set them already by hand.
  User values override real-time event cut level values.

* Implemented "histogram equalization" color scaling and added it to
  the list of choices in the Rtd "Colors" popup window (based on
  saoimage source code).

* Added code to handle NAN values for image pixels. They are now
  treated as blank pixels.

* Updated to wcssubs-2.3.2 (Doug Mink's wcslib, on which the SAOWCS
  C++ class is based). This fixes a number of bugs in the handling of
  world coordinates. 

* Error and info dialogs: Added code to truncate messages with too
  many lines to be displayed and also made the dialog windows wider.

* Top level windows: Fixed minor bug that prevented the code from
  remembering the locations of top level widgets. Now, if you place a
  window somewhere, it comes up there the next time the window is
  created in that session.

* The catalog and image server windows were using up too many file
  descriptors. Now the files are only opened as needed and then closed
  again immediately.

---------------  07.7.98 released skycat-2.0.18 --------------------------

* catlib: allow local catalog search without ra,dec columns, fixed
  handling of default column positions for ra and dec, to allow
  catalogs with no ra,dec or x,y columns.

* Image I/O: Changed location of the temp file used when compressing
  or decompressing an image from "file.tmp" to /tmp/fitsioXXXXXX,
  since the directory that file is in may not be writable or might be
  on a CD.

* class HTTP: added suport for HTTP POST: new methods: HTTP::post(url,
  data) and HTTP::post(url, data, ostream).

* Other minor changes (see */CHANGES files).

---------------  26.6.98 released skycat-2.0.17 --------------------------

* Skycat, single binary version: Added check for correct prolog.ps
  file in ~/.skycat dir (many users have an outdated version of this
  file in the ~/.skycat dir, created by an earlier skycat release).

* Rtd: Changed footers in postscript output to include object name,
  file name and center position.

* Tested compiling with egcs-1.0.3 (based on gcc-2.8.x) and fixed minor
  errors and warnings that were reported by the new compiler.

* Added support for HTTP proxy servers (thanks to Peter Draper for
  implementing this).

* Catalog window: added a menu (under Options) and dialog window for
  setting a proxy server for HTTP catalog access from behind a
  firewall.

---------------  19.6.98 released skycat-2.0.16 --------------------------

* Catalog window: Minor change in the way query coordinates are
  interpreted.  If the RA value is an integer, it is assumed to be in
  hours (as before), but if it is a decimal number (3.2, for example),
  it is assumed to be in degrees.

* Catalog window: fixed bug in the handling of the MORE URL (mostly
  used for HST catalogs). The "M=" part before the URL was not being
  recognized.

* Rtd: Printing Images now outputs better postscript, since it no
  longer does a screen dump, but generates postscript directly from
  the image and graphics information (see also rtd/CHANGES).

* Rtd: changed focus policy to fix problems with mouse pointer warping
  (moving mouse with arrow keys). The previous version included some
  code to avoid obscure problems with the CDE window manager, with the
  "click to focus" setting.  If anyone has problems with the new
  version, please let me know.

---------------  28.5.98 released skycat-2.0.15 --------------------------

* Added support for HTTP redirect "Location: ..." to HTTP class

* Catalogs: MORE and PREVIEW fields can now be commands. No special
  check is made for "http://" or "file://" as before.  For PREVIEW
  data, the stdout of the command is assumed to be a FITS file, if it
  starts with "SIMPLE", and otherwise catalog data to plot.

* FitsIO::blankImage(...), Changed generated blank images to use the
  normal colormap colors instead of all blank pixels, so that you can
  change the background color of a generated image by manipulating the
  colormap.

* Catalog window: "Data-Servers/Local catalogs" menu: Added check for
  local catalogs, to see if the file exists. If not, you are asked if
  you want to specify a new name or remove the catalog from the menu.

* Image Server window: added "Select Area..." button to to select the
* area of the image to fetch (as with the catalog window).

---------------  13.5.98 released skycat-2.0.14 --------------------------

* Catalogs: Added a "help" field to the catalog config file, which may
  optionally contain a URL pointing to information about the
  catalog. If the "help" URL is specified, a "Help" button appears in
  the user interface, which displays the URL in netscape (using the
  remote interface, if netscape is already running).

* Catalogs: Fixed problem with "Preview" images that was caused by
  using the same temporary file to hold the image each time (now uses
  a new file each time and deletes the old one).

* SkyCat.tcl: remote interface proc: pick_object: fixed a minor bug
  that reported an unknown Tcl variable.

---------------  4.5.98 released skycat-2.0.13 -----------------------------

* Fixed a recently introduced bug in coordinate conversion
  that caused problems plotting catalog symbols for images with 
  equinox != 2000.

* Catalog window: Fixed "Reload Config File" menu item to remove
  "dead" catalog entries (entries that were removed from the config
  file since the last time it was read).

* Other minor changes.

---------------  28.4.98 released skycat-2.0.12 -----------------------------

* Pick Object window: Merged in Peter Biereichel's changes, which
  include using a "zoom window" for the image.  This lets you zoom in
  and out to get the correct resolution. Also changed the default
  layout of the window to save space. You can get the old layout by
  specifying the command line option "-pickobjectorient horizontal".

* The single binary version of skycat is now linked with the shared X
  libraries. This is necessary in order to be able to dynamically load
  shared libraries for skycat plugins at runtime. If this causes any
  problems, check out ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/, where
  we will provide tar files with the necessary libraries. 

* Various minor bug fixes.

---------------  15.4.98 released skycat-2.0.11 ------------------------------

* Allow additional suffixes for automatic compression and
  decompression of FITS files: ".gz" for gzip, ".Z" for UNIX
  compression (i.e.: file.fits.Z, file.fits.gz).

* Added "public", "private", and "protected" keywords in the Itcl 
  source as well as some comments to help identify the public
  interface, for use by skycat plugins and extensions. 

* Updated the man pages for all of the Itcl classes to include the
  Itk components and standard options used.

* Minor changes in configure script and top level makefile for shared
  libraries

* Fixed a bug in image pixel coordinate conversion that caused the
  world coordinates to be slightly shifted in images created with the
  "File => Save region as..." menu item.

* Various minor bug fixes.

--------------- 31.03.98 released skycat 2.0.10 -----------------------

* Updated man pages and documentation

* Fixed the -shm_data and -shm_header options, which were no longer
  working after earlier changes.

--------------- 25.03.98 released skycat 2.0.9 -----------------------

* This release contains a number of minor changes to make it easier
  for plugins and subclasses to override the default behavior.
  See the */CHANGES files for details.

* Added "clone" number to window headers, to help identify related windows
  when there is more than one main window.

* Change keyboard accelerators for menu items to use <Control> instead
  of <Alt>, since <Alt> is used in Tk for popping up a menu with the
  keyboard (see -underline option in menubutton(n)).

* Added -float_panel option to allow info panel to be in a popup
  window (default is off, no change), usage: rtd ... -float_panel 1,
  to enable.

* Added -panel_layout option to allow changing the order of the zoom
  and pan windows in the layout (default is the same as before, no
  change). Usage: rtd ... -panel_layout $value, where value is one of
  {saoimage reverse default}, for an saoimage type layout, reverse or
  default.

* Compress: Upgraded to new "press" library routines to fix bug found in
  H-compress code (Bug was only in decompression).

--------------- 05.03.98 released skycat 2.0.8 -----------------------

* Added a -remote option to skycat: usage: "skycat -remote 1 file ..."
  When "-remote 1" is specified and a skycat application is already
  running on the same display, the existing skycat application opens a
  new main window to display the image. In this way, you only need to
  have one skycat application running at a time, which saves memory
  and colors in the colormap. Note that this feature uses "Tcl send",
  which has a special X security check and so won't work if you use
  the "XHOST" style X security. Unless X security is disabled in the
  binary, you need to use XAUTH style security. See the "Tcl/Tk Tools"
  book for a good explanation of this.

* For backward compatibility: Removed dependence on the Tix package
  (now part of tclutil package).
 
* For backward compatibility: Removed application dependence on the
  tclutil and astrotcl packages by merging these into the rtd and cat
  libraries in the installation (i.e.: the object files from astrotcl
  and tclutil are included in the master rtd and cat libraries and the
  include files are copied to the rtd and cat include dirs. 

* Implemented rotation for canvas graphics. Since Tk doesn't support
  this directly, it is done now in Tcl code. Polygons are now used
  in place of rectangles, to make it posible to rotate a rectangle.
  (The appearance and funtionality is the same). You still can't
  rotate ovals, but you can rotate a smooth rectangle, which is
  similar (see below).

* Added a "Smooth" option in the graphics window (CanvasDraw), so you 
  can make smooth (rounded) rectangles, polygons or polylines. 

* Made it possible to "select" a catalog symbol in the image, even if
  it is hidden by another symbol on top of it. If one symbol is hidden
  behind another, just click again to select it. You can "cycle"
  through a stack of symbols by clicking multiple times. Use
  <Control>-1 to toggle the selection of a symbol.

* Added a "Filter" button to the catalog display widget to filter out
  objects that are not visible in the query result list.  This is
  needed because the query is circular, while the image is
  rectangular, leaving some objects in the listing that can not be
  plotted in the image.

* Added a new command line option: "-catalog $catalogName". Now you
  can have a catalog window (local or other) opened automatically
  when skycat starts. i.e.: "skycat file.fits -catalog file.cat".

* Plugins: The SKYCAT_PLUGIN environment variable may now contain
  a colon separated list of plugin files or directories. For 
  directories, teh default file name for a skycat plugin is
  SkyCat_plugin.tcl, which defines the Tcl proc SkyCat_plugin.

--------------- 13.2.98 released skycat 2.0.7 -----------------------

* Moved the catalog symbol plotting code from Tcl to C++ to improve the
  performace of plotting 1000's of objects on large images. (In one test,
  the time required to plot a large catalog was reduced from about 60
  secs to about 3 seconds).

* Removed the "unexec" directories (replaced by "et" - Embedded Tk).
  The "unexec" code was previously used to create a single binary and
  has been replaced by "et" now.

---------------  9.2.98 released skycat 2.0.6 --------------------------------

* Fixed problems with floating point precision when converting world
  coordinates (raised from default of 6 digits to max 17 digits.)

* Fixed bug in introduced in the last version that could cause a core
  dump when setting the cut levels.

---------------  3.2.98 released skycat 2.0.5 --------------------------------

* Added a selection mechanism to select a region of the image or
  canvas.  The graphics toolbox now contains a "region" item that can
  be used to select a region of the image. Also added binding
  <Control-Button-1> as a shortcut to select a region.

* Improved selection of catalog plot symbols in the image and listbox.
  Plot symbols are now selected in the image with mouse button 1.  If
  the shift or control key are also down, multiple objects may be
  selected. Objects may be selected in either the image window or the
  table listing, with the same effect. The selected objects may be
  added to a local catalog, etc...

* Added a menu item to the "Real-Time ==> Rapid Frame menu": 
  "Delete Rapid Frame", to delete the current rapid frame.

* Added a new rtdimage subcommand: "mmap", which has a similar syntax to
  the "shm" subcommand. The rtd "shm" subcommand is used to manipulate
  sysV shared memory areas containing the image and header data. The
  rtd "mmap" subcommand does the same, but with "mmap" memory, which is
  the default, since rtd uses mmap to read image files.

* Rtd now checks the value of the FITS "BLANK" or "BADPIXEL" keywords
  and ignores these pixels when setting cutlevels or doing any 
  calculations. The blank pixels are displayed black by default.

---------------  26.1.98 released skycat 2.0.4 -------------------------------

* Added support for Tcl plugins for all top level widget classes and
  added documentation and examples in the Skycat documentation
  (see ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/doc/skycat.ps.gz)

* Updated comments in Itcl sources for automatic generation of man pages.
  (There are now man pages for all Itcl classes).

* Added postscript (framemaker) documentation for all packages
  (tclutil, astritcl, rtd, cat, skycat), 
  see: ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/doc

* Add menu accelerators (keyboard shortcuts) in Skycat, Rtd and Cat menus

* Split the "top level" AstroCat class into different "frame" classes,
  by request. Now the AstroCat class is made up of an AstroQuery class
  (defines the panel with the search entries) and the QueryResult
  class (defines the table for displaying the query results). None of
  these classes knows about images. For image support, see the Skycat
  package, which contains classes that are derived from these and add
  image support.

---------------  released skycat 2.0.2 -------------------------------

* Compilied sources with the SunPRO C++ compiler and fixed problems 
  that showed up there and not with gcc.

* Replaced "unexec" package with "ET" (Embedded Tk), for creating a
  single binary of skycat, including Tcl sources and colormaps, etc.
  (The unexec version is still included, but not used by default).

* Reorganized sources to include 2 new packages: 

  The "Tclutil" package was created by gathering "generic" Tcl and C++
  code from various applications into a single generic Tcl package.

  The "Astrotcl" package was created by gathering general astronomy
  related Tcl and C++ code from other packages into a single, reusable
  package.

  Note: if you were using the Rtd or Cat packages in another application,
  there are some minor changes to be made to the initialization code to
  initialize the new packages.

* Moved catalog widgets to the Cat package.

* changes in skycat user interface: 

  - There is a new catalog menu layout.

  - added support for a hierarchy of catalog directories. There
    is a new type of catalog called "directory" that has a URL 
    that points to other catalog config files, possibly on other
    hosts.
	
  - Added a new popup window for displaying and browsing the catalog
    directory tree. You can select catalogs from various catalog servers
    and save them in your own personal config file. The changes appear
    immediately in the catalog menu.

  - Added a menu item to reload the catalog config file after you have
    edited it by hand.

  - The layout of the catalog window is now dependent on the 
    information in the catalog config file (search columns).

  - Added support for editing the catalog config file. There are now
    menu items for setting the sort columns and sort order, search
    columns, column display order, columns to show or hide, plot symbol
    info (see the "Options" menu - changes are automatically saved in
    ~/.skycat/skycat.cfg)

  - Added more support for plot symbols: Now you can configure the
    color, shape, angle, size and units of the symbols to be displayed
    in the image for a star or other object. There is a window interface
    for editing the settings (see the Options menu).

--------------- 17 Jun 97 released skycat 1.1 ------------------------

* Rtd, Skycat, Catlib: added support for shared libraries, itcl2.2,
  tk4.2, tcl7.6. blt-2.1, loadable modules, packages. 
  Use: "configure --enable-shared ..." (see INSTALL file).

* The Rtd configure script now gets information from the Tcl/Tk config
  files (tclConfig.sh, tkConfig.sh, etc...) and generates its own
  rtdConfig.sh file, which is used by the catlib and skycat configure
  scripts. This makes running configure faster and hopefully more
  portable.

* added a make target "release_bin" that generates a binary/interpreted
  release of skycat. This can be used in place of the single binary
  "unexec" version on systems where that doesn't work.

* various bug fixes in rtd and catlib (see rtd/CHANGES and cat/CHANGES)

--------------- 13 Feb 97 released skycat 1.0.6 ---------------------

* various bug fixes (see rtd/CHANGES, cat/CHANGES)

--------------- 30 Jan 97 released skycat 1.0.5 ---------------------

* (Catlib) added support for backup catalog servers and local catalog 
  config files.

* Skycat catalog windows:
  The default catalog/archive/image server is now taken as the first
  one in the config file and no longer hard coded to names such as
  "Guide Star Catalog at ESO".

* Added World Coordinates support to the real-time image events by
  extending the structure used to pass images to the RTD via the 
  rtdServer. 
  *** (NOTE: incompatible change: clients must at least be recompiled!)

--------------- 21 Nov 96 released skycat 1.0.3 ---------------------

* Fixed byte-swap problems in FITS files and made Linux compatible. 
  Skycat should now work on machines that have a byte order that is
  different from network byte-order (such as PCs).
  Thanks to Sidik Isani <isani@cfht.hawaii.edu> for supplying the patches
  for this.

* The "Pick Object" feature (View Menu) now also works for images that
  do not support world coordinates.

* (Rtd) Local file URLs are now supported, i.e., file:/path/name...
  Now you can specify the URL for the catalog config file using file:/...

* (Catlib) It is now possible to search GSC by Id.
  
--------------- 14 Nov 96 released skycat 1.0.2 ---------------------

* Changed configure scripts and makefiles so that skycat can be used
  as a separate package, assuming the correct Rtd and Catlib versions
  have already been installed.

--------------- 8 Nov 96 released skycat 1.0.1 ----------------------

* (Rtd) Fixed compass to display East correctly (was reversed...)

* (Skycat, Catlib) Added copyright field to catalog config file and
  added item to the user interface to display the copyright info for
  the current catalog or image server.

--------------- 7 Nov 96 released skycat 1.0 ----------------------

* (WCS lib) Major improvements in the World Coordinates handling.  The
  WCS information for HST images should be handled correctly now, so
  you can plot guide stars, etc. This previously worked correctly only
  for some images (such as those from DSS). Many thanks to Doug Mink
  (dmink@cfa.harvard.edu) for supplying the WCS library and bug fixes.

* (Rtd) added a new "Grid" feature (see View menu) that displays a
  world coordinates based grid over the image. You can also control
  the grid size (distance in arcsecs between grid lines) in a new
  entry in the main panel.

* (Rtd) The compass widget (N-E display in panel) was removed and
  replaced with a more correct display in the Pan window. The Pan
  window now displays 2 arrows indicating the real north and east for
  the image, based on the world coordinate information.

* (Rtd) fixed bug in "measure band" display that caused incorrect
  distances to be displayed for the width and height lines (the
  diagonal was ok).

* (Rtd) Added bindings to measure band so that arrow keys can be used to
  position it.

--------------- 23 Oct 96 released skycat 1.0b16 ----------------------

* (skycat) fixed the single binary problem related to the tclEnv patch
  (see below), since the original fix did not work. The tclEnv patch is 
  still the same.

--------------- 22 Oct 96 released skycat 1.0b15 ----------------------

* (skycat) fixed a problem that only showed up in the single binary 
  version of skycat: under certain circumstances, skycat would
  crash immediately on start up. I had to patch a a Tcl source file
  (tclEnv.c) to fix this (see skycat/CHANGES and patches/tclEnv.patch).

* (Rtd) fixed bug setting cut levels (was a result of changing the
  way the min/max pixel value is set).

* (catlib) Fixed bug when saving local catalogs for images that are
  not J2000.  (The catalog was saved as B1950, for example and later
  treated as J2000 when loaded). Now all local catalogs are saved (the
  ra,dec columns) in equinox J2000 and are expected to be in J2000 when
  opened.

* (Rtd) changed the bindings on the "measure band" so that it acts more like
  a menu or the line graphics: it will stay up if you click <3>, release
  and then drag. Clicking <3> again makes it go away.  <Shift-Button3>
  now makes it "freeze" so you can keep it where it is.  <Ctrl-Button3>
  (or <Ctrl-Motion>) displays just the single line mband.

* (Rtd) Changed the way image cut levels are set by default. In the
  previous version, cut levels were not changed at all when a new
  image was loaded, which meant that you usually had to press the
  "Auto Set Cut Levels" button to make the image visible. Now this has
  been changed as follows: If you set the cut levels explicitly by
  typing in a number or moving a slider bar, etc., they will not be
  changed, even if a new image is loaded.  However, if you have the
  cut levels calculated automatically by pressing the "Auto Set Cut
  Levels" button or the "Median Filter" button, etc., then it is
  assumed that new cut levels can be set automatically when a new
  image is loaded.  (We would be interested to hear any comments on
  this. Maybe we should make this behavior optional ny adding a
  checkbutton somewhere...)

* (Rtd) Made a number of changes designed to improve performance on very large
  images (got test image from Kim Gillies: 170 MB, 8192 x 5464 floats):
  
  * the zoom window is no longer updated from the pan window, since that can
    cause a lot of disk activity on large images (the mouse easily crosses the 
    entire pan image, which would have to be displayed in the zoom window).

  * auto set cut levels, median filter, finding min/max pixel, etc. now are 
    only calculated for the visible part of the image and (for speed) don't 
    examine all image pixels.

* (skycat) added confirmation dialogs for entering, updating and deleting local
  catalog entries.

* (catlib) The catalog config file entry is now written to local catalogs 
  (in the header) so that the same plot symbol is used when the file is reloaded.

--------------- 1 Oct 96 released skycat 1.0b12 ----------------------

* added new View menu item: "WCS Info" for setting/displaying basic
  world coordinate information.

--------------- 20 Sep 96 released skycat 1.0b11 ------------------

* loading of very large images should be faster now, since "mmap(2)" is
  used to map files to memory rather than reading them. Also, the alogorithm
  used to get the min and max pixel values has been changed to not look
  at every pixel (see rtd/CHANGES).

* now using new SAO wcs library (wcssubs-1.0).

* made improvements to the colormap handling code to avoid color flashing
  when using a private colormap (see rtd/CHANGES).

* split the "./cat" directory into "./cat" (catalog libraries only)
  and "./skycat" (skycat application, interpreted and single binary
  versions), by request.
