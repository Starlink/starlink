DESCRIPTION
Class ImageIO is used to read, write and manage the memory for
astronomical images of various formats. The image header and data may
be optionally kept in shared memory (mmap or shm), so they can be
accessed by external processes that may want to do image processing or
other operations. Regardless of the original image format and derived
class, the header and data are always kept in FITS format. Other image
types are converted to FITS format by the derived classes (see below).
Subclasses of ImageIORep can, however, specify via a virtual method
whether the image data is in network or in native byte order (see
below).

CLASS STRUCTURE
Class ImageIO uses reference counting to make it easier to share
objects of this type for displaying in multiple windows.  The actual
(abstract) base class is ImageIORep. An ImageIO object contains a
pointer to an ImageIORep object, which may be shared by multiple
ImageIO objects.  To add new image types, to the ImageIO class,
classes are derived from ImageIORep.

WORLD COORDINATES SUPPORT
This class offers optional support of world coordinates for the image,
which can be initialized by calling the wcsinit() method, which must
be defined in a derived class, such as FitsIO. Normally wcsinit() will
get the necessary information from the image header, which is normally
assumed to be in FITS format.

METHODS

ImageIO()
	Default constructor, creates a null object (use assignment
	operator to set later);

ImageIO(ImageIORep* rep)
	Constructor, from a pointer to a subclass of ImageIORep
	(FitsIO, for example).  "rep" should be allocated with the
	"new" operator and will be deleted by this class when there
	are no more references to it. Note that this constructors
	enables automatic conversion from a pointer to a subclass of
	ImageIORep to class ImageIO.

	Examples: 
	// create an ImageIO object from a FITS file
	ImageIO imio1 = FitsIO::read(filename);

	// create an ImageIO object from FITS data and header in memory
	Mem header(...), data(...);
	ImageIO imio2 = new FitsIO(w, h, type, bzero, bscale, header, data);


ImageIO(const ImageIO&)
	Copy constructor: only copies the internal pointer and raises
	the reference count.

~ImageIO()
	Destructor, lowers the reference count and frees the memory,
  	if there are no more references.

ImageIO& operator=(const ImageIO&)
	Assignment operator: reference counted.

usingNetBO()
	Return true if the ImageIORep subclass uses native byte
	ordering.  FITS files and most other image formats are in
	network byte order, however, the derived class may want to
	byte swap the data first, if needed, so that it is easier to
	work with. This virtual method is checked by classes that use
	this object to determine if byte-swapping may need to be done.

write(filename)
	Write the image header and data to a file in a format defined
	in the derived class.

get(keyword, val)
	Find and set the value for the given FITS keyword and return 0
	if OK (found). This method is overloaded for various data types.

get(keyword)
	Find and return the string value for the given FITS keyword,
	or NULL if not found.

scaleValue(d)
	Apply the FITS keyword values for BZERO and BSCALE to the
	given value (d = BZERO+d*BSCALE)
 
unScaleValue(d)
	Reverse the effect of BZERO and BSCALE (d = (d-BZERO)/BSCALE)

width()
	Return the width of the image in pixels. 

height() 
	Return the height of the image in pixels. 

bitpix() 
	Return the value of the BITPIX keyword (data type of image). 

bscale() 
	Return value for the BSCALE keyword.

bzero() 
	Return the value for the BZERO keyword. 

header() 
	Return a reference to the FITS header (class Mem). 

data() 
	Return a reference to the FITS image data (class Mem). 

header(const Mem& newheader)
	Replace teh image header.
   
data(const Mem& newdata)
	Replace the image data with new data of same size.

WCS& wcs()
	Return a reference to the object used to manage world
	coordinates. Note that this object is reference counted in the
	same way as the ImageIO class.

void wcs(const WCS& newwcs)
	Set the WCS object used to manage world coordinates. Since the
	WCS class is also a reference counted wrapper around an
	abstract base class (WCSRep), you can define subclasses of
	class WCSRep that redefines the behavior and implementation of
	the WCS object.
