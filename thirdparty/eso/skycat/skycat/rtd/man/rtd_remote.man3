NAME
rtdRemote - C interface for remote access to rtdimage based widgets

SYNOPSIS
#include "rtdRemote.h"

typedef void (*RtdRemoteErrorHandler)(char* message);

int rtdRemoteConnect(int pid, char* host, int port);
void rtdRemoteDisconnect();

int rtdRemoteSend(char* cmd, char** result);
int rtdRemoteGetResult(int socket, char** result);

RtdRemoteErrorHandler rtdRemoteSetErrorHandler(RtdRemoteErrorHandler);
char* rtdRemoteGetError();

DESCRIPTION
This man page describes a simple remote interface to rtdimage based
applications. With this interface, a client application can connect to
a running application displaying an rtdimage, send commands and get
results.

REMOTE COMMANDS
The commands are sent as ASCII strings via socket and have the same
syntax as the rtdimage Tcl commands, except that no instance name is
required. The command strings are not "evaluated" by Tcl, but are
interpreted by the rtdimage code. Any commands that are not handled
directly by the rtdimage C++ code may be passed on to a registered Tcl
handler proc or [incr Tk] method. In this way, the list of available
remote commands can be extended in the Tcl/Tk application.

INTERFACE
rtdRemoteConnect(pid, hostname, port)
	Connect to a remote rtdimage application. If pid, hostname and
	port are zero (null), they are read from the file
	$HOME/.rtd-remote, if it exists. This file is created by by an
	rtdimage widget when it starts to listen for a remote
	connection (see rtdimage, "remote" subcommand). Otherwise,
	if you know the pid, hostname and port, you can specify them
	here. This routine initializes an internal static structure
	with information about the connection.

rtdRemoteDisconnect()
	Disconnect from remote rtdimage.

rtdRemoteSend(cmd, result)
	The routine sends the given command to the remote rtdimage for
	evaluation and returns the status of the command. The result
	argument is set to point to the command results. The result
	pointer points to an internal buffer that is only valid until
	the next call to this routine.

	The command syntax is the same as for the "rtdimage" widget
	(image type), except that the instance name is missing.
	Example:
  
 	   char* result;
	    int status = rtdRemoteCmd("wcscenter", &result);
	    if (status == 0) {
 	        ...
 	    }

	If the command could not be sent, result is set to a NULL
	pointer and an error status (1) is returned. The error message
	can be retrieved with rtdRemoteGetError().

rtdRemoteSetErrorHandler(errorHandler)
	Set an error handler to be called when errors occur, format: 
	    void errorhandler(char* msg).

rtdRemoteGetError();
	Return the text of the last error message.

EXAMPLE

/*
 * The following example demonstrates the use of the remote rtd interface:
 */


/* 
 * this routine is used for convenience in testing below 
 * Send the command to the rtdimage, then print and return the result.
 */
static char* send_rtd(char* cmd) 
{
    char* result = NULL;
    int status = rtdRemoteSend(cmd, &result); 
    printf("%s ==> %s: %s\n", cmd, (status ? "FAILED" : "OK"), result);
    return result;
}

main()
{
    int data_id, header_id;

    /* 
     * connect to running rtd.
     * uses default args taken from ~/.rtd-remote file 
     */
    if (rtdRemoteConnect(0, NULL, 0) != 0) 
	exit(1);

    /* send some commands to RTD to be evaluated */
    send_rtd("wcscenter");
    send_rtd("bitpix");
    send_rtd("scale");
    send_rtd("width");
    send_rtd("height");
    send_rtd("config -file ngc1316r.fits");
    send_rtd("width");
    send_rtd("height");

    data_id = atoi(send_rtd("shm get data"));
    header_id = atoi(send_rtd("shm get header"));

    exit(0);
}
