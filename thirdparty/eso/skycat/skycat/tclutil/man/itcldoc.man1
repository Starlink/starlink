NAME
itcldoc - script to extract man pages from itcl class source files

SYNOPSIS
itcldoc ?filenames?

DESCRIPTION
Itcldoc is a tcl script used to extract man pages from itcl class
source files.  The itcldoc script assumes a certain style of coding,
but does not require any special hints otherwise. It assumes comments
precede each declaration in comment blocks. The script splits an itcl
file into a Tcl list. It first filters the comments to make them list
elements.  It then looks for declaration keywords in the list: class,
method, proc, itk_option, public, protected,... and sorts and
documents them based on the comments in the code preceding the
declarations.

In addition, each source file should have a comment header containing
a line in the format:

# filename.tcl - short description

It is assumed that each file given defines one itcl class.

This script is only used for itcl files defining an itcl class. By
convention itcl classes start with an upper case letter and the file
names for files that contain classes should have the same name with a
".tcl" extension.

See the source files and man pages in this package for examples.
