* Status

                    /*--------------------------.
                    | Sane for full scale use.  |
                    `--------------------------*/

* Interoperability bugs

** libtool 1.4.2, configure.ac, and AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR

configure.ac files that use AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR do not work with libtool
1.4.2.  To work around the problem, you can rename configure.ac to
configure.in.  Or you can apply Roger Leigh's patch to libtool; see
<http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/libtool-patches/2002-January/001659.html>.
