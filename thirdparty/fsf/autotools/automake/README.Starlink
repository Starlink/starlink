This is GNU automake 1.15 with patches to support Fortran, preprocessed
Fortran and special requirements for the Starlink project.

The "automake" directory contains the modified vendor source. It should be
updated as appropriate and files regenerated with an unmodified
autoconf/automake (as same version as from the original distribution) as there
are no Starlink configuration requirements, they should only be found in this
directory. The intention is to keep patches against vendor as simple as
possible.
