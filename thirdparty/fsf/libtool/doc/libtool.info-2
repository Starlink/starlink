Install mode
============

   In "install" mode, libtool interprets most of the elements of
MODE-ARGS as an installation command beginning with `cp', or a
BSD-compatible `install' program.

   The following components of MODE-ARGS are treated specially:

`-inst-prefix INST-PREFIX-DIR'
     When installing into a temporary staging area, rather than the
     final PREFIX, this argument is used to reflect the temporary path,
     in much the same way `automake' uses DESTDIR.  For instance, if
     PREFIX is `/usr/local', but INST-PREFIX-DIR is `/tmp', then the
     object will be installed under `/tmp/usr/local/'.  If the
     installed object is a libtool library, then the internal fields of
     that library will reflect only PREFIX, not INST-PREFIX-DIR:

          # Directory that this library needs to be installed in:
          libdir='/usr/local/lib'

     not

          # Directory that this library needs to be installed in:
          libdir='/tmp/usr/local/lib'

     `inst-prefix' is also used to insure that if the installed object
     must be relinked upon installation, that it is relinked against
     the libraries in INST-PREFIX-DIR/PREFIX, not PREFIX.

     In truth, this option is not really intended for use when calling
     libtool directly; it is automatically used when `libtool
     --mode=install' calls `libtool --mode=relink'.  Libtool does this
     by analyzing the destination path given in the original `libtool
     --mode=install' command and comparing it to the expected
     installation path established during `libtool --mode=link'.

     Thus, end-users need change nothing, and `automake'-style `make
     install DESTDIR=/tmp' will Just Work(tm).

   The rest of the MODE-ARGS are interpreted as arguments to the `cp'
or `install' command.

   The command is run, and any necessary unprivileged post-installation
commands are also completed.

Finish mode
===========

   "Finish" mode helps system administrators install libtool libraries
so that they can be located and linked into user programs.

   Each MODE-ARG is interpreted as the name of a library directory.
Running this command may require superuser privileges, so the
`--dry-run' option may be useful.

==============

   "Uninstall" mode deletes installed libraries, executables and
objects.

   The first MODE-ARG is the name of the program to use to delete files

(beginning with a `-'), or the names of files to delete.

libtool's temporary files associated with them.

   The first MODE-ARG is the name of the program to use to delete files
(typically `/bin/rm').

   The remaining MODE-ARGS are either flags for the deletion program
(beginning with a `-'), or the names of files to delete.

Writing `Makefile' rules for libtool
====================================

   Libtool is fully integrated with Automake (*note Introduction:
(automake)Top.), starting with Automake version 1.2.

   If you want to use libtool in a regular `Makefile' (or
`Makefile.in'), you are on your own.  If you're not using Automake 1.2,
and you don't know how to incorporate libtool into your package you
need to do one of the following:

  1. Download Automake (version 1.2 or later) from your nearest GNU
     mirror, install it, and start using it.

  2. Learn how to write `Makefile' rules by hand.  They're sometimes
     complex, but if you're clever enough to write rules for compiling
     your old libraries, then you should be able to figure out new
     rules for libtool libraries (hint: examine the `Makefile.in' in
     the `demo' subdirectory of the libtool distribution... note
     especially that it was automatically generated from the
     `Makefile.am' by Automake).


File: libtool.info,  Node: Using Automake,  Next: Configuring,  Prev: Makefile rules,  Up: Integrating libtool

Using Automake with libtool
===========================

   Libtool library support is implemented under the `LTLIBRARIES'
primary.

   Here are some samples from the Automake `Makefile.am' in the libtool
distribution's `demo' subdirectory.

   First, to link a program against a libtool library, just use the
`program_LDADD' variable:

     bin_PROGRAMS = hell hell.debug
     
     # Build hell from main.c and libhello.la
     hell_SOURCES = main.c
     hell_LDADD = libhello.la
     
     # Create an easier-to-debug version of hell.
     hell_debug_SOURCES = main.c
     hell_debug_LDADD = libhello.la
     hell_debug_LDFLAGS = -static

   The flags `-dlopen' or `-dlpreopen' (*note Link mode::) would fit
better in the PROGRAM_LDADD variable.  Unfortunately, GNU automake, up
to release 1.4, doesn't accept these flags in a PROGRAM_LDADD variable,
so you have the following alternatives:

   * add them to PROGRAM_LDFLAGS, and list the libraries in
     PROGRAM_DEPENDENCIES, then wait for a release of GNU automake that
     accepts these flags where they belong;

   * surround the flags between quotes, but then you must set
     PROGRAM_DEPENDENCIES too:

          program_LDADD = "-dlopen" libfoo.la
          program_DEPENDENCIES = libfoo.la

   * set and `AC_SUBST' variables DLOPEN and DLPREOPEN in
     `configure.in' and use `@DLOPEN@' and `@DLPREOPEN@' as
     replacements for the explicit flags `-dlopen' and `-dlpreopen' in
     `program_LDADD'.  Automake will discard `AC_SUBST'ed variables
     from dependencies, so it will behave exactly as we expect it to
     behave when it accepts these flags in `program_LDADD'.  But hey!,
     this is ugly!

   You may use the `program_LDFLAGS' variable to stuff in any flags you
want to pass to libtool while linking `program' (such as `-static' to
avoid linking uninstalled shared libtool libraries).

   Building a libtool library is almost as trivial... note the use of
`libhello_la_LDFLAGS' to pass the `-version-info' (*note Versioning::)
option to libtool:

     # Build a libtool library, libhello.la for installation in libdir.
     lib_LTLIBRARIES = libhello.la
     libhello_la_SOURCES = hello.c foo.c
     libhello_la_LDFLAGS = -version-info 3:12:1

   The `-rpath' option is passed automatically by Automake (except for
libraries listed as `noinst_LTLIBRARIES'), so you should not specify it.

more information.

Configuring libtool
===================

   Libtool requires intimate knowledge of your compiler suite and
operating system in order to be able to create shared libraries and
link against them properly.  When you install the libtool distribution,
a system-specific libtool script is installed into your binary
directory.

   However, when you distribute libtool with your own packages (*note
Distributing::), you do not always know which compiler suite and
operating system are used to compile your package.

   For this reason, libtool must be "configured" before it can be used.
This idea should be familiar to anybody who has used a GNU `configure'
script.  `configure' runs a number of tests for system features, then
generates the `Makefiles' (and possibly a `config.h' header file),
after which you can run `make' and build the package.

   Libtool adds its own tests to your `configure' script in order to
generate a libtool script for the installer's host machine.

* Menu:

* AC_PROG_LIBTOOL::             Configuring `libtool' in `configure.in'.


File: libtool.info,  Node: AC_PROG_LIBTOOL,  Up: Configuring

The `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' macro
---------------------------

   If you are using GNU Autoconf (or Automake), you should add a call to
`AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' to your `configure.in' file.  This macro adds many
new tests to the `configure' script so that the generated libtool
script will understand the characteristics of the host:

 - Macro: AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
 - Macro: AM_PROG_LIBTOOL
     Add support for the `--enable-shared' and `--disable-shared'
     `configure' flags.(1)  `AM_PROG_LIBTOOL' was the old name for this
     macro, and although supported at the moment is deprecated.

     By default, this macro turns on shared libraries if they are
     available, and also enables static libraries if they don't
     conflict with the shared libraries.  You can modify these defaults
     by calling either the `AC_DISABLE_SHARED' or `AC_DISABLE_STATIC'
     macros:

          # Turn off shared libraries during beta-testing, since they
          # make the build process take too long.
          AC_DISABLE_SHARED
          AC_PROG_LIBTOOL

     The user may specify modified forms of the configure flags
     `--enable-shared' and `--enable-static' to choose whether shared
     or static libraries are built based on the name of the package.
     For example, to have shared `bfd' and `gdb' libraries built, but
     not shared `libg++', you can run all three `configure' scripts as
     follows:

          trick$ ./configure --enable-shared=bfd,gdb

     In general, specifying `--enable-shared=PKGS' is the same as
     configuring with `--enable-shared' every package named in the
     comma-separated PKGS list, and every other package with
     `--disable-shared'.  The `--enable-static=PKGS' flag behaves
     similarly, but it uses `--enable-static' and `--disable-static'.
     The same applies to the `--enable-fast-install=PKGS' flag, which
     uses `--enable-fast-install' and `--disable-fast-install'.

     The package name `default' matches any packages which have not set
     their name in the `PACKAGE' environment variable.

     This macro also sets the shell variable LIBTOOL_DEPS, that you can
     use to automatically update the libtool script if it becomes
     out-of-date.  In order to do that, add to your `configure.in':

          AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
          AC_SUBST(LIBTOOL_DEPS)

     and, to `Makefile.in' or `Makefile.am':

          LIBTOOL_DEPS = @LIBTOOL_DEPS@
          libtool: $(LIBTOOL_DEPS)
                  $(SHELL) ./config.status --recheck

     If you are using GNU automake, you can omit the assignment, as
     automake will take care of it.  You'll obviously have to create
     some dependency on `libtool'.


 - Macro: AC_LIBTOOL_DLOPEN
     Enable checking for dlopen support. This macro should be used if
     the package makes use of the `-dlopen' and `-dlpreopen' flags,
     otherwise libtool will assume that the system does not support
     dlopening.  The macro must be called *before* `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'.

 - Macro: AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL
     This macro should be used if the package has been ported to build
     clean dlls on win32 platforms.  Usually this means that any
     library data items are exported with `__declspec(dllexport)' and
     imported with `__declspec(dllimport)'.  If this macro is not used,
     libtool will assume that the package libraries are not dll clean
     and will build only static libraries on win32 hosts.

     This macro must be called *before* `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL', and
     provision must be made to pass `-no-undefined' to `libtool' in
     link mode from the package `Makefile'.  Naturally, if you pass
     `-no-undefined', you must ensure that all the library symbols
     *really are* defined at link time!

 - Macro: AC_DISABLE_FAST_INSTALL
     Change the default behaviour for `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' to disable
     optimization for fast installation.  The user may still override
     this default, depending on platform support, by specifying
     `--enable-fast-install'.

 - Macro: AC_DISABLE_SHARED
 - Macro: AM_DISABLE_SHARED
     Change the default behaviour for `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' to disable
     shared libraries.  The user may still override this default by
     specifying `--enable-shared'.

 - Macro: AC_DISABLE_STATIC
 - Macro: AM_DISABLE_STATIC
     Change the default behaviour for `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' to disable
     static libraries.  The user may still override this default by
     specifying `--enable-static'.

   The tests in `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' also recognize the following
environment variables:

 - Variable: CC
     The C compiler that will be used by the generated `libtool'.  If
     this is not set, `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' will look for `gcc' or `cc'.

 - Variable: CFLAGS
     Compiler flags used to generate standard object files.  If this is
     not set, `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' will not use any such flags.  It affects
     only the way `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' runs tests, not the produced
     `libtool'.

 - Variable: CPPFLAGS
     C preprocessor flags.  If this is not set, `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' will
     not use any such flags.  It affects only the way `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'
     runs tests, not the produced `libtool'.

 - Variable: LD
     The system linker to use (if the generated `libtool' requires one).
     If this is not set, `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' will try to find out what is
     the linker used by CC.

 - Variable: LDFLAGS
     The flags to be used by `libtool' when it links a program.  If
     this is not set, `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' will not use any such flags.  It
     affects only the way `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' runs tests, not the produced
     `libtool'.

 - Variable: LIBS
     The libraries to be used by `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' when it links a
     program.  If this is not set, `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' will not use any
     such flags.  It affects only the way `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' runs tests,
     not the produced `libtool'.

 - Variable: NM
     Program to use rather than checking for `nm'.

 - Variable: RANLIB
     Program to use rather than checking for `ranlib'.

 - Variable: LN_S
     A command that creates a link of a program, a soft-link if
     possible, a hard-link otherwise.  `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' will check for
     a suitable program if this variable is not set.

 - Variable: DLLTOOL
     Program to use rather than checking for `dlltool'.  Only meaningful
     for Cygwin/MS-Windows.

 - Variable: OBJDUMP
     Program to use rather than checking for `objdump'.  Only meaningful
     for Cygwin/MS-Windows.

 - Variable: AS
     Program to use rather than checking for `as'.  Only used on
     Cygwin/MS-Windows at the moment.

   When you invoke the `libtoolize' program (*note Invoking
libtoolize::), it will tell you where to find a definition of
`AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'.  If you use Automake, the `aclocal' program will
automatically add `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' support to your `configure' script.

   Nevertheless, it is advisable to include a copy of `libtool.m4' in
`acinclude.m4', so that, even if `aclocal.m4' and `configure' are
rebuilt for any reason, the appropriate libtool macros will be used.
The alternative is to hope the user will have a compatible version of
`libtool.m4' installed and accessible for `aclocal'.  This may lead to
weird errors when versions don't match.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' requires that you define the `Makefile'
variable `top_builddir' in your `Makefile.in'.  Automake does this
automatically, but Autoconf users should set it to the relative path to
the top of your build directory (`../..', for example).

Including libtool in your package
=================================

   In order to use libtool, you need to include the following files with
your package:

`config.guess'
     Attempt to guess a canonical system name.

`config.sub'
     Canonical system name validation subroutine script.

`ltmain.sh'
     A generic script implementing basic libtool functionality.

   Note that the libtool script itself should _not_ be included with
your package.  *Note Configuring::.

   You should use the `libtoolize' program, rather than manually
copying these files into your package.

* Menu:

* Invoking libtoolize::         `libtoolize' command line options.
* Autoconf .o macros::          Autoconf macros that set object file names.


File: libtool.info,  Node: Invoking libtoolize,  Next: Autoconf .o macros,  Up: Distributing

Invoking `libtoolize'
---------------------

   The `libtoolize' program provides a standard way to add libtool
support to your package.  In the future, it may implement better usage
checking, or other features to make libtool even easier to use.

   The `libtoolize' program has the following synopsis:

     libtoolize [OPTION]...

and accepts the following options:

`--automake'
     Work silently, and assume that Automake libtool support is used.

     `libtoolize --automake' is used by Automake to add libtool files to
     your package, when `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' appears in your
     `configure.in'.

`--copy'
`-c'
     Copy files from the libtool data directory rather than creating
     symlinks.

`--debug'
     Dump a trace of shell script execution to standard output.  This
     produces a lot of output, so you may wish to pipe it to `less' (or
     `more') or redirect to a file.

`--dry-run'
`-n'
     Don't run any commands that modify the file system, just print them
     out.

`--force'
`-f'
     Replace existing libtool files.  By default, `libtoolize' won't
     overwrite existing files.

`--help'
     Display a help message and exit.

`--ltdl'
     Install libltdl in a subdirectory of your package.

`--ltdl-tar'
     Add the file libltdl.tar.gz to your package.

`--version'
     Print `libtoolize' version information and exit.

   If `libtoolize' detects an explicit call to `AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR'
(*note The Autoconf Manual: (autoconf)Input.) in your `configure.in', it
will put the files in the specified directory.

   `libtoolize' displays hints for adding libtool support to your
package, as well.


File: libtool.info,  Node: Autoconf .o macros,  Prev: Invoking libtoolize,  Up: Distributing

Autoconf `.o' macros
--------------------

   The Autoconf package comes with a few macros that run tests, then
set a variable corresponding to the name of an object file.  Sometimes
it is necessary to use corresponding names for libtool objects.

   Here are the names of variables that list libtool objects:

 - Variable: LTALLOCA
     Substituted by `AC_FUNC_ALLOCA' (*note Particular Function Checks:
     (autoconf)Particular Functions.).  Is either empty, or contains
     `alloca.lo'.

 - Variable: LTLIBOBJS
     Substituted by `AC_REPLACE_FUNCS' (*note Generic Function Checks:
     (autoconf)Generic Functions.), and a few other functions.

   Unfortunately, the stable release of Autoconf (2.13, at the time of
this writing) does not have any way for libtool to provide support for
these variables.  So, if you depend on them, use the following code
immediately before the call to `AC_OUTPUT' in your `configure.in':

     LTLIBOBJS=`echo "$LIBOBJS" | sed 's/\.[^.]* /.lo /g;s/\.[^.]*$/.lo/'`
     AC_SUBST(LTLIBOBJS)
     LTALLOCA=`echo "$ALLOCA" | sed 's/\.[^.]* /.lo /g;s/\.[^.]*$/.lo/'`
     AC_SUBST(LTALLOCA)
     AC_OUTPUT(...)


File: libtool.info,  Node: Static-only libraries,  Prev: Distributing,  Up: Integrating libtool

Static-only libraries
=====================

   When you are developing a package, it is often worthwhile to
configure your package with the `--disable-shared' flag, or to override
the defaults for `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' by using the `AC_DISABLE_SHARED'
Autoconf macro (*note The `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' macro: AC_PROG_LIBTOOL.).
This prevents libtool from building shared libraries, which has several
advantages:

   * compilation is twice as fast, which can speed up your development
     cycle,

   * debugging is easier because you don't need to deal with any
     complexities added by shared libraries, and

   * you can see how libtool behaves on static-only platforms.

   You may want to put a small note in your package `README' to let
other developers know that `--disable-shared' can save them time.  The
following example note is taken from the GIMP(1) distribution `README':

     The GIMP uses GNU Libtool in order to build shared libraries on a
     variety of systems. While this is very nice for making usable
     binaries, it can be a pain when trying to debug a program. For that
     reason, compilation of shared libraries can be turned off by
     specifying the `--disable-shared' option to `configure'.

Library interface versions
**************************

   The most difficult issue introduced by shared libraries is that of
creating and resolving runtime dependencies.  Dependencies on programs
and libraries are often described in terms of a single name, such as
`sed'.  So, one may say "libtool depends on sed," and that is good
enough for most purposes.

   However, when an interface changes regularly, we need to be more
specific: "Gnus 5.1 requires Emacs 19.28 or above."  Here, the
description of an interface consists of a name, and a "version number."

   Even that sort of description is not accurate enough for some
purposes.  What if Emacs 20 changes enough to break Gnus 5.1?

   The same problem exists in shared libraries: we require a formal
version system to describe the sorts of dependencies that programs have
on shared libraries, so that the dynamic linker can guarantee that
programs are linked only against libraries that provide the interface
they require.

* Menu:

* Interfaces::                  What are library interfaces?
* Libtool versioning::          Libtool's versioning system.
* Updating version info::       Changing version information before releases.
* Release numbers::             Breaking binary compatibility for aesthetics.


File: libtool.info,  Node: Interfaces,  Next: Libtool versioning,  Up: Versioning

What are library interfaces?
============================

   Interfaces for libraries may be any of the following (and more):

   * global variables: both names and types

   * global functions: argument types and number, return types, and
     function names

   * standard input, standard output, standard error, and file formats

   * sockets, pipes, and other inter-process communication protocol
     formats

   Note that static functions do not count as interfaces, because they
are not directly available to the user of the library.


File: libtool.info,  Node: Libtool versioning,  Next: Updating version info,  Prev: Interfaces,  Up: Versioning

Libtool's versioning system
===========================

   Libtool has its own formal versioning system.  It is not as flexible
as some, but it is definitely the simplest of the more powerful
versioning systems.

   Think of a library as exporting several sets of interfaces,
arbitrarily represented by integers.  When a program is linked against
a library, it may use any subset of those interfaces.

   Libtool's description of the interfaces that a program uses is
simple: it encodes the least and the greatest interface numbers in the
resulting binary (FIRST-INTERFACE, LAST-INTERFACE).

   The dynamic linker is guaranteed that if a library supports _every_
interface number between FIRST-INTERFACE and LAST-INTERFACE, then the
program can be relinked against that library.

   Note that this can cause problems because libtool's compatibility
requirements are actually stricter than is necessary.

   Say `libhello' supports interfaces 5, 16, 17, 18, and 19, and that
libtool is used to link `test' against `libhello'.

   Libtool encodes the numbers 5 and 19 in `test', and the dynamic
linker will only link `test' against libraries that support _every_
interface between 5 and 19.  So, the dynamic linker refuses to link
`test' against `libhello'!

   In order to eliminate this problem, libtool only allows libraries to
declare consecutive interface numbers.  So, `libhello' can declare at
most that it supports interfaces 16 through 19.  Then, the dynamic
linker will link `test' against `libhello'.

   So, libtool library versions are described by three integers:

CURRENT
     The most recent interface number that this library implements.

REVISION
     The implementation number of the CURRENT interface.

AGE
     The difference between the newest and oldest interfaces that this
     library implements.  In other words, the library implements all the
     interface numbers in the range from number `CURRENT - AGE' to
     `CURRENT'.

   If two libraries have identical CURRENT and AGE numbers, then the
dynamic linker chooses the library with the greater REVISION number.

Updating library version information
====================================

   If you want to use libtool's versioning system, then you must specify
the version information to libtool using the `-version-info' flag
during link mode (*note Link mode::).

   This flag accepts an argument of the form
`CURRENT[:REVISION[:AGE]]'.  So, passing `-version-info 3:12:1' sets
CURRENT to 3, REVISION to 12, and AGE to 1.

   If either REVISION or AGE are omitted, they default to 0.  Also note
that AGE must be less than or equal to the CURRENT interface number.

   Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version
information:

  1. Start with version information of `0:0:0' for each libtool library.

  2. Update the version information only immediately before a public
     release of your software.  More frequent updates are unnecessary,
     and only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger
     faster.

  3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last
     update, then increment REVISION (`C:R:A' becomes `C:r+1:A').

  4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
     last update, increment CURRENT, and set REVISION to 0.

  5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
     then increment AGE.

  6. If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release,
     then set AGE to 0.

   *_Never_* try to set the interface numbers so that they correspond
to the release number of your package.  This is an abuse that only
fosters misunderstanding of the purpose of library versions.  Instead,
use the `-release' flag (*note Release numbers::), but be warned that
every release of your package will not be binary compatible with any
other release.


File: libtool.info,  Node: Release numbers,  Prev: Updating version info,  Up: Versioning

Managing release information
============================

   Often, people want to encode the name of the package release into the
shared library so that it is obvious to the user which package their
programs are linked against.  This convention is used especially on
GNU/Linux:

     trick$ ls /usr/lib/libbfd*
     /usr/lib/libbfd.a	    /usr/lib/libbfd.so.2.7.0.2
     /usr/lib/libbfd.so
     trick$

   On `trick', `/usr/lib/libbfd.so' is a symbolic link to
`libbfd.so.2.7.0.2', which was distributed as a part of
`binutils-2.7.0.2'.

   Unfortunately, this convention conflicts directly with libtool's
idea of library interface versions, because the library interface
rarely changes at the same time that the release number does, and the
library suffix is never the same across all platforms.

   So, in order to accommodate both views, you can use the `-release'
flag in order to set release information for libraries which you do not
want to use `-version-info'.  For the `libbfd' example, the next
release which uses libtool should be built with `-release 2.9.0', which
will produce the following files on GNU/Linux:

     trick$ ls /usr/lib/libbfd*
     /usr/lib/libbfd-2.9.0.so     /usr/lib/libbfd.a
     /usr/lib/libbfd.so
     trick$

   In this case, `/usr/lib/libbfd.so' is a symbolic link to
`libbfd-2.9.0.so'.  This makes it obvious that the user is dealing with
`binutils-2.9.0', without compromising libtool's idea of interface
versions.

   Note that this option causes a modification of the library name, so
do not use it unless you want to break binary compatibility with any
past library releases.  In general, you should only use `-release' for
package-internal libraries or for ones whose interfaces change very
frequently.

Tips for interface design
*************************

   Writing a good library interface takes a lot of practice and thorough
understanding of the problem that the library is intended to solve.

   If you design a good interface, it won't have to change often, you
won't have to keep updating documentation, and users won't have to keep
relearning how to use the library.

   Here is a brief list of tips for library interface design, which may
help you in your exploits:

Plan ahead
     Try to make every interface truly minimal, so that you won't need
     to delete entry points very often.

Avoid interface changes
     Some people love redesigning and changing entry points just for
     the heck of it (note: _renaming_ a function is considered changing
     an entry point).  Don't be one of those people.  If you must
     redesign an interface, then try to leave compatibility functions
     behind so that users don't need to rewrite their existing code.

Use opaque data types
     The fewer data type definitions a library user has access to, the
     better.  If possible, design your functions to accept a generic
     pointer (which you can cast to an internal data type), and provide
     access functions rather than allowing the library user to directly
     manipulate the data.  That way, you have the freedom to change the
     data structures without changing the interface.

     This is essentially the same thing as using abstract data types and
     inheritance in an object-oriented system.

Use header files
     If you are careful to document each of your library's global
     functions and variables in header files, and include them in your
     library source files, then the compiler will let you know if you
     make any interface changes by accident (*note C header files::).

Use the `static' keyword (or equivalent) whenever possible
     The fewer global functions your library has, the more flexibility
     you'll have in changing them.  Static functions and variables may
     change forms as often as you like... your users cannot access
     them, so they aren't interface changes.

Be careful with array dimensions
     The number of elements in a global array is part of an interface,
     even if the header just declares `extern int foo[];'.  This is
     because on i386 and some other SVR4/ELF systems, when an
     application references data in a shared library the size of that
     data (whatever its type) is included in the application
     executable.  If you might want to change the size of an array or
     string then provide a pointer not the actual array.

* C header files::              How to write portable include files.


File: libtool.info,  Node: C header files,  Up: Library tips

Writing C header files
======================

   Writing portable C header files can be difficult, since they may be
read by different types of compilers:

C++ compilers
     C++ compilers require that functions be declared with full
     prototypes, since C++ is more strongly typed than C.  C functions
     and variables also need to be declared with the `extern "C"'
     directive, so that the names aren't mangled.  *Note C++
     libraries::, for other issues relevant to using C++ with libtool.

ANSI C compilers
     ANSI C compilers are not as strict as C++ compilers, but functions
     should be prototyped to avoid unnecessary warnings when the header
     file is `#include'd.

non-ANSI C compilers
     Non-ANSI compilers will report errors if functions are prototyped.

   These complications mean that your library interface headers must use
some C preprocessor magic in order to be usable by each of the above
compilers.

   `foo.h' in the `demo' subdirectory of the libtool distribution
serves as an example for how to write a header file that can be safely
installed in a system directory.

   Here are the relevant portions of that file:

     /* BEGIN_C_DECLS should be used at the beginning of your declarations,
        so that C++ compilers don't mangle their names.  Use END_C_DECLS at
        the end of C declarations. */
     #undef BEGIN_C_DECLS
     #undef END_C_DECLS
     #ifdef __cplusplus
     # define BEGIN_C_DECLS extern "C" {
     # define END_C_DECLS }
     #else
     # define BEGIN_C_DECLS /* empty */
     # define END_C_DECLS /* empty */
     #endif
     
     /* PARAMS is a macro used to wrap function prototypes, so that
        compilers that don't understand ANSI C prototypes still work,
        and ANSI C compilers can issue warnings about type mismatches. */
     #undef PARAMS
     #if defined (__STDC__) || defined (_AIX) \
             || (defined (__mips) && defined (_SYSTYPE_SVR4)) \
             || defined(WIN32) || defined(__cplusplus)
     # define PARAMS(protos) protos
     #else
     # define PARAMS(protos) ()
     #endif

   These macros are used in `foo.h' as follows:

     #ifndef FOO_H
     #define FOO_H 1
     
     /* The above macro definitions. */
     #include "..."
     
     BEGIN_C_DECLS
     
     int foo PARAMS((void));
     int hello PARAMS((void));
     
     END_C_DECLS
     
     #endif /* !FOO_H */

   Note that the `#ifndef FOO_H' prevents the body of `foo.h' from
being read more than once in a given compilation.

   Also the only thing that must go outside the
`BEGIN_C_DECLS'/`END_C_DECLS' pair are `#include' lines.  Strictly
speaking it is only C symbol names that need to be protected, but your
header files will be more maintainable if you have a single pair of of
these macros around the majority of the header contents.

   You should use these definitions of `PARAMS', `BEGIN_C_DECLS', and
`END_C_DECLS' into your own headers.  Then, you may use them to create
header files that are valid for C++, ANSI, and non-ANSI compilers(1).

   Do not be naive about writing portable code.  Following the tips
given above will help you miss the most obvious problems, but there are
definitely other subtle portability issues.  You may need to cope with
some of the following issues:

   * Pre-ANSI compilers do not always support the `void *' generic
     pointer type, and so need to use `char *' in its place.

   * The `const', `inline' and `signed' keywords are not supported by
     some compilers, especially pre-ANSI compilers.

   * The `long double' type is not supported by many compilers.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) We used to recommend `__P', `__BEGIN_DECLS' and `__END_DECLS'.
This was bad advice since symbols (even preprocessor macro names) that
begin with an underscore are reserved for the use of the compiler.

Inter-library dependencies
**************************

   By definition, every shared library system provides a way for
executables to depend on libraries, so that symbol resolution is
deferred until runtime.

   An "inter-library dependency" is one in which a library depends on
other libraries.  For example, if the libtool library `libhello' uses
the `cos' function, then it has an inter-library dependency on `libm',
the math library that implements `cos'.

   Some shared library systems provide this feature in an
internally-consistent way: these systems allow chains of dependencies of
potentially infinite length.

   However, most shared library systems are restricted in that they only
allow a single level of dependencies.  In these systems, programs may
depend on shared libraries, but shared libraries may not depend on other
shared libraries.

   In any event, libtool provides a simple mechanism for you to declare
inter-library dependencies: for every library `libNAME' that your own
library depends on, simply add a corresponding `-lNAME' option to the
link line when you create your library.  To make an example of our
`libhello' that depends on `libm':

     burger$ libtool --mode=link gcc -g -O -o libhello.la foo.lo hello.lo \
                     -rpath /usr/local/lib -lm
     burger$

   When you link a program against `libhello', you don't need to
specify the same `-l' options again: libtool will do that for you, in
order to guarantee that all the required libraries are found.  This
restriction is only necessary to preserve compatibility with static
library systems and simple dynamic library systems.

   Some platforms, such as AIX, do not even allow you this flexibility.
In order to build a shared library, it must be entirely self-contained
(that is, have references only to symbols that are found in the `.lo'
files or the specified `-l' libraries), and you need to specify the
-NO-UNDEFINED flag.  By default, libtool builds only static libraries
on these kinds of platforms.

   The simple-minded inter-library dependency tracking code of libtool
releases prior to 1.2 was disabled because it was not clear when it was
possible to link one library with another, and complex failures would
occur.  A more complex implementation of this concept was re-introduced
before release 1.3, but it has not been ported to all platforms that
libtool supports.  The default, conservative behavior is to avoid
linking one library with another, introducing their inter-dependencies
only when a program is linked with them.

Dlopened modules
****************

   It can sometimes be confusing to discuss "dynamic linking", because
the term is used to refer to two different concepts:

  1. Compiling and linking a program against a shared library, which is
     resolved automatically at run time by the dynamic linker.  In this
     process, dynamic linking is transparent to the application.

  2. The application calling functions such as `dlopen',(1) which load
     arbitrary, user-specified modules at runtime.  This type of dynamic
     linking is explicitly controlled by the application.

   To mitigate confusion, this manual refers to the second type of
dynamic linking as "dlopening" a module.

   The main benefit to dlopening object modules is the ability to access
compiled object code to extend your program, rather than using an
interpreted language.  In fact, dlopen calls are frequently used in
language interpreters to provide an efficient way to extend the
language.

   As of version 1.5, libtool provides support for dlopened modules.
However, you should indicate that your package is willing to use such
support, by using the macro `AC_LIBTOOL_DLOPEN' in `configure.in'.  If
this macro is not used (or it is used _after_ `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'),
libtool will assume no dlopening mechanism is available, and will try
to simulate it.

   This chapter discusses how you as a dlopen application developer
might use libtool to generate dlopen-accessible modules.

Building modules to dlopen
==========================

   On some operating systems, a program symbol must be specially
declared in order to be dynamically resolved with the `dlsym' (or
equivalent) function.

   Libtool provides the `-export-dynamic' and `-module' link flags
(*note Link mode::), which do this declaration.  You need to use these
flags if you are linking an application program that dlopens other
modules or a libtool library that will also be dlopened.

   For example, if we wanted to build a shared library, `libhello',
that would later be dlopened by an application, we would add `-module'
to the other link flags:

     burger$ libtool --mode=link gcc -module -o libhello.la foo.lo \
                     hello.lo -rpath /usr/local/lib -lm
     burger$

   If symbols from your _executable_ are needed to satisfy unresolved
references in a library you want to dlopen you will have to use the flag
`-export-dynamic'.  You should use `-export-dynamic' while linking the
executable that calls dlopen:

     burger$ libtool --mode=link gcc -export-dynamic -o hell-dlopener main.o
     burger$


File: libtool.info,  Node: Dlpreopening,  Next: Finding the dlname,  Prev: Building modules,  Up: Dlopened modules

Dlpreopening
============

   Libtool provides special support for dlopening libtool object and
libtool library files, so that their symbols can be resolved _even on
platforms without any `dlopen' and `dlsym' functions_.

   Consider the following alternative ways of loading code into your
program, in order of increasing "laziness":

  1. Linking against object files that become part of the program
     executable, whether or not they are referenced.  If an object file
     cannot be found, then the linker refuses to create the executable.

  2. Declaring a static library to the linker, so that it is searched
     at link time in order to satisfy any undefined references in the
     above object files.  If the static library cannot be found, then
     the linker refuses to link the executable.

  3. Declaring a shared library to the runtime linker, so that it is
     searched at runtime in order to satisfy any undefined references
     in the above files.  If the shared library cannot be found, then
     the dynamic linker aborts the program before it runs.

  4. Dlopening a module, so that the application can resolve its own,
     dynamically-computed references.  If there is an error opening the
     module, or the module is not found, then the application can
     recover without crashing.

   Libtool emulates `-dlopen' on static platforms by linking objects
into the program at compile time, and creating data structures that
represent the program's symbol table.

   In order to use this feature, you must declare the objects you want
your application to dlopen by using the `-dlopen' or `-dlpreopen' flags
when you link your program (*note Link mode::).

 - Structure: struct lt_dlsymlist { const char *NAME; lt_ptr ADDRESS; }
     The NAME attribute is a null-terminated character string of the
     symbol name, such as `"fprintf"'.  The ADDRESS attribute is a
     generic pointer to the appropriate object, such as `&fprintf'.

 - Variable: const lt_dlsymlist * lt_preloaded_symbols
     An array of LT_SYMBOL structures, representing all the preloaded
     symbols linked into the program. For each `-dlpreloaded' file
     there is an element with the NAME of the file and a ADDRESS of
     `0', followed by all symbols exported from this file.  For the
     executable itself the special name @PROGRAM@ is used.  The last
     element has a NAME and ADDRESS of `0'.

   Some compilers may allow identifiers which are not valid in ANSI C,
such as dollar signs.  Libtool only recognizes valid ANSI C symbols (an
initial ASCII letter or underscore, followed by zero or more ASCII
letters, digits, and underscores), so non-ANSI symbols will not appear
in LT_PRELOADED_SYMBOLS.

Finding the correct name to dlopen
==================================

   After a library has been linked with `-module', it can be dlopened.
Unfortunately, because of the variation in library names, your package
needs to determine the correct file to dlopen.

   The most straightforward and flexible implementation is to determine
the name at runtime, by finding the installed `.la' file, and searching
it for the following lines:

     # The name that we can `dlopen'.
     dlname='DLNAME'

   If DLNAME is empty, then the library cannot be dlopened.  Otherwise,
it gives the dlname of the library.  So, if the library was installed
as `/usr/local/lib/libhello.la', and the DLNAME was `libhello.so.3',
then `/usr/local/lib/libhello.so.3' should be dlopened.

   If your program uses this approach, then it should search the
directories listed in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH'(1) environment variable, as
well as the directory where libraries will eventually be installed.
Searching this variable (or equivalent) will guarantee that your
program can find its dlopened modules, even before installation,
provided you have linked them using libtool.

Unresolved dlopen issues
========================

   The following problems are not solved by using libtool's dlopen
support:

   * Dlopen functions are generally only available on shared library
     platforms.  If you want your package to be portable to static
     platforms, you have to use either libltdl (*note Using libltdl::)
     or develop your own alternatives to dlopening dynamic code.  Most
     reasonable solutions involve writing wrapper functions for the
     `dlopen' family, which do package-specific tricks when dlopening
     is unsupported or not available on a given platform.

   * There are major differences in implementations of the `dlopen'
     family of functions.  Some platforms do not even use the same
     function names (notably HP-UX, with its `shl_load' family).

   * The application developer must write a custom search function in
     order to discover the correct module filename to supply to
     `dlopen'.

Using libltdl
*************

   Libtool provides a small library, called `libltdl', that aims at
hiding the various difficulties of dlopening libraries from programmers.
It consists of a header-file and a small C source file that can be
distributed with applications that need dlopening functionality.  On
some platforms, whose dynamic linkers are too limited for a simple
implementation of `libltdl' services, it requires GNU DLD, or it will
only emulate dynamic linking with libtool's dlpreopening mechanism.

libltdl supports currently the following dynamic linking mechanisms:

   * `dlopen' (Solaris, Linux and various BSD flavors)

   * `shl_load' (HP-UX)

   * `LoadLibrary' (Win16 and Win32)

   * `load_add_on' (BeOS)

   * GNU DLD (emulates dynamic linking for static libraries)

   * libtool's dlpreopen (see *note Dlpreopening::)

libltdl is licensed under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License, with the following exception:
