INTRODUCTION:
</h4>
</a>

<P>
  This program is designed to match up items in two different
lists, which may have two different systems of coordinates.
The program allows the two sets of coordinates to be related
by a linear, quadratic, or cubic transformation.  It is an implementation
of the algorithm described in 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995PASP..107.1119V&db_key=AST&high=39463d35aa24090">

<h4>
PREPARING THE INPUT:
</h4>
</a>

<P>
  The user must place the objects to be matched in ASCII text
files, which have a fixed number of columns in each line.
Each file must have contain two spatial coordinates, i.e.
(row, col) or (x, y), and a "magnitude" for each item.
This is a measure of brightness, which has the peculiar 
property that bright items have SMALLER magnitudes than
faint ones. 
The user may optionally specify ID numbers for each star 
in a column.
An example might look like this:

<pre>
         5    368.77     3.93 11.369 0.027
         6     45.90     5.33 11.308 0.026
         7    407.27     5.05  6.650 0.001
         8    636.23     7.75 10.715 0.015
         9    338.60     8.90 11.314 0.026
</pre>

<P>
In the example above, 
the first column contains an "ID" number for each star,
the second column contains an "x" coordinate,
the third column a "y" coordinate, and the fourth column a "magnitude"
coordinate.  Note that the brightest item 
is number 7, and the faintest is number 5.

<P>
  Other columns may contain data of any type, as long as
each column contains no white space (tabs, spaces).  The
"x", "y" and "magnitude" (and, optionally, "ID") 
values must appear in the first
ten columns, but there may be additional columns beyond
the tenth.

<P>
  The "match" program adopts the C-like convention that the
leftmost column in a file is "number 0", the next column is
"number 1", and so forth.  Thus, in the example above,

<pre>
              column 0      has ID number
              column 1      has "x" coord
              column 2      has "y" coord
              column 3      has "magnitude" value
              column 4      has "magnitude error" value
</pre>

USAGE:
</h4>
</a>

<P>
  Usage is as follows:

<pre>
       match  fileA xcolA ycolA magcolA  fileB xcolB ycolB magcolB
                    [id1=] [id2=] [max_iter=] [halt_sigma=] 
                    [outfile=] [trirad=] [nobj=] [matchrad=] 
                    [scale=] [min_scale=] [max_scale=] [transonly] 
                    [recalc] [linear|quadratic|cubic]
                    [medtf] [medsigclip=]  [intrans=] [identity [xsh=] [ysh=]]
                    [--version] [--help] [help]

</pre>

<P>
The first 8 arguments are required, and must appear in the
order given above.  The remaining arguments are optional, and
may appear in any order.  The arguments are:

<pre>
     fileA          name of ASCII file containing items in the first list
     xcolA          column in fileA containing "x" value of items
     ycolA          column in fileA containing "y" value of items
     magcolA        column in fileA containing "mag" value of items
     fileB          name of ASCII file containing items in the second list
     xcolB          column in fileB containing "x" value of items
     ycolB          column in fileB containing "y" value of items
     magcolB        column in fileB containing "mag" value of items

     id1=N          column in fileA containing "ID" value of items
     id2=N          column in fileB containing "ID" value of items
                           (the values must be unique within each list;
                            the program will not check, and strange
                            behavior will result if duplicate IDs occur)

     outfile=abc    place output in files with base name "abc"
                           abc.mtA         those in A which do match
                           abc.mtB         those in A which do match
                           abc.unA         those in B which don't match
                           abc.unB         those in B which don't match

     trirad=0.001   critical value for counting triangles as a match
                          (default value 0.002; see below)
     nobj=30        use the brightest 'nobj' values in each list
                          during the matching process (default value 20)
     matchrad=4     after applying transformation to listA, so that both
                          lists are in coordinate system of listB, 
                          items from the two lists must be within this 
                          distance to count as 'matched'
                          (default value 5)

     scale=2.0      if present, only triangles with the given scale factor
                          are counted as matches (in this example, 
                          only triangles in coord system A which are
                          about 2.0 times larger than triangles in coord
                          system B are counted as matches)
     min_scale=1.5  if present, only triangles with ratios greater than
                          the given scale factor are counted as matches
     max_scale=2.5  if present, only triangles with ratios less than
                          the given scale factor are counted as matches

     max_iter=3     during the solution process, there is a loop in which
                          the code matches stars in the two lists, finds
                          the residuals for each pair, and discards pairs
                          with big residuals.  This argument sets a limit
                          on the number of times this loop can be entered.
                          Default value is given by AT_MATCH_MAXITER
                          parameter in atpmatch.h, currently 3.
     halt_sigma=1.0e-12
                          during the solution process, if the typical residual
                          between pairs of stars in the two lists drops
                          to this level, stop iterating and declare success.
                          The units are the square of the units in the
                          second list of stars; often, radians squared.
                          Default value is given by AT_MATCH_HALTSIGMA
                          parameter in atpmatch.h, currently 1.0e-12.

     transonly      if present, stop after having derived a transformation
                           which best takes the 'nobj' objects from list 
                           A into objects in list B.  Don't go on to
                           find the matching objects explicitly.
     recalc         if present, after having derived a transformation with
                           the brightest 'nobj' objects, and having applied
                           that transformation to ALL the objects in list A,
                           derive a transformation again, this time using
                           ALL the objects in list A and list B

     linear         use a linear transformation (the default)
     quadratic      use a quadratic transformation
     cubic          use a cubic transformation
	  
     medtf          calculate the MEDTF statistics (see below);
                           assumes that a simple translation connects
                           the two lists
     medsigclip=N   discard matched pairs more than N stdev from the
                           median offset before calculating MEDTF statistics

     identity       as an initial guess, use a linear TRANS in which there
                           is no rotation, change in scale, or translation
                           (unless xsh= and ysh= are specified)
     xsh=           in initial guess, use linear TRANS with the given 
                           translation in the 'x' direction
     ysh=           in initial guess, use linear TRANS with the given 
                           translation in the 'x' direction

     intrans=file   as an initial guess, use the TRANS which is given
                           in the ASCII text file 'file' (see below
                           for the format)

     --version      print the current version number and exit
     --help         print list of command-line options
     help           print list of command-line options

</pre>
                           

<P>
  Example: given two files with the format shown above, called
"starsA.dat" and "starsB.dat", one might call 'match' as follows:

<pre>
    match starsA.dat 1 2 3  starsB.dat 1 2 3 outfile=matched \
              id1=0 id2=0 matchrad=3.0 trirad=0.001 nobj=40 
</pre>

<P>
  The argument "trirad" may need some extra explanation.  For a full
desciption, see 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995PASP..107.1119V&db_key=AST&high=39463d35aa24090">
the paper by Valdes et al.  </a>
In short, stars are grouped
into triangles, the sides of which are labelled "a", "b" and "c"
in order of decreasing size.  The normalized ratios

<pre>
            b/a      and    c/a
</pre>

<P>
are formed for each triangle.  In order for a triangle, t1, from
one list to be considered identical to a triangle, t2, in the other
list, it must satisfy the equation

<pre>
     sqrt[ (t1.ba - t2.ba)^2 + (t1.ca - t2.ca)^2 ] <= trirad
</pre>

<P>
So the value of "trirad" has units of neither list; it exists
in a two-dimensional "triangle-space" formed by the coordinates
b/a and c/a (each of which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0).

<P>
One way the user can control the matching of triangles is to
specify a "scale factor".  Only triangles with a ratio of 
size falling with a particular window will be counted as
matches.
The user can control the "scale factor window" in two ways:
<UL>
<LI> using the <i>scale=</i> option alone; for example,
  <blockquote><tt>
             scale=1.5
  </tt></blockquote>
     The window is centered on the given factor, and 
	  extends a percentage (AT_MATCH_PERCENT) above it and below it.
<P>
<LI> using both <i>min_scale</i> and <i>max_scale</i> together; for example,
  <blockquote><tt>
             min_scale=1.3  max_scale=1.7
  </tt></blockquote>
     The window extends from the <i>min_scale</i> to <i>max_scale</i>,
	  including both boundaries.
</UL>

<P>
If the two lists are known to have the same scale and rotation,
the user may use the <i>identity</i> keyword to force an 
initial guess at the TRANS: a linear model with
<pre>
     a=0.0   b=1.0   c=0.0
     d=0.0   e=0.0   f=1.0
</pre>
The program will use this initial TRANS structure to match
up the items in the two lists, rather than trying to figure 
out the transformation itself.
After looking for matched items with this fixed model,
the program will use the matched pairs it finds to define
an improved TRANS.

<P>
In a similar vein, if the user knows that the scale and rotation
of the two sets of objects are identical, but there is a fixed
and known translation of <b>XX</b> units in the x-direction 
and <b>YY</b> units in the y-direction, he can use
the <i>identity</i> keyword with additional arguments
<pre>
     xsh=XX  ysh=YY
</pre>
which will create an initial TRANS with
<pre>
     a=XX    b=1.0   c=0.0
     d=YY    e=0.0   f=1.0
</pre>

<P>
Finally, for ultimate control, the user may specify the
exact values of the coefficients for the initial TRANS
via the <i>intrans=filename</i> option.
The program will look for an ASCII text file with
the given <i>filename</i>, which must have the following format:
<UL>
<LI> blank lines are skipped
<LI> lines starting with the '#' character are skipped
<LI> the first non-skipped line must describe the order of the model, either
         by one of the following keywords
  <UL>
  <LI> linear
  <LI> quadratic
  <LI> cubic
  </UL>
     or by a line like <tt>norder=NN</tt>, in which
	  <tt>NN</tt> has value 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, or 3 for cubic.
<LI> all following non-blank lines must give values for the coefficients
         of the specified TRANS model, in the general form
<pre>
      a=33.34
      b=1.3e-4
      c 99.01
      d -5.323e1
</pre>
     (note that the equals sign between the coefficient and the value
	  is optional)
</UL>

<P>
In any case, if the user specifies the initial TRANS, either 
via the <i>identity</i> or <i>intrans</i> method,
that initial model is used to convert the coordinates of 
objects in list A into the system of list B.
The program then looks for matches within the <i>matchrad</i> units.
It then uses only the matched pairs 
to generate an improved TRANS model.
        

<P>
On the other hand, if the user does NOT provide 
an initial TRANS model,
the program searches for one itself.
After its first guess,
the code matches up
candidate pairs of stars from the two lists.
It then enters a loop in which it calculates a plate solution,
applies the solution to the stars in list A, 
then compares the predicted positions from list A to the
actual positions of stars in list B.
Based on those residuals, the code marks some of the
pairs as "bad", discards them, and goes back to the top
of the loop.
The "max_iter" and "halt_sigma" arguments can be used 
to control the number of times the code enters this
loop and discards possible matches.
Note that, if one uses the 
<a name="project_coords"> project_coords </a>
routine to turn (RA, Dec) positions from a catalog
into an input list, 
the units will of this list will be radians;
hence, the residuals from a solution against this list
will be in radians squared.
A typical residual of 1 arcsec corresponds to 
"halt_sigma" of 2.4e-11 radians squared.

<h4>
OUTPUT: THE TRANS AND MEDTF STRUCTURES
</h4>
</a>

<P>
This "match" can send information directly to the screen
(as discussed in this section), or to auxiliary output files
(as discussed in the next section).  
If any errors occur during execution,
the program will print messages to the stdout stream.

<P>
<b>
TRANS structure
</b>

<P>
The only ordinary information sent to stdout is a description of the TRANS
structure, which converts coordinates in the file A to those
in file B.  A TRANS structure describes the transformation
between coordinates (x, y) and (x', y'):

<P>
  If the user has chosen the 'linear' option (which is the default),

<pre>
       x' = A + Bx + Cy
       y' = D + Ex + Fy
</pre>

<P>
  If the user has chosen the 'quadratic' option,

<pre>
       x' =  A + Bx + Cy + Dxx + Exy + Fyy
       y' =  G + Hx + Iy + Jxx + Kxy + Lyy
</pre>

<P>
  If the user has chosen the 'cubic' option,

<pre>
       x' =  A + Bx + Cy + Dxx + Exy + Fyy + Gx(xx+yy) + Hy(xx+yy)
       y' =  I + Jx + Ky + Lxx + Mxy + Nyy + Ox(xx+yy) + Py(xx+yy)
</pre>


<P>
The coefficients A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P are the members of 
the TRANS structure.  
In the case of a linear solution, one can interpret these values as follows:

<pre>
     - a, d: describe the translation between the two systems
     - b,c,d,e: describe rotation and magnification; if there
                is a good transformation, they should satisfy

                       b = +/-f      c = -/+e

                magnification = sqrt(b*b + c*c);
                rotation angle = atan(c/b);
</pre>

<P>
  Thus, in the example given above, in order to match the
coordinates of the items in the first list to those in the second
list, one must

<OL>
<LI> rotate by atan(-0.01/13.78) = 0.04 degrees
<LI> multiply by sqrt(13.78*13.78 + 0.01*0.01) = 13.78
<LI> add (-4543, 5918) 
</OL>


<P>
There are five additional members which describe the 
quality of the fit.
The program prints out their values in a form
like this (it prints out only the terms appropriate for the given order
of the transformation):

<pre>
TRANS: a=0.043180410     b=0.706908898     c=-0.706603954    d=0.053624825 
       e=0.706348660     f=0.708975359     sig=6.7655e-03    Nr=15    Nm=39
       sx=5.8321e-01     sy=2.3939e-01
</pre>

<P>
The final five elements always appear.  They are
<UL>
<dl>
<dt><tt> Nr </tt> </dt>
 <dd> the number of matched pairs of items used to define the 
                    transformation 
 </dd>
<dt><tt> sig </tt> </dt>
 <dd> the standard deviation of differences between these matched
                    pairs of items, in units of the coordinate system B
 </dd>
<dt><tt>  Nm </tt> </dt> 
 <dd> once _all_ items in file A have been transformed into
                    the coordinate system of file B, how many items
						  match within the <i>matchrad</i> distance?
 </dd>
<dt><tt> sx</tt> </dt> 
 <dd> once _all_ items in file A have been transformed into
                    the coordinate system of file B, what is the stdev of
                    differences in X-direction between matched items?
 </dd>
<dt><tt> sy</tt> </dt> 
 <dd> once _all_ items in file A have been transformed into
                    the coordinate system of file B, what is the stdev of
                    differences in Y-direction between matched items?
 </dd>
</dl>
</UL>
						  
<P>
Note the difference between <tt>sig</tt>, on the one hand, and
<tt>sx</tt> and <tt>sy</tt> on the other hand:
the former refers to (relatively few) pairs used to DEFINE the
transformation,
whereas the latter refer to the (many) pairs which appear
after items in file A are transformed into coord system of file B.

<P>
<b>
MEDTF structure
</b>
<P>
This information is produced only if the user requests 
it specifically, via the <i>medtf</i> and/or <i>medsigclip</i>
options.
The <b>MEDTF</b> structure contains information relevant to
a particular case of matching: two lists which have the
same scale and rotation, and are simply translated.
It arises so frequently that there are special routines
to measure how well one can match up these lists.

<P>
Suppose that two lists <i>can</i> be registered by a 
simply shift.  After registration, how many items 
in the two lists match --- and how well do their positions agree?
We measure the following quantities and then
set the corresponding elements of the <b>MEDTF</b> structure:
<UL>
<dl>
<dt> <tt>mdx, mdy</tt> </dt> 
  <dd> the median offset in each direction between
                            the two lists, after registration

The <b>MEDTF</b> information is printed to stdout (if requested)
in the following format (it all appears on a single line, which
I have broken into two pieces for clarity):

<pre>
MEDTF: mdx=1.000000000     mdy=0.000000000     adx=0.000000000     
       ady=0.052631579     sdx=0.973328527     sdy=0.686231832     n=19 
</pre>

The <b>MEDTF</b> line appears before the <b>TRANS</b> line in the output.

<P>
If the user specifies the <i>medsigclip</i> option, like so:
<pre>
       match filea.dat 1 2 3 fileb.dat linear medsigclip=3.0
</pre>
then an extra set of calculations are made after the 
two sets have been matched:
<OL>
<LI type="a"> Calculate the median, average, stdev of differences between
                positions, after matching.  If <i>medsigclip</i> is
					 not given, this is the final step of processing.
<LI> All pairs with distances more than the given number of standard
                deviations from the median (in either direction)
					 are discarded.
<LI> Re-calculate the median, average, stdev of differences for
                the surviving pairs.
</OL>

<P>
Strictly speaking, the <i>medtf</i> step requires
re-calculating the positions of all objects in list A,
after a valid TRANS has been found.
Therefore, the user should always specify 
<i>recalc</i> together with <i>medtf</i>.
However, the code will recognize the problem
if <i>medtf</i> alone is given on the command-line,
and set the <i>recalc</i> option itself.
The program will print a warning message to stdout
explaining its actions.

<P>
Likewise, the <i>medsigclip</i> option presupposes
<i>medtf</i> (and, hence, <i>recalc</i>);
once again, the program will recognize the situation
and set the required flags itself, giving
warnings to stdout.

<h4>
OUTPUT: LISTS OF MATCHED AND UNMATCHED ITEMS
</h4>
</a>

<P>
  The second type of output is the creation of 4 output files.
The files have names with the same base, which may be specified
by the user via the "outfile=" option, or defaults to "match".
There are 4 files, each of which contains 4 columns of numerical
information:

<pre>
      column 1:   an ID number, unique to each list
      column 2:   "x" coordinate, in the system of list B
      column 3:   "y" coordinate, in the system of list B
      column 4:   "mag" coordinate
</pre>

<P>
  The are 4 files with this format.  They are named (by default)

<pre>
      matched.mtA    items from list A which had matches in list B
      matched.mtB    items from list B which had matches in list A
      matched.unA    items from list A which had no matches in list B
      matched.unB    items from list B which had no matches in list A
</pre>

<P>
  The files "matched.mtA" and "matched.mtB" ought to have the same number
of entries.  The two files of unmatched items need not have the
same number of entries.

<P>
If the user has specified the "id1" and "id2" arguments, then the 
ID numbers in these output files are taken from the specified columns
in the input files.  
Otherwise, the program creates ID numbers which start at 0 in list A,
and increase monotonically to N-1, where "N" is the number of stars
in list A;
the ID numbers then start at N for the first star in list B, and continue
to increase to the end of list B.

HELPFUL HINTS
</h4>
</a>

<P>
If you know the relative scale of the two sets of objects, 
you should use the <i>scale</i>, or <i>min_scale</i> and <i>max_scale</i>,
options to narrow down the possible matches.

<P>
In the very common case that the two sets of objects have
(nearly) identical scale and rotation, and little translation,
use the <i>identity</i> option.
This will fail if there is an offset of more than the 
<i>matchrad</i> units between the lists;
if you know the offset even roughly,
use the <i>xsh=</i> and <i>ysh=</i> options
to improve the changes of finding a good match.

<P>
If the input are lists of stars from astronomical FITS images,
one might use the FITS header keywords
to determine the relative scale, rotation and/or translation,
create a file with the appropriate TRANS coefficients,
and then run the program with the <i>intrans=</i> option.


<P>
  The algorithm creates a set of all the triangles which can
be formed from the 'nobj' brightest members of each list:
this set grows as 'nobj' to the sixth power (!), so that
even a small increase in 'nobj' can lead to large increases
in run time.  The 'recalc' option can help: one may create two
very large lists of candidates -- say, 200 items in each --
and then set 'nobj' to some small subset of the total.  If all
goes well, the 'nobj' candidates will provide a rough transformation
without taking too long.  That transformation may be applied
to all 200 objects in each list, and then a better plate solution
can be calculated, quickly, using all the objects which match.

<P>
  For reference, given lists of 525 (detected in an image),
and 1338 (from the Guide Star Catalog) stars, and asked to 
use 40 stars from each list in the matching process, 'match'
took the following times to run:
                                                          MM:SS

<P>
  It is possible to get a lot of information on the program's
progress by setting the "#define DEBUG" flag in the source
code.  Setting the "#define DEBUG2" flag yields a LOT of 
information.

<P>
  Be careful to ensure that the two lists DO include stars
in common, within the 'nobj' brightest in each.  If one list
includes stars much brighter than the other, the 20 brightest
(for example) might not appear at all in the other list ...
in which case the matching algorithm will fail.

<P>
  The program does the best it can -- it may report
a TRANS even if a good match does not exist.  To verify that
the match is a valid one, make sure that the output ".mtA" and 
".mtB" files contain more than 1 or 2 entries.  If the 
TRANS coefficients don't satisfy b=+/-f and c=+/-e, it is likely
that any reported matches are spurious.

<P>
  Look at the file "atpmatch.h" for some constants that affect
program operation.  The #define'd constant AT_MATCH_REQUIRE,
for example, sets the minimum number of points in each list
which must exist.

<P>
  It may be possible to improve the program's performance on
some particular sort of data by tweaking some of the #define'd 
values in "atpmatch.h".  In particular, 

<pre>
#define AT_MATCH_PERCENTILE   0.65
#define AT_MATCH_NSIGMA       2.5
</pre>

control an interative sigma-clipping loop which discards the
worst stars in the current set of matches.  A low value of 
AT_MATCH_NSIGMA will cause the loop to iterate many times, 
discarding lots of stars, even if they aren't much worse than
the average.  A low value of AT_MATCH_PERCENTILE will do the
same, by lowering the percentile used as a stand-in for 
standard deviation and causing more pairs to qualify as "bad".

<P>
Another way to improve the performance on a particular
dataset is to fiddle with the 
"max_iter" and "halt_sigma" arguments.
It may be a good idea to start with very low values for
"max_iter", and large values for "halt_sigma", 
and look at the solutions by 
#define'ing DEBUG in "atpmatch.c".
One may then increase "max_iter", and decrease "halt_sigma",
and see how the solutions improve.



<P>
  The two lists of stars must have rectilinear coordinates for
this program to find a transformation connecting them.  Note
that (RA, Dec) is, in general, NOT such a system.  It is usually
necessary to project (RA, Dec) onto a plane tangent to the 
sphere at the center of the field.  However, for a field very
close to the celestial equator, (RA, Dec) can be close enough
to rectilinear for matching purposes.


<P>
  The matching procedure works best if the magnitude of the
two coordinate systems is not vastly different.  That is, 
these two sets of objects, with a scale factor of 1.4, 
are easily matched:

<pre>
          list A                       list B
       ( 50, 100)                   ( 70, 140)
       ( 20,  60)                   ( 28,  84)
       (-30,  40)                   (-42,  56)
</pre>

<P>
whereas these two sets, with a scale factor of 140000, might
fail to be matched:

<pre>
          list A                       list B
     ( 0.00050, 0.00100)            ( 70, 140)
     ( 0.00020, 0.00060)            ( 28,  84)
     (-0.00030, 0.00040)            (-42,  56)
</pre>

<P>
It may help to multiply one set of values by a constant, so that
they are approximately the same magnitude as the other set.
It may also help to add a constant to one set so that it has
roughly the same origin as the other set.

<P>
One often wants to match objects detected in an image with those
listed in a catalog.  
The detected objects usually have coordinates from the detector,
(row, col) or (x, y), which are really projections of the 
celestial position onto a plane tangent to the celestial
sphere, centered near the middle of the image.
The catalog objects, on the other hand, usually have
coordinates in Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec)
which are in the spherical system.
In order to match the two sets of coordinates, it helps to
project the catalog positions onto a plane, tangent to
the celestial sphere at the center of the image.
The two sets of projected coordinates may then be fairly compared.

<P>
One can find the relationship between spherical coords (RA, Dec)
and their projected equivalents (xi, eta) in any good book
on spherical trigonometry, such as
Smart's <i>Textbook on Spherical Astronomy</i>.
One source for this information on the Web is a paper 
published a few years ago, now available from the 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html">
  Astrophysics Data Systems</a> archive,

See especially the material in section 3.2, on page 204 of the paper.


<P>
The <b>project_coords</b> program converts (RA, Dec) coordinates
into the coordinates on a tangent plane, called (xi, eta) by 
convention.
The input must be an ASCII list of objects, with one line
per object. 
Each line must have columns of data, two of which must be
the RA and Dec in <b>decimal degrees</b> (not sexigesimal HH:MM:SS notation!).
The <b>project_coords</b> program will convert these columns
of the input list, but leave the others as-is.

<P>
Usage is:

<pre>
          project_coords    starfile racol deccol ra dec [asec] [outfile=] 
</pre>
where

<UL>
<LI> <b>starfile</b> is the name of the file containing the 
         ASCII list of objects.  There can be at most 20 columns
         in the file.
<LI> <b>racol</b> is the number of column within the file which
         contains the RA of each object, in decimal degrees
<LI> <b>deccol</b> is the number of column within the file which
         contains the Dec of each object, in decimal degrees
<LI> <b>ra</b> is the Right Ascension of the center of the image
         (in decimal degrees)
         against which the catalog will be matched
<LI> <b>dec</b> is the Declination of the center of the image
         (in decimal degrees)
         against which the catalog will be matched
<LI> <b>asec</b> if this keyword is given, then the (xi, eta)
         coordinates are converted from radians to arcsec before
         being printed to output
<LI> <b>outfile=</b> specifies the name of a file into which to
         write the converted list of data;
         if not present, the converted list is written to stdout
</UL>

<P>
So, for example, given a catalog file <i>gsc.cat</i>, which looks like
this:
<pre>
        GSC_0043_23388    33.87533  -15.22973    13.90  star
        GSC_0043_23390    33.88923  -15.12091    14.30  starlike_object
        GSC_0043_23395    33.90756  -15.33952    12.50  star
</pre>

<P>
and given an image of the sky centered at (RA, Dec) = (33.89, -15.20),
one might run

<pre>
         project_coords  gsc.cat 1 2 33.89 -15.20 outfile=gsc.proj
</pre>

<P>
Looking then at the file <i>gsc.proj</i>, we should find 

<pre>
        GSC_0043_23388 -2.470478e-04 -5.188947e-04 13.90 star
        GSC_0043_23390 -1.297375e-05  1.380382e-03 14.30 starlike_object
        GSC_0043_23395  2.955624e-04 -2.435100e-03 12.50 star
</pre>

<P>
The values in the RA and Dec columns have been replaced by their
xi and eta equivalents projected onto the tangent plane.
Note also that the other columns of information are now separated
by exactly one space, which might be different from the input spacing.

<P>
The (xi, eta) values have units which might be interpreted 
as radians from the tangent point of the projection.
Astronomers might recall that one radian is about 206,265 arcseconds,
and likewise one arcsecond is about 4.85 x 10^(-6) radians.
If the <b>asec</b> option is given, then these values are
converted from radians to arcseconds before being printed.

<P>
After <b>project_coords</b> has converted the coords of a catalog list 
to (xi, eta), one might run the <b>match</b> program on this
converted list, and the list of objects detected in the image.

As mentioned in the section on 
<a href="#project_coords">project_coords</a>, above,
one often projects catalog (RA, Dec) onto a tangent
plane before matching against objects detected in an image.
The <b>match</b> program can be used to find
a good transformation which takes the 
(row, col) coordinates of detected objects into the
(xi, eta) coordinates of catalog objects.
Afterwards, one may wish to 

<OL>
<LI> apply that transformation to the (row, col) coords of detected objects,
         bringing them into the (xi, eta) coords on the tangent plane
<P>
   and then
<P>
<LI> de-project the (xi, eta) coords of detected objects to yield their
         (RA, Dec) values
</OL>

<P>
The <b>apply_match</b> program performs both these steps, 
transforming a list of detected objects with (row, col) coordinates
into a list with (RA, Dec) coordinates.
The input must be an ASCII list of objects, with one line
per object. 
Each line must have columns of data, two of which must be
the position in (x, y) coordinates of the detector.
The <b>apply_match</b> program will convert these columns
of the input list, but leave the others as-is.

<P>
Usage is:

<pre>
          apply_match    starfile xcol ycol ra dec 
                         linear|quadratic|cubic

                         [outfile=]

where

<UL>
<LI> <b>starfile</b> is the name of the file containing the

         in the file.
<LI> <b>xcol</b> is the number of column within the file which
         contains the "x" or "row" position on the detector
<LI> <b>ycol</b> is the number of column within the file which
         contains the "y" or "col" position on the dectector
<LI> <b>ra</b> is the Right Ascension of the center of the image
         (in decimal degrees)
         which serves as the tangent point of the projection
<LI> <b>dec</b> is the Declination of the center of the image
         (in decimal degrees)
         which serves as the tangent point of the projection
<LI> the next argument is a keyword which describes the nature of the
         transformation used by <b>match</b>.
         It must be consistent with the number of coefficients which follow:
         <b>linear</b> implies 6 coefficients, 
         <b>quadratic</b> 12 coefficients,
         and <b>cubic</b> 16 coefficients
<LI> the next bunch of arguments are the coefficients of the transformation
         derived by the <b>match</b> program. 
         There must be either 6 (for linear), 12 (for quadratic),
         or 16 (for cubic)
<LI> <b>outfile=</b> specifies the name of a file into which to
         write the converted list of data;
         if not present, the converted list is written to stdout
</UL>

<P>
So, for example, suppose we have an ASCII file of objects detected
in an image called <i>stars.cat</i>:

<pre>
    1    2.30  585.68   2462  10.63   14.575  0.033 
    2    1.71 1864.68   2462   9.51   15.917  0.108 
    3    3.94 1400.51   2462  10.84   16.024  0.119 
</pre>

where the second and third columns contain the (row, col) positions
of each object. 
We use this as an input to the <b>match</b> program, comparing
it to a subset of a catalog extracted at (RA, Dec) = (33.89, -15.20),
and find the following linear TRANS structure:

<pre>
TRANS: a=0.043661422     b=0.707484673     c=-0.707367056    
       d=0.077633855     e=0.708066513     f=0.706880146 
</pre>

<P>
We can then convert all the (row, col) coords of objects into
(RA, Dec) by running

<pre>
    apply_match  stars.cat 1 2  33.89 -15.20  linear   \
                      0.043661 0.707484 -0.70736 0.077633 0.708066 0.706880
</pre>

<P>
which prints to stdout a list like this:

<pre>
       1  318.81225   43.19368 2462 10.63 14.575 0.033
       2  318.63845   43.05146 2462 9.51 15.917 0.108
       3  318.70546   43.15008 2462 10.84 16.024 0.119
</pre>

<P>
Now the second and third columns contain the transformed
and de-projected coords of the each objects in (RA, Dec).

<P>
Note that the spacing of the columns may be modified: the
program leaves a single space between columns.
