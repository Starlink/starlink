MATCH THANKS file

MATCH was originally written by Michael William Richmond.  Many
    people may someday contribute to MATCH by reporting problems,
    suggesting various improvements or submitting actual code.
    Here is a list of these people. Help me keep it complete and
    exempt of errors.

John Blakeslee       added very useful summary information to the
                         output TRANS structure, added the optional
                         statistics in the MEDTF structure, and 
                         suggested adding "min_scale" and "max_scale".
                     made a second round of suggestions (with code!)
                         for new options: 'identity' and 'intrans='
                     made a third suggestion (with code!)
                         for option "asec" to project_coords program

Andrew Bennett       found several obscure bugs
