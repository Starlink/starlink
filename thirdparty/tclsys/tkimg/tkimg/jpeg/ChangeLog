	* jpeg.c: Removed superfluous function declarations (already done
	  in init.c).

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in: Path to build directory of jpegtcl is required too
	  as include directory, to find 'libjpeg/jconfig.h'.

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in: New configuration variable PHIMTYPE, contains name
	  of image type (in contrast to library name and package
	  name). Inserted in 'init.c'. The configure variable TK_XINCLUDES
	  has to placed in variable, to avoid problem on platforms placing
	  a shell comment into it. More in the Makefile.
