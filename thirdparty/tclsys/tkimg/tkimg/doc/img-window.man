[description]

The package [package img::[vset FORMATNAME]] is a sub-package of
[package Img]. It can be loaded as a part of the complete Img support,
via [cmd {package require Img}], or on its own, via

[cmd "package require img::[vset FORMATNAME]"].

[para]

Like all packages of [package Img] it does [emph not] provide new
commands, but extends the existing [package Tk] command [cmd image].
More specifically

[package img::[vset FORMATNAME]] extends [package Tk]'s [cmd photo]
image type.

[para]

The name of the new format handler is [const [vset FORMATNAME]].

[para]

This handler does not provide additional configuration options.

This handler is special. Instead of reading or writing image data from
a file or string it allows the embedding of a Tk widget into the photo
image. In other words, it takes a snapshot of the contents of a Tk
window.

[para]

All of the above means that in a call like

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd image] [method {create photo}] [opt [arg name]] [opt [arg options]]]
[list_end]

[list_begin enum]
[enum]

Image data in [vset FORMATNAME] format (option [option -data]) is
detected automatically. Image data is considered to be in the

[const [vset FORMATNAME]] format if the value given to option
[option -data] is the name of an existing Tk window.

[nl]

Note that the standard option [option -file] is not supported by this
handler.


[enum]
The format name [const [vset FORMATNAME]] is recognized by the option [option -format].
