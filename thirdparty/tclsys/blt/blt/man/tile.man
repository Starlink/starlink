.SH DESCRIPTION
The tile widgets let you create textured backgrounds.  The texture is
a Tk image which is tiled over the entire background of the widget.
.SH INTRODUCTION
With the advent of Tk 4.0, images are now easy to create and use in
applications.  Images add interest to applications and they convey
more information.  But one area where Tk hasn't taken advantage of
images is using images as textures for widgets.  Since tiling is a
standard feature of X, it's very easy to use images as textures.
.PP
The tile widgets take the standard Tk 4.0 widgets and add tiling
configuration options to them.  Textures are specified by the name 
of the image you wish to be tiled across the background of the widget.  
.SH EXAMPLE
To add tiling to a widget, you simply create an image using 
Tk's \fBimage\fR command and use the image name as the value for
the \fB\-tile\fR configuration option of the widget.
.DS
image create photo my_texture -file tan_paper.gif
tileframe .frame -tile my_texture
.DE
The image \f(CWmy_texture\fR is added to the frame.  
If \f(CWmy_texture\fR is updated, so will the widget background.
.DS
image create photo my_texture -file rain.gif
.DE
An easy way to add tiling to existing programs is to rename
the tile widget commands, overwriting the standard Tk widgets.
.DS
foreach cmd { button checkbutton frame label radiobutton 
	scrollbar } {
    if [info commands tile$cmd] {
	rename $cmd ""
	rename tile$cmd $cmd
    }
}

option add *Tile my_texture

image create photo my_texture -file tan_paper.gif
.DE
You can then set the widget option resource, specifying the tile.  
.SH OPTIONS
The following configurations options are added to the widgets. If
a \fB\-tile\fB or \fB\-activetile\fR option is specified, it overrides
the background color of the widget.
.TP
\fB\-activetile \fIimage\fR 
Specifies a textured background to display when the widget is active.
This option is available for the \fBtilebutton\fR,
\fBtilecheckbutton\fR, \fBtileradiobutton\fR, and \fBtilescrollbar\fR
widgets.  \fIImage\fR is the name an image created using Tk's
\fBimage\fR command.  The background of the widget is tiled with
\fIimage\fR.  If \fIimage\fR is \f(CW""\fR, then the active background
color is displayed.  The default is \f(CW""\fR.
.TP
\fB\-tile \fIimage\fR 
Specifies a textured background to display for the widget.
\fIImage\fR is the name an image created using Tk's \fBimage\fR
command.  The background of the widget is tiled with \fIimage\fR.  If
\fIimage\fR is \f(CW""\fR, then the normal background color is
displayed.  The default is \f(CW""\fR.
