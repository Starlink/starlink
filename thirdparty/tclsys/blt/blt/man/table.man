.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBtable\fR command arranges widgets in a table.  The alignment of
widgets is detemined by their row and column positions and the number
of rows or columns which they span.
.SH INTRODUCTION
Probably the most painstaking aspect of building a graphical
application is getting the placement and size of the widgets just right.
It usually takes many iterations to align widgets and adjust their spacing.
That's because managing the geometry of widgets is simply not a
packing problem, but also graphical design problem.  Attributes
such as alignment, symmetry, and balance are more important than
minimizing the amount of space used for packing.
.PP
The \fBtable\fR geometry manager arranges widgets in a table.  It's
easy to align widgets (horizontally and vertically) or to create empty
space to balance the arrangement of the widgets.  Widgets, called
\fIslaves\fR, are arranged inside of another widget called the
\fImaster\fR.  Slaves are positioned at row,column locations and may
span any number of rows or columns.  More than one widget can occupy a
single location.  
.PP
The placement of slave windows determines both the size and
arrangement of the table.  The table queries the requested size of
each slave.  The \fIrequested size\fR of a widget is the natural size
of the widget (before the widget is shrunk or expanded).  The height
of each row and the width of each column is the largest slave spanning
that row or column.  The size of the table is in turn the sum of the
row and column sizes.  This is the table's \fInormal size\fR.
.PP
The total number of rows and columns in a table is determined from the
indices specified.  The table grows dynamically as windows are added
at larger indices.
.SH EXAMPLE
The table geometry manager is created by invoking the \fBtable\fR command.
.DS
# Create a table in the root window
table .
.DE
The window \f(CW.\fR is now the \fImaster window\fR of the table.
Widgets (\fIslave windows\fR) packed into the table will be
displayed within the confines of the master window.  
.PP
You add widgets to the table by row and column location.  Row and
column indices start from zero.
.DS
label .title -text "This is a title"

# Add a label to the table
table . .title 0,0 
.DE
The label \f(CW.title\fR is added to the table.  We can add more widgets
in the same way.
.DS
button .ok -text "Ok"
button .cancel -text "Cancel"

# Add two buttons
table . .ok 1,0
table . .cancel 1,1
.DE
Two buttons \f(CW.ok\fR and \f(CW.cancel\fR are now packed into the second
row of the table.  They each occupy one cell of the table.  By
default, widgets span only a single row and column.
.PP
The first column contains two widgets, \f(CW.title\fR and \f(CW.ok\fR.  By
default, the widest of the two widgets will define the width of the
column.  However, we want \f(CW.title\fR to be centered horizontally
along the top of the table.  We can make \f(CW.title\fR span two columns
using the \fBconfigure\fR operation.
.DS
# Make the label span both columns
table configure . .title -cspan 2
.DE
The label \f(CW.title\fR will now be centered along the top row of the
table.  
.PP
In the above example, we've create and arranged the layout for the
table invoking the \fBtable\fR command several times.  Alternately, we
could have used a single \fBtable\fR command.
.DS
label .title -text "This is a title"
button .ok -text "Ok"
button .cancel -text "Cancel"

# Create and pack the table
table . \\
    .title  0,0 -cspan 2 \\
    .ok     1,0 \\
    .cancel 1,1
.DE
The table will override the requested width and height of the master
window so that the window fits the table exactly.  This also means
that any change to the size of table will be propagated up through the
Tk window hierarchy.  This feature can be turned off using the
\fBconfigure\fR operation again.
.DS
table configure . -propagate no
.DE
You can also set the width of height of the table to a specific
value. This supersedes the calculated table size.
.DS
# Make the master window 4 inches wide, 3 inches high
table configure . -reqwidth 4i -reqheight 3i
.DE
If a widget is smaller than the cell(s) it occupies, the widget will
float within the extra space.  By default, the widget will be centered
within the space, but you can anchor the widget to any side of cell
using the \fB\-anchor\fR configuration option.
.DS
table configure . .ok -anchor w
.DE
The \fB\-fill\fR option expands the slave widget to fill the 
extra space either vertically or horizontally (or both).
.DS
# Make the title label fill the entire top row
table configure . .title -cspan 2 -fill x 

# Each button will be as height of the 2nd row.
table configure . .ok .cancel -fill y
.DE
The width of \f(CW.title\fR will be the combined widths of both columns.
Both \f(CW.ok\fR and \f(CW.cancel\fR will become as tall as the second row.  
.PP
The \fB\-padx\fR and \fB\-pady\fR options control the amount of padding 
around the slave window.  Both options take a list of one or two values.
.DS
# Pad the title by two pixels above and below.
table configure . .title -pady 2

# Pad each button 2 pixels on the left, and 4 on the right.
table configure . .ok .cancel -padx { 2 4 }
.DE
If the list has only one value, then both exterior sides (top and bottom
or left and right) of the slave window are padded by that amount.  If the
list has two elements, the first specifies padding for the top or left
side and the second for the bottom or right side.
.PP
Like the master window, you can also override the requested widths and
heights of slave windows using the \fB\-reqwidth\fR and
\fB\-reqheight\fR options.  This is especially useful with
character-based widgets (such as buttons, labels, text, listbox, etc)
that let you specify their size only in units of characters and lines,
instead of pixels.
.DS
# Make all buttons one inch wide
table configure . .ok .cancel -reqwidth 1i
.DE
.PP
Each row and column of the table can be configured, again using the
\fBconfigure\fR operation.  Rows are and columns are designated by
\f(CWR\fIi\fR and \f(CWC\fIi\fR respectively, where \fIi\fR is the index
of the row or column.
.PP
For example, you can set the size of a row or column.
.DS
# Make the 1st column 2 inches wide
table configure . c0 -width 2.0i

# Make the 2nd row 1/2 inch high.
table configure . r1 -height 0.5i
.DE
The new size for the row or column overrides its calculated size.  If
no slave windows span the row or column, its height or width is zero.
So you can use the \fB\-width\fR and \fB\-height\fR options to create
empty spaces in the table.
.DS
# Create an empty row and column
table configure . r2 c2 -width 1i
.DE
The \fB\-pady\fR option lets you add padding to the top and bottom
sides of rows.  The \fB\-padx\fR option adds padding to the left and
right sides of columns.  Both options take a list of one or two
values.
.DS
# Pad above the title by two pixels 
table configure . r0 -pady { 2 0 }

# Pad each column 4 pixels on the left, and 2 on the right.
table configure . c* -padx { 2 4 }
.DE
.PP
Notice that you can configure all the rows and columns using either
\f(CWR*\fR or \f(CWC*\fR.
.PP
When the master window is resized, the rows and columns of the table
are also resized.  The \fB\-resize\fR option indicates whether the row
or column can be shrunk or stretched.  If the value is \f(CWshrink\fR,
the row or column can only be resized smaller.  If \f(CWexpand\fR, it
can only be resized larger.  If \f(CWnone\fR, the row or column is
frozen at its normal size.
.DS
# Let the 1st column get smaller, but not bigger
table configure . c0 -resize shrink

# Let the 2nd column get bigger, not smaller
table configure . c1 -resize expand

# Don't resize the first row 
table configure . r0 -resize none
.DE
The following example packs a canvas, two scrollbars, and a title.
The rows and columns containing the scrollbars are frozen at their
normal size, so that even if the frame is resized, the scrollbars will
remain the same width.
.DS
table . \\
    .title   0,0 -cspan 3 \\
    .canvas  1,1 -fill both \\
    .vscroll 1,2 -fill y \\
    .hscroll 2,1 -fill x

# Don't let the scrollbars resize
table configure . c2 r2 -resize none

# Create an empty space to balance the scrollbar
table configure . c0 -width .vscroll
.DE
Note that the value of the \fB\-width\fR option is the name of a slave
window.  This indicates that the width of the column should be the
same as the requested width of \f(CW.vscroll\fR.
.PP
Finally, the \fBforget\fR operation removes slave windows from the table.
.DS
# Remove the windows from the table
table forget .quit .frame
.DE
It's not necessary to specify the master window.  The \fBtable\fR
command determines the master window from the slave window name.
.SH OPERATIONS
The following operations are available for the \fBtable\fR:
.TP
\fBtable \fImaster\fR ?\fIslave index option value\fR?...  
Adds the widget \fIslave\fR to the table at \fIindex\fR.  \fIIndex\fR
is a row,column position in the table.  It must be in the form
\fIrow\fR,\fIcolumn\fR where \fIrow\fR and \fIcolumn\fR are the
respective row and column numbers, starting from zero (0,0 is the
upper leftmost position).  \fIRow\fR and \fIcolumn\fR may also be
numeric expressions which are recursively evaluated.  If a table
doesn't exist for \fImaster\fR, one is created.  \fISlave\fR is the
path name of the window, which must already exist, to be arranged
inside of \fImaster\fR. \fIOption\fR and \fIvalue\fR are described
in the 
.SB SLAVE OPTIONS
section.
.TP
\fBtable arrange\fR \fImaster\fR
Forces the table to compute its layout immediately.  Normally, the
table geometry manager will wait until the next idle point, before
calculating the size of its rows and columns.  This is useful for
collecting the \fInormal\fR sizes of rows and columns, which are
based upon the requested slave window sizes.
.TP
\fBtable cget\fR \fImaster \fR?\fIitem\fR?\fI option\fR
Returns the current value of the configuration option specific to
\fIitem\fR given by \fIoption\fR.  \fIItem\fR is either a row or
column index, or the path name of a slave window.  \fIItem\fR can be
in any form describe in the \fBconfigure\fR operation below. If no
\fIitem\fR argument is provided, then the configuration option is
for the table itself.  \fIOption\fR may be any one of the options
described in the appropiate section for \fIitem\fR.
.TP
\fBtable configure\fR \fImaster item\fR... ?\fIoption value\fR?... 
Queries or modifies the configuration options specific to \fIitem\fR.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, this command returns a list
describing all of the available options for \fIitem\fR 
If the argument \fIitem\fR is omitted, then the specified 
configuration options are for the table itself.  Otherwise
\fIitem\fR must be either a row or column specification, or the path
name of a slave window.  
The following \fIitem\fR types are available.
.RS
.TP 
\f(CWC\fIi\fR
Specifies the column of \fImaster\fR to be configured.  \fIItem\fR
must be in the form \f(CWC\fIn\fR, where \fIi\fR is the index of 
the column.  See the

section.
.TP
\f(CWR\fIi\fR
Specifies the row of \fImaster\fR to be configured. \fIItem\fR must be
in the form \f(CWR\fIi\fR, where \fIi\fR is the index of the row.  See
the
.SB ROW OPTIONS
section.
.TP 
\fIslave\fR 
Specifies a slave window of \fImaster\fR to be queried.  \fISlave\fR
is the path name of a slave window packed in \fImaster\fR.  See the
.SB SLAVE OPTIONS
section.
.TP 
No argument
Specifies that the table itself is to be queried.  
See the
.SB TABLE OPTIONS
section for a description of the option-value pairs for the table.
.RE
.RS
.sp
The \fIoption\fI and \fIvalue\fR pairs are specific to \fIitem\fR.  If
\fIoption\fR is specified with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command
returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be
identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
\fIoption\fR is specified).  If one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs
are specified, then the command modifies the given option(s) to have
the given value(s); in this case the command returns the empty string.
.RE
.TP
\fBtable extents \fImaster\fR \fIindex\fR 
Queries the location and dimensions of row and columns in the table.
\fIIndex\fR can be either a row or column index or a table index.
Returns a list of the x,y coordinates (upperleft corner) and
dimensions (width and height) of the cell, row, or column.
.TP
\fBtable forget \fIslave\fR ?\fIslave\fR?...
Requests that \fIslave\fR no longer have its geometry managed.
\fISlave\fR is the pathname of the window currently 
managed by some table. The window will be unmapped so that it no longer 
appears on the screen.  If \fIslave\fR is not currently managed by any table, 
an error message is returned, otherwise the empty string.
.TP
\fBtable info \fImaster\fR \fIitem\fR 
Returns a list of the current configuration options for \fIitem\fR.  
The list returned is exactly in the form that might be specified to the

.DE
The following options are available for the table:
.RS
.TP
\fB\-columns \fInumber\fR
Sets the number of columns in the table.  By default, the table
creates new columns whenever they are needed.  If the number of 
columns is less than currently in \fImaster\fR, any slave windows
located in those columns are removed from the table.
.TP 
\fB\-padx \fIpad\fR
Sets how much padding to add to the left and right exteriors of the table.
\fIPad\fR can be a list of one or two numbers.  If \fIpad\fR
has two elements, the left side of the table is padded by the first
value and the right side by the second value.  If \fIpad\fR has just
one value, both the left and right sides are padded evenly by the
value.  The default is \f(CW0\fR.
.TP
\fB\-pady \fIpad\fR
Sets how much padding to add to the top and bottom exteriors of the table.
\fIPad\fR can be a list of one or two numbers.  If
\fIpad\fR has two elements, the area above the table is padded by
the first value and the area below by the second value.  If \fIpad\fR
is just one number, both the top and bottom areas are padded by the

are available for slave windows:
.RS
.TP
\fB\-anchor \fIanchor\fR 
Anchors \fIslave\fR to a particular edge of the cell(s) it resides.
This option has effect only if the space of the spans surrounding
\fIslave\fR is larger than \fIslave\fR. \fIAnchor\fR specifies
how \fIslave\fR will be positioned in the space.  For example, if
\fIanchor\fR is \f(CWcenter\fR then the window is centered in the rows
and columns it spans; if \fIanchor\fR is \f(CWw\fR then the window will
be aligned with the leftmost edge of the span. The default is
\f(CWcenter\fR.
.TP
\fB\-columnspan \fInumber\fR
Sets the number of columns \fIslave\fR will span.
The default is \f(CW1\fR.
.TP
\fB\-columnweight \fIweight\fR
Specifies how much weight the width \fIslave\fR should have when 
the table computes the sizes of the columns it spans. \fIWeight\fR is 
either \f(CWnormal\fR, \f(CWnone\fR, or \f(CWfull\fR.  For example, if 
\fIweight\fR is \f(CWnone\fR, then the width of \fIslave\fR will not 
affect the widths of the columns in which it spans.   If \fIweight\fR is 
\f(CWfull\fR, only the width of \fIslave\fR be considered when computing the
widths of the columns. \f(CWNormal\fR indicates that the widest slave
spanning the column will determine the width of the span.
The default is \f(CWnormal\fR.
.TP
\fB\-fill \fIfill\fR
If the space in the span surrounding \fIslave\fR is larger than
\fIslave\fR, then \fIfill\fR indicates if \fIslave\fR should be
stretched to occupy the extra space.  \fIFill\fR is either \f(CWnone\fR,
\f(CWx\fR, \f(CWy\fR, \f(CWboth\fR.  For example, if \fIfill\fR is \f(CWx\fR,
then \fIslave\fR is stretched horizontally.  If \fIfill\fR is \f(CWy\fR,
\fIslave\fR is stretched vertically.  The default is \f(CWnone\fR.
.TP
\fB\-ipadx \fIpixels\fR 
Sets how much horizontal padding to add internally on the left and
right sides of \fIslave\fR.  \fIPixels\fR must be a valid screen distance

value.  The default is \f(CW0\fR.
.TP
\fB\-reqheight \fIheight\fR
Specifies the limits of the requested height for \fIslave\fR.
\fIHeight\fR is a list of bounding values.  See the 
.SB BOUNDING SIZES
section for a description of this list.  By default, the height of
\fIslave\fR is its requested height with its internal padding
(see the \fB\-ipady\fR option).  The bounds specified by \fIheight\fR
either override the height completely, or bound the height between two sizes.
The default is \f(CW""\fR.
.TP
\fB\-reqwidth \fIwidth\fR
Specifies the limits of the requested width for \fIslave\fR.
\fIWidth\fR is a list of bounding values.  See the

Sets the padding to the left and right of the column.
\fIPad\fR can be a list of one or two numbers.  If \fIpad\fR has two
elements, the left side of the column is padded by the first value and
the right side by the second value.  If \fIpad\fR has just one value,
both the left and right sides are padded evenly by the value.  The
default is \f(CW0\fR.
.TP
\fB\-resize \fImode\fR
Indicates that the column can expand or shrink from its normal width 
when the table is resized.
\fIMode\fR must be one of the following:
\f(CWnone\fR, \f(CWexpand\fR, \f(CWshrink\fR, or \f(CWboth\fR.  If \fImode\fR is 
\f(CWexpand\fR the width of the column is expanded if there is extra space
in the master window. If \fImode\fR is \f(CWshrink\fR its width may be
reduced beyond its normal width if there is not enough space in the master.
The default is \f(CWnone\fR.
.TP
\fB\-width \fIwidth\fR
Specifies the limits within which the width of the column may expand
or shrink.  \fIWidth\fR is a list of bounding values.  See the section
.SB BOUNDING SIZES
for a description of this list.
By default there are no constraints.
.RE
.SH ROW OPTIONS
To configure a row in the table, specify the row index as \f(CWR\fIi\fR,
where \fIi\fR is the index of the row to be configured.
.DS
\fBtable configure\fR \fImaster \f(CWR\fIi\fR ?\fIoption value\fR?...
.DE
If the index is specified as \f(CWR*\fR, then all rows of the table will
be configured.  The following options are available for table rows.
.RS
.TP
\fB\-height \fIheight\fR
Specifies the limits of the height which the row may expand or shrink to. 
\fIHeight\fR is a list of bounding values.  See the section 
.SB BOUNDING SIZES
for a description of this list.
By default there are no constraints.
.TP
\fB\-pady \fIpad\fR
Sets the padding above and below the row.  \fIPad\fR can be a list
of one or two numbers.  If \fIpad\fR has two elements, the area above
the row is padded by the first value and the area below by the
second value.  If \fIpad\fR is just one number, both the top and
bottom areas are padded by the value.  The default is \f(CW0\fR.
.TP
\fB\-resize \fImode\fR
Indicates that the row can expand or shrink from its normal height 
when the table is resized.
\fIMode\fR must be one of the following:
\f(CWnone\fR, \f(CWexpand\fR, \f(CWshrink\fR, or \f(CWboth\fR.  If \fImode\fR is 
\f(CWexpand\fR the height of the row is expanded if there is extra space
in the master window. If \fImode\fR is \f(CWshrink\fR its height may be
reduced beyond its normal height if there is not enough space in the master.
The default is \f(CWnone\fR.
.RE
.SH BOUNDING SIZES
Sometimes it's more useful to limit resizes to an acceptable range,
than to fix the size to a particular value or disallow resizing
altogether.  Similar to the way the \fBwm\fR command lets you specify
a \fBminsize\fR and \fBmaxsize\fR for a toplevel window, you can bound
the sizes the master window, a slave window, row, or column may take.
The \fB\-width\fR, \fB\-height\fR, \fB\-reqwidth\fR, and
\fB\-reqheight\fR options, take a list of one, two, or three values.
We can take a previous example and instead preventing resizing,
bound the size of the scrollbars between two values.
.DS
table . \\
    .title   0,0 -cspan 3 \\
    .canvas  1,1 -fill both \\
    .vscroll 1,2 -fill y \\
    .hscroll 2,1 -fill x

# Bound the scrollbars between 1/8 and 1/2 inch
table configure . c2 -width { 0.125 0.5 }
table configure . r2 -height { 0.125 0.5 }
table configure . vscroll .hscroll -fill both
.DE
The scrollbars will get no smaller than 1/8 of an inch, or bigger
than 1/2 inch.  The initial size will be their requested size,
so long as it is within the specified bounds.
.PP
How the elements of the list are interpreted is dependent upon the
number of elements in the list.  
.RS
.TP 1i
{\fI\fR}
Empty list. No bounds are set. The default sizing is performed.
.TP 
{\fI x \fR} 
Fixes the size to \fIx\fR.  The window or partition cannot grow or
shrink.
.TP 
{\fI min max \fR}
Sets up minimum and maximum limits for the size of the window or
partition.  The window or partition can be reduced less than
\fImin\fR, nor can it be stretched beyond \fImax\fR.
.TP 
{\fI min max nom \fR}
Specifies minimum and maximum size limits, but also specifies a
nominal size \fInom\fR.  This overrides the calculated size of the
window or partition.
.RE
.SH MISCELLANEOUS
Another feature is that you can put two slave windows in the
same cell of the table.  This is useful when you want to add
decorations around a widget.
.DS
frame .frame -bd 1 -relief sunken
button .quit -text "Quit"

# Put both the frame and the button in the same cell.
table . \\
    .quit  1,0 -padx 2 -pady 2 \\
    .frame 1,0 -fill both
.DE
.SH LIMITATIONS
In Tk version 3, errors may occur if slave windows are add or taken
from the table by another geometry manager.  This has been fixed in
Tk 4.0.
.PP
There is no way to detect if a window is already a master of a
different geometry manager.  Bizarre window re-positioning may occur,
as each geometry manager applies its own brand of layout policies.
If the window is a top level window, the window manager may become
involved, responding to the each new size request and your session 
may hang.
