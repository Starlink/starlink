# ::fileutil::find ==
#
# Two different implementations of this command, one for Unix with its
# softlinks, the other for the Win* platform. The trouble with
# softlink is that they can generate circles in the directory and/or
# file structure, leading a simple recursion into infinity. So we
# record device/inode information for each file and directory we touch
# to be able to skip it should we happen to visit it again.

# Note about the general implementation: The tcl interpreter sets a
# tcl stack limit of 1000 levels to prevent infinite recursions from
# running out of bounds. As this command is implemented recursively it
# will fail for very deeply nested directory structures.
