NAME
       tk_dialog - Create modal dialog and wait for response

SYNOPSIS
       tk_dialog  window  title text bitmap default string string
       ...


DESCRIPTION
       This procedure is part of  the  Tk  script  library.   Its
       arguments describe a dialog box:

       window Name  of  top-level  window to use for dialog.  Any
              existing window by this name is destroyed.

       title  Text to appear in the window  manager's  title  bar
              for the dialog.

       text   Message  to appear in the top portion of the dialog
              box.

       bitmap If non-empty, specifies a bitmap to display in  the
              top portion of the dialog, to the left of the text.
              If this is an empty string then no bitmap  is  dis-
              played in the dialog.

       default
              If  this  is  an  integer  greater than or equal to
              zero, then it gives the index of the button that is
              to  be the default button for the dialog (0 for the
              leftmost button, and so on).  If less than zero  or
              an  empty  string  then  there won't be any default
              button.

       string There will be one button for each  of  these  argu-
              ments.   Each string specifies text to display in a
              button, in order from left to right.

       After creating a dialog box, tk_dialog waits for the  user
       to  select  one  of  the buttons either by clicking on the
       button with the mouse or by typing return  to  invoke  the
       default button (if any).  Then it returns the index of the
       selected button:  0 for the leftmost  button,  1  for  the
       button  next  to it, and so on.  If the dialog's window is
       destroyed before the user selects one of the buttons, then
       -1 is returned.

       While  waiting  for  the user to respond, tk_dialog sets a
       local grab.  This prevents the user from interacting  with
       the  application  in  any  way except to invoke the dialog
       box.
