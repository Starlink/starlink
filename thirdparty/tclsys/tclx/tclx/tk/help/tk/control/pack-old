DESCRIPTION
       Note:  this manual entry describes the syntax for the pack
       command as it existed before  Tk  version  3.3.   Although
       this syntax continues to be supported for backward compat-
       ibility, it is obsolete and should not  be  used  anymore.
       At  some point in the future it may cease to be supported.

       The packer is a geometry manager that arranges  the  chil-
       dren of a parent by packing them in order around the edges
       of the parent.  The first child is placed against one side
       of  the  window,  occupying  the entire span of the window
       along that side.  This reduces  the  space  remaining  for
       other  children  as  if  the side had been moved in by the
       size of the first child.  Then the next  child  is  placed
       against  one side of the remaining cavity, and so on until
       all children have been placed or there is no space left in
       the cavity.

       The  before,  after,  and append forms of the pack command
       are used to insert one or more children into  the  packing
       order for their parent.  The before form inserts the chil-
       dren before window sibling in the order;  all of the other
       windows  must  be  siblings  of  sibling.   The after form
       inserts the windows after sibling,  and  the  append  form
       appends  one  or  more  windows  to the end of the packing
       order for parent.  If a window named in any of these  com-
       mands  is already packed in its parent, it is removed from
       its current position in the packing order and repositioned
       as indicated by the command.  All of these commands return
       an empty string as result.

       The unpack form of the pack command  removes  window  from
       the  packing order of its parent and unmaps it.  After the
       execution of this command the packer will no longer manage
       window's geometry.

       The  placement  of each child is actually a four-step pro-
       cess; the options argument following each window  consists
       of  a list of one or more fields that govern the placement
       of that window.  In the discussion below, the term  cavity
       refers  to  the  space  left in a parent when a particular
       child is placed (i.e. all the space that wasn't claimed by
       earlier  children  in the packing order).  The term parcel
       refers to the space allocated to a particular child;  this
       is  not  necessarily  the same as the child window's final
       geometry.

       The first step in placing a child is  to  determine  which
       side  of  the  cavity it will lie against.  Any one of the
       following options may be used to specify a side:

       top    Position the child's parcel against the top of  the
              cavity, occupying the full width of the cavity.

       bottom Position  the  child's parcel against the bottom of
              the cavity, occupying the full width of the cavity.

       left   Position  the  child's parcel against the left side
              of the cavity, occupying the  full  height  of  the
              cavity.

       right  Position  the child's parcel against the right side
              of the cavity, occupying the  full  height  of  the
              cavity.

       At  most  one of these options should be specified for any
       given window.  If no side is specified, then  the  default
       is top.

       The  second  step  is to decide on a parcel for the child.
       For top and bottom windows, the desired  parcel  width  is
       normally the cavity width and the desired parcel height is
       the window's requested height, as passed to Tk_GeometryRe-
       quest.  For  left  and  right  windows, the desired parcel
       height is normally the cavity height and the desired width
       is the window's requested width.  However, extra space may
       be requested for the window using  any  of  the  following
       options:

       padx num    Add num pixels to the window's requested width
                   before computing the parcel size as  described
                   above.

       pady num    Add  num  pixels  to  the  window's  requested
                   height before computing  the  parcel  size  as
                   described above.

       expand      This  option requests that the window's parcel
                   absorb any extra space left over in  the  par-
                   ent's  cavity  after packing all the children.
                   The amount of space left over depends  on  the
                   sizes requested by the other children, and may
                   be zero.  If several windows have  all  speci-
                   fied  expand  then  the  extra  width  will be
                   divided equally among all the left  and  right
                   windows  that  specified  expand and the extra
                   height will be divided equally among  all  the
                   top  and bottom windows that specified expand.

       If the desired width or height for a parcel is larger than
       the  corresponding  dimension of the cavity, then the cav-
       ity's dimension is used instead.

       The third step in placing the window is to decide  on  the
       window's  width and height.  The default is for the window
       to receive either its requested width and  height  or  the
       those  of the parcel, whichever is smaller.  If the parcel
       is larger than the window's requested size, then the  fol-
       lowing  options  may  be used to expand the window to par-
       tially or completely fill the parcel:

       fill   Set the window's size to equal the parcel size.

       fillx  Increase the window's width to equal  the  parcel's
              width, but retain the window's requested height.

       filly  Increase  the window's height to equal the parcel's
              height, but retain the window's requested width.

       The last step is to decide the  window's  location  within
       its  parcel.   If  the  window's  size equals the parcel's
       size, then the window simply fills the entire parcel.   If
       the parcel is larger than the window, then one of the fol-
       lowing options may be used to  specify  where  the  window
       should be positioned within its parcel:

       frame center   Center  the  window in its parcel.  This is
                      the default if no framing option is  speci-
                      fied.

       frame n        Position  the window with its top edge cen-
                      tered on the top edge of the parcel.

       frame ne       Position the window  with  its  upper-right
                      corner  at  the  upper-right  corner of the
                      parcel.

       frame e        Position the window  with  its  right  edge
                      centered on the right edge of the parcel.

       frame se       Position  the  window  with its lower-right
                      corner at the  lower-right  corner  of  the
                      parcel.

       frame s        Position  the  window  with its bottom edge
                      centered on the bottom edge of the  parcel.

       frame sw       Position  the  window  with  its lower-left
                      corner at  the  lower-left  corner  of  the
                      parcel.

       frame w        Position the window with its left edge cen-
                      tered on the left edge of the parcel.

       frame nw       Position the  window  with  its  upper-left
                      corner at the upper-left corner of the par-
                      cel.

       The packer manages the mapped/unmapped state  of  all  the
       packed  children  windows.  It automatically maps the win-
       dows when it packs them, and it  unmaps  any  windows  for
       which there was no space left in the cavity.

       The packer makes geometry requests on behalf of the parent
       windows it manages.  For each parent window it requests  a
       size large enough to accommodate all the options specified
       by all the packed children, such that zero space would  be
       leftover for expand options.
