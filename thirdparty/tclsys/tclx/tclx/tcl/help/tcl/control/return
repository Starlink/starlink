NAME
       return - Return from a procedure

SYNOPSIS
       return  ?-code  code?  ?-errorinfo info? ?-errorcode code?
       ?string?


DESCRIPTION
       Return immediately from the  current  procedure  (or  top-
       level  command  or  source  command),  with  string as the
       return value.  If string is not specified  then  an  empty
       string will be returned as result.


EXCEPTIONAL RETURNS
       In  the  usual case where the -code option isn't specified
       the procedure will return normally  (its  completion  code
       will be TCL_OK).  However, the -code option may be used to
       generate an exceptional return from the  procedure.   Code
       may have any of the following values:

       ok        Normal  return:   same as if the option is omit-
                 ted.

       error     Error return: same as if the error command  were
                 used to terminate the procedure, except for han-
                 dling of errorInfo and errorCode variables  (see
                 below).

       return    The current procedure will return with a comple-
                 tion code of TCL_RETURN, so that  the  procedure
                 that invoked it will return also.

       break     The current procedure will return with a comple-
                 tion code of TCL_BREAK, which will terminate the
                 innermost  nested  loop in the code that invoked
                 the current procedure.

       continue  The current procedure will return with a comple-
                 tion  code of TCL_CONTINUE, which will terminate
                 the current iteration of  the  innermost  nested
                 loop in the code that invoked the current proce-
                 dure.

       value     Value must be an integer;  it will  be  returned
                 as  the  completion  code for the current proce-
                 dure.

       The -code option is rarely used.  It is provided  so  that
       procedures  that  implement  new  control  structures  can
       reflect exceptional conditions back to their callers.

       Two additional options, -errorinfo and -errorcode, may  be
       used   to  provide  additional  information  during  error
       returns.  These options are ignored unless code is  error.

       The -errorinfo option specifies an initial stack trace for
       the errorInfo variable;  if it is not specified  then  the
       stack trace left in errorInfo will include the call to the
       procedure and higher levels on the stack but it  will  not
       include  any  information  about  the context of the error
       within the procedure.  Typically the info  value  is  sup-
       plied  from the value left in errorInfo after a catch com-
       mand trapped an error within the procedure.

       If the -errorcode option is specified then code provides a
       value  for  the  errorCode variable.  If the option is not
       specified then errorCode will default to NONE.
