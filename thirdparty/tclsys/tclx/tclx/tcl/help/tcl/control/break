NAME
       break - Abort looping command

SYNOPSIS
       break


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  is  typically  invoked inside the body of a
       looping command such as  for  or  foreach  or  while.   It
       returns  a  TCL_BREAK code, which causes a break exception
       to occur.  The exception causes the current script  to  be
       aborted  out  to  the  innermost  containing loop command,
       which then aborts  its  execution  and  returns  normally.
       Break  exceptions  are  also handled in a few other situa-
       tions, such as the catch command, Tk event  bindings,  and
       the outermost scripts of procedure bodies.
