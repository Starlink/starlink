       try_eval code catch ?finally?

              The  try_eval command evaluates code in the current
              context.

       If an error occurs during the evaluation and catch is  not
       empty,  then catch is evaluated to handler the error.  The
       result of the command, containing the error message,  will
       be  stored  in  a global variable errorResult.  The global
       variables errorResult, errorInfo  and  errorCode  will  be
       imported  into the current scope, there is no need to exe-
       cute a global command.  The result of  the  catch  command
       becomes  the result of the try_eval command.  If the error
       that caused the catch to be evaluate is to  be  continued,
       the following command should be used:
            error $errorResult $errorCode $errorInfo

       If  the  finally argument is supplied and not empty, it is
       evaluated after the evaluation of the code and  the  catch
       commands.  If an error occurs during the evaluation of the
       finally command, it becomes the  result  of  the  try_eval
       command.   Otherwise,  the result of either code  or catch
       is preserved, as described above.

       This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
