NAME
       catch - Evaluate script and trap exceptional returns

SYNOPSIS
       catch script ?varName?


DESCRIPTION
       The  catch  command  may  be  used  to prevent errors from
       aborting command  interpretation.   Catch  calls  the  Tcl
       interpreter  recursively  to  execute  script,  and always
       returns a TCL_OK code, regardless of any errors that might
       occur while executing script.  The return value from catch
       is a decimal string giving the code returned  by  the  Tcl
       interpreter  after  executing  script.   This  will  be  0
       (TCL_OK) if there were no errors in script;  otherwise  it
       will  have  a  non-zero  value corresponding to one of the
       exceptional return codes (see tcl.h for the definitions of
       code  values).   If the varName argument is given, then it
       gives the name of a variable; catch will set the  variable
       to  the string returned from script (either a result or an
       error message).

       Note that catch catches all  exceptions,  including  those
       generated by break and continue as well as errors.
