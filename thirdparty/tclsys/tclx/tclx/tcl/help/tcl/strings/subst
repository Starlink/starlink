NAME
       subst - Perform backslash, command, and variable substitu-
       tions

SYNOPSIS
       subst ?-nobackslashes? ?-nocommands? ?-novariables? string


DESCRIPTION
       This command performs variable substitutions, command sub-
       stitutions, and  backslash  substitutions  on  its  string
       argument  and  returns  the fully-substituted result.  The
       substitutions are performed in exactly the same way as for
       Tcl  commands.   As a result, the string argument is actu-
       ally substituted twice, once by  the  Tcl  parser  in  the
       usual  fashion  for  Tcl  commands, and again by the subst
       command.

       If any of the -nobackslashes, -nocommands, or -novariables
       are  specified,  then  the corresponding substitutions are
       not performed.  For example, if -nocommands is  specified,
       no  command  substitution  is  performed:   open and close
       brackets are treated as ordinary characters with  no  spe-
       cial interpretation.

       Note:  when  it performs its substitutions, subst does not
       give any special  treatment  to  double  quotes  or  curly
       braces.  For example, the script
              set a 44
              subst {xyz {$a}}
       returns ``xyz {44}'', not ``xyz {$a}''.
