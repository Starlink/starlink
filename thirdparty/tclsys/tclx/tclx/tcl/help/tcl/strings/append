NAME
       append - Append to variable

SYNOPSIS
       append varName ?value value value ...?


DESCRIPTION
       Append  all of the value arguments to the current value of
       variable varName.  If varName doesn't exist, it is given a
       value  equal  to  the concatenation of all the value argu-
       ments.  This command provides an efficient way to build up
       long  variables  incrementally.   For  example, ``append a
       $b'' is much more efficient than ``set a $a$b'' if  $a  is
       long.
