       lassign list var ?var...?
              Assign  successive  elements of a list to specified
              variables.  If there are more variable  names  than
              fields,  the  remaining  variables  are  set to the
              empty string.  If  there  are  more  elements  than
              variables,  a  list  of  the unassigned elements is
              returned.

              For example,

                  lassign {dave 100 200 {Dave Foo}} name uid gid longName

              Assigns name to ``dave'', uid to  ``100'',  gid  to
              ``200'', and longName to ``Dave Foo''.
