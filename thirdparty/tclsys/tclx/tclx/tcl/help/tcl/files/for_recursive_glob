       for_recursive_glob var dirlist globlist code
              This  procedure  performs a foreach-style loop over
              recursively  matched  files.   All  directories  in
              dirlist  are  recursively searched (breadth-first),
              comparing each file found  against  the  file  glob
              patterns  in  globlist.  For each matched file, the
              variable var is set to the file path  and  code  is
              evaluated.  Symbolic links are not followed.

              This procedure is provided by Extended Tcl.
