NAME
       fblocked - Test whether the last input operation exhausted
       all available input

SYNOPSIS
       fblocked channelId


DESCRIPTION
       The fblocked command returns 1 if the  most  recent  input
       operation  on  channelId  returned  less  information than
       requested because all available input was exhausted.   For
       example,  if  gets  is  invoked  when there are only three
       characters  available  for  input   and   no   end-of-line
       sequence,  gets  returns  an empty string and a subsequent
       call to fblocked will return 1.
