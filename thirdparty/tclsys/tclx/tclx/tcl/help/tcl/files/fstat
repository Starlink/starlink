       fstat fileId ?item? | ?stat arrayvar?

              Obtain status information about an open file.

              The following keys are used to identify data items:

              atime  The time of last access.

              ctime  The time of last file status change

              dev    The device containing a  directory  for  the
                     file.   This  value  uniquely identifies the
                     file system that contains the file.

              gid    The group ID of the file's group.

              ino    The inode number.  This field uniquely iden-
                     tifies the file in a given file system.

              mode   The  mode  of the file (see the mknod system
                     call).

              mtime  Time when the data in the file was last mod-
                     ified.

              nlink  The number of links to the file.

              size   The file size in bytes.

              tty    If  the  file is associated with a terminal,
                     then 1 otherwise 0.

              type   The type of the file in symbolic form, which
                     is one of the following values: file, direc-
                     tory, characterSpecial, blockSpecial,  fifo,
                     link, or socket.

              uid    The user ID of the file's owner.

              If  one  of  these  keys is specified as item, then
              that data item is returned.

              If stat arrayvar is specified, then the information
              is  returned  in  the  array arrayvar.  Each of the
              above keys indexes an element of the array contain-
              ing the data.

              If  only  fileId  is specified, the command returns
              the data as a keyed list.

              The  following  values  may  be  returned  only  if
              explicitly  asked for, it will not be returned with
              the array or keyed list forms:
              remotehost
                     If fileId is  a  TCP/IP  socket  connection,
                     then  a list is returned with the first ele-
                     ment being the remote host IP  address.   If
                     the  remote  host  name  can be found, it is
                     returned as the second element of the  list.
                     The  remote host IP port number is the third
                     element.

              localhost
                     If fileId is  a  TCP/IP  socket  connection,
                     then  a list is returned with the first ele-
                     ment being the local host  IP  address.   If
                     the  local  host  name  can  be found, it is
                     returned as the second element of the  list.
                     The  local  host IP port number is the third
                     element.
