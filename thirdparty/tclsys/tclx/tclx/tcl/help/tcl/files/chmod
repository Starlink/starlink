       chmod [-fileid] mode filelist
              Set  permissions  of  each of the files in the list
              filelist to mode, where mode is an absolute numeric
              mode   or  symbolic  permissions  as  in  the  UNIX
              chmod(1) command.  To specify a mode as  octal,  it
              should be prefixed with a "0" (e.g. 0622).

              If  the  option -fileid is specified, filelist is a
              list of open file identifiers rather than a list of
              file  names.   This  option is not available on all
              Unix systems.  Use the infox have_fchmod command to
              determine if this functionality is available.

              The  chmod  command  is  not  available  on Windows
              95/NT.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
