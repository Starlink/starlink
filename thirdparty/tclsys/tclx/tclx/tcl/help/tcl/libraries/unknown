NAME
       unknown - Handle attempts to use non-existent commands

SYNOPSIS
       unknown cmdName ?arg arg ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  command is invoked by the Tcl interpreter whenever a
       script tries to invoke a command that doesn't exist.   The
       implementation  of  unknown  isn't  part  of the Tcl core;
       instead, it is a library procedure defined by default when
       Tcl  starts  up.   You can override the default unknown to
       change its functionality.

       If the Tcl interpreter encounters a command name for which
       there  is  not  a defined command, then Tcl checks for the
       existence of a command named unknown.  If there is no such
       command,  then  the  interpreter returns an error.  If the
       unknown command exists, then it is invoked with  arguments
       consisting of the fully-substituted name and arguments for
       the original non-existent command.   The  unknown  command
       typically  does  things  like  searching  through  library
       directories for a command procedure with the name cmdName,
       or  expanding abbreviated command names to full-length, or
       automatically executing unknown commands as sub-processes.
       In  some  cases  (such as expanding abbreviations) unknown
       will  change  the  original  command  slightly  and   then
       (re-)execute  it.   The  result  of the unknown command is
       used as the result for the original non-existent  command.

       The  default implementation of unknown behaves as follows.
       It first calls the auto_load library procedure to load the
       command.   If this succeeds, then it executes the original
       command with its original  arguments.   If  the  auto-load
       fails then unknown calls auto_execok to see if there is an
       executable file by the name cmd.  If so,  it  invokes  the
       Tcl  exec  command with cmd and all the args as arguments.
       If cmd can't be auto-executed, unknown checks  to  see  if
       the  command  was  invoked at top-level and outside of any
       script.  If so, then unknown takes two  additional  steps.
       First,  it  sees  if  cmd  has  one of the following three
       forms: !!, !event, or ^old^new?^?.  If  so,  then  unknown
       carries  out history substitution in the same way that csh
       would for these constructs.  Finally,  unknown  checks  to
       see  if  cmd  is a unique abbreviation for an existing Tcl
       command.  If so, it expands the command name and  executes
       the  command  with the original arguments.  If none of the
       above efforts  has  been  able  to  execute  the  command,
       unknown generates an error return.  If the global variable
       auto_noload  is  defined,  then  the  auto-load  step   is
       skipped.   If  the  global variable auto_noexec is defined
       then the auto-exec step is skipped.  Under normal  circum-
       stances  the return value from unknown is the return value
       from the command that was eventually executed.
