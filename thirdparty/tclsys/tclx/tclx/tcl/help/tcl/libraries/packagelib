TCL LOADABLE LIBRARIES AND PACKAGES
       Extended  Tcl supports standard Tcl tclIndex libraries and
       package libraries. A package library file can contain mul-
       tiple independent Tcl packages.  A package is a named col-
       lection of related Tcl procedures and initialization code.

       The package library file is just a regular Unix text file,
       editable with your favorite text editor, containing  pack-
       ages  of  Tcl  source  code. The package library file name
       must have the suffix .tlib.  An index file with  the  same
       prefix  name  and the suffix .tndx resides the same direc-
       tory as the .tlib file.  The .tndx will  be  automatically
       created  whenever  it  is out of date or missing (provided
       there is write access to the directory).

       The variable auto_path contains a list of directories that
       are  searched  for  libraries.   The first time an unknown
       command trap is take, the indexes for  the  libraries  are
       loaded  into  memory. If the auto_path variable is changed
       during execution of a program,  it  will  be  re-searched.
       Only  the  first  package of a given name found during the
       execution of a program is loaded.  This can be  overridden
       with loadlibindex command.

       The start of a package is delimited by:

              #@package: package_name proc1 ?..procN?

       These  lines must start in column one.  Everything between
       the #@package: keyword and the next #@package: keyword  or
       a  #@packend keyword, or the end of the file, becomes part
       of  the  named   package.    The   specified   procedures,
       proc1..procN, are the entry points of the package.  When a
       command named in a package specification is  executed  and
       detected  as an unknown command, all code in the specified
       package will be sourced.  This package should  define  all
       of  the  procedures  named on the package line, define any
       support procedures required by  the  package  and  do  any
       package-specific  initialization.   Packages  declarations
       maybe continued on subsequent  lines  using  standard  Tcl
       backslash  line  continuations.   The #@packend keyword is
       useful to make sure only the minimum required  section  of
       code  is  sourced.  Thus for example a large comment block
       at the beginning of the next file won't be loaded.

       Care should be taken  in  defining  package_name,  as  the
       first  package  found  in the path by with a given name is
       loaded.  This can be useful in developing new  version  of
       packages installed on the system.

       For example, in a package source file, the presence of the
       following line:

              #@package: directory_stack pushd popd dirs
       says that the text lines following that line in the  pack-
       age  file  up  to  the next package line or the end of the
       file is  a  package  named  directory_stack  and  that  an
       attempt  to  execute  either  pushd, popd or dirs when the
       routine is not  already  defined  will  cause  the  direc-
       tory_stack portion of the package file to be loaded.

       This functionality is provided by Extended Tcl.
