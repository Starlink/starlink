#  Name:
#     remove-modules

#  Purpose:
#     Remove git submodules from a working tree.

#  Type of Module:
#     Bourne shell script

#  Usage:
#     remove-modules [-f] [submodule]

#  Description:
#     This script removes the content of the given submodule, or all
#     submodules if ran without any arguments. It is destructive so
#     should be used with care.
#
#     If any submodule contains local changes then this script will refuse
#     to run. You will need to correct the problem that represents before
#     running this script.
#
#     A typical use of this script is to clear out all submodules in a
#     working tree where update-modules has been ran, before switching
#     to an historical release branch. Historical branches contain the
#     original source in place of the submodules (the last of these
#     is lehuakona).
#
#     In extreme circumstances when you do not have any changes to preserve
#     and the submodules are in a mess the "-f" flag can be used to skip all
#     safety checks.
