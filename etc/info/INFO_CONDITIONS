The text below (after the '***' line) is the form of the Starlink
software licence which was used until the Project moved to a GPL
licence in 2003.

At that point, the Project's `conditions' statement changed to the
following:



The Starlink Software Collection is Copyright (C) 1980-2003, Council
for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (``CCLRC''),
except where noted internally, or discussed below.

The Starlink Project has recently made the decision to license its own
software under the GNU General Public License (GPL) as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version. However, this transition is not, and
may never be, complete, and the following points should be borne in
mind.

* All the code produced by the Starlink Project itself is copyright
  CCLRC and is distributed under the terms of the GPL.

* Some software packages include a CONDITIONS statement which refers
  to, or contains the text within, <THIS FILE>. These are also copyright
  CCLRC and this conditions statement should be taken to refer instead
  to the GPL.

* Some packages include third-party code which is either non-GPL code
  or whose copyright and licence status is unclear. These packages are
  therefore not (or not clearly) GPL.

* Some packages consist largely of code donated in gentler times, when
  issues of copyright and licences were unimportant and largely
  unrecorded. For these packages, some or all of the licence,
  copyright and even authorship is unknown, but they cannot be safely
  taken to be public domain. You can safely assume only that they have
  a broad `academic use only' licence. This set of packages includes
  at least Figaro.

If you wish to use the code for a purpose for which the licence
conditions, authorship or copyright are important, you should consult
the project at ussc@star.rl.ac.uk.

This Software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this Software; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301
USA. You can also find the GPL on the GNU web site.

Some of the code distributed here refers to an earlier version of the
Starlink Software Licence, located at

http://www.starlink.ac.uk/store/conditions.html

which permitted non-commercial use only. This licence has been
superseded, and any references to that licence should be taken to
refer to this licence instead.

In addition, we ask you to consider acknowledging the Collection in
any program or publication in which you use it. For general
publications, we suggest `The authors acknowledge the data analysis
facilities provided by the Starlink Project which is run by CCLRC on
behalf of PPARC.

                       =========================

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this document is to state the terms and conditions
under which Starlink software, documentation, data and other associated
material ("the Software") may be used.

NOTICE TO USER:

BY USING THE SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS
WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.

1. The Software is owned by the Council for the Central Laboratory of the
Research Councils ("CCLRC"), unless a statement to the contrary appears
within the Software itself.

2. The Software is made available free of charge for use by:

	a) private individuals for non-profit research; and

	b) non-profit educational, academic and research institutions.

3. Commercial use of the Software is specifically excluded from the terms
and conditions of this licence.  Commercial use of the Software is subject
to the prior written agreement of CCLRC on terms to be agreed.

4. The provision of any version of the Software under the terms and
conditions specified herein does not imply that future versions will also
be made available under the same terms and conditions.

5. The user may modify the Software for his own purposes.  The user may
distribute the modified software provided that CCLRC is informed and that
a copy of the modified software is made available to CCLRC on request.
All modifications made by the user shall be clearly identified to show how
the modified software differs from the original Software.

6. In any published work produced by the user and which includes results
achieved by using the Software, the user shall acknowledge that the Software
was used in producing the information contained in such publication.

7. The user may incorporate or embed the Software into other software
products which he may then give away free of charge but not sell provided
the user makes due acknowledgement of the use which he has made of the
Software in creating such software products.   Any redistribution of the
Software in this way shall be made under the same terms and conditions
under which the user received it from CCLRC.

8. The user shall not cause the Software to be brought into disrepute,
either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or by inappropriate
modification.

9. The Software is provided to the user "as is" and CCLRC makes no warranty
as to its suitability or performance.   CCLRC does not and cannot warrant the
performance or results which the user may obtain by using the Software.
CCLRC makes no warranties, express or implied, as to non-infringement of
third party rights, merchantability, or fitness for any particular purpose.
In no event will CCLRC be liable to the user for any consequential,
incidental, or special damages, including any lost profits or lost savings,
even if a CCLRC representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
claim by any third party.
