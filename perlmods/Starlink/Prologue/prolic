=head1 NAME

prolic - Add licence and copyright to a standard prologue.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  prolic *.f
  cat test.f | prolic

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If file names are provided, the files are analysed and if a licence
or copyright are required, they are added and the files rewritten.

If the source code is piped from stdin, the file is read and written to
stdout, modifying if necessary.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-incdefs>

Include fields that only include default content. Default is to skip empty fields
if they will only result in default content.

=item B<-copyright>

Override the default copyright text (usually Starlink derived CLRC, SERC, PPARC, 
or STFC) with the supplied value. It should be quoted.

=item B<-version>

Report the version number.

=item B<-help>

Display the help information.

=item B<-man>

Display the full manual page.
