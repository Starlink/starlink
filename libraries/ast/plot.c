*class++
*  Name:
*     Plot

*  Purpose:
*     Provide facilities for 2D graphical output.

*  Constructor Function:
c     astPlot
f     AST_PLOT

*  Description:
*     This class provides facilities for producing 2D graphical output.
*     A Plot is a specialised form of FrameSet, in which the base
*     Frame describes a "graphical" coordinate system and is
*     associated with a rectangular plotting area in the underlying
*     graphics system. This plotting area is where graphical output
*     appears. It is defined when the Plot is created.
*
*     The current Frame of a Plot describes a "physical" coordinate
*     system, which is the coordinate system in which plotting
*     operations are specified. The results of each plotting operation
*     are automatically transformed into graphical coordinates so as
*     to appear in the plotting area (subject to any clipping which
*     may be in effect).
*
*     Because the Mapping between physical and graphical coordinates
*     may often be non-linear, or even discontinuous, most plotting
*     does not result in simple straight lines. The basic plotting
*     element is therefore not a straight line, but a geodesic curve
c     (see astCurve, astGenCurve and astPolyCurve). A Plot also provides facilities for
c     drawing markers or symbols (astMark), text (astText) and grid lines
c     (astGridLine). It is also possible to draw curvilinear axes with
c     optional coordinate grids (astGrid).
f     (see AST_CURVE, AST_GENCURVE and AST_POLYCURVE). A Plot also provides facilities
f     for drawing markers or symbols (AST_MARK), text (AST_TEXT) and grid
f     lines (AST_GRIDLINE). It is also possible to draw curvilinear axes
f     with optional coordinate grids (AST_GRID).
*     A range of Plot attributes is available to allow precise control
*     over the appearance of graphical output produced by these
c     functions.
f     routines.
*
*     You may select different physical coordinate systems in which to
*     plot (including the native graphical coordinate system itself)
*     by selecting different Frames as the current Frame of a Plot,
*     using its Current attribute.  You may also set up clipping (see
c     astClip) to limit the extent of any plotting you perform, and
f     AST_CLIP) to limit the extent of any plotting you perform, and
*     this may be done in any of the coordinate systems associated
*     with the Plot, not necessarily the one you are plotting in.
*
*     Like any FrameSet, a Plot may also be used as a Frame. In this
*     case, it behaves like its current Frame, which describes the
*     physical coordinate system.
*
*     When used as a Mapping, a Plot describes the inter-relation
*     between graphical coordinates (its base Frame) and physical
*     coordinates (its current Frame).  It differs from a normal
*     FrameSet, however, in that an attempt to transform points which
*     lie in clipped areas of the Plot will result in bad coordinate
*     values (AST__BAD).

*  Inheritance:
*     The Plot class inherits from the FrameSet class.

*     In addition to those attributes common to all FrameSets, every
*     Plot also has the following attributes:

*  Graphical Elements:
*     The colour index, character font, character size, line style and
*     line width used for plotting can be set independently for
*     various elements of the graphical output produced by a Plot.
*     The different graphical elements are identified by appending the
*     strings listed below as subscripts to the Plot attributes
*     Colour(element), Font(element), Size(element), Style(element)
*     and Width(element). These strings are case-insensitive and
*     unambiguous abbreviations may be used. Elements of the graphical
*     output which relate to individual axes can be referred to either
*     independently (e.g. "(Grid1)" and "(Grid2)" ) or together (e.g.
*     "(Grid)"):

*  History:
*     18-SEP-1996 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     25-FEB-1997 (RFWS):
*        Tidied all public prologues.
*     18-AUG-1997 (DSB):
*        Changes made to ensure that the first label on each axis is
*        never abbreviated, and to avoid segmentation violation when NumLab
*        is set to zero.
*     1-SEP-1997 (DSB):
*        astGetGap changed so that it returns the default value which will
*        be used (instead of AST__BAD) if no value has been set for Gap.
*        The Border attribute modified so that it is off (zero) by default.
*     19-SEP-1997 (DSB):
*        o  Check that something has been plotted before using the bounding
*        box to determine title and label positions.
*        o  Fixed bug which caused a tick mark at the pole to be draw at
*        a random angle.
*        o  The size of the increment used to determine the tangent to a grid
*        line at the position to a label has been reduced to make sure the
*        labls are drawn parallel to grid line.
*        o  Correct the logic for catering with reversed axes when determining
*        the displacement of a label's reference point from the associated
*        axis.
*        o  Corrected logic which determined if two numerical labels overlap.
*        o  Corrected logic for determining when to abbreviate numerical
*        labels.
*        o  Use of strtok replaced by local function FindWord.
*        o  Correct logic which determines which side of the axis to draw
*        tick marks when using interior labelling.
*        o  If the base Frame of the FrameSet supplied to astPlot has more
*        than 2 axes, then use a sub-frame formed from the first two axes,
*        instead of simply reporting an error.
*        o  If the current Frame of the Plot supplied to astGrid or
*        astBorder has more than 2 axes, then use a sub-frame formed from
*        the first two axes, instead of simply reporting an error.
*        o  Default for Border is now to draw the border if exterior
*        Labelling is used, but not to draw it if interior labelling is
*        used.
*        o  Public astGet function now returns actual used values for all
*        attributes. Protected astGetXyz functions still return the requested
*        value (which may differ from the used value), or the "unset" value
*        if no value has been set for the attribute.
*        o  The defaults for Edge now depend on Labelling. If exterior
*        labelling was requested but cannot be produced using defaults of
*        Edge(1)=Bottom and Edge(2)=Left, then these default Edge values
*        are swapped. If exterior labelling is still not possible, the
*        original default Edge values are re-instated.
*        o  Unset attributes which use dynamic defaults are now flagged as
*        "unhelpful" in the dump function.
*        o  Added attribute Escape which allows text strings to include
*        escape sequences (see function GrText). This attribute and
*        associated functionality is currently not available for use, search
*        for all occurences of ENABLE-ESCAPE for instructions on how to
*        enable the facilities.
*        o  Strings now used instead of integers to represent "choice"
*        attributes externally (eg Edge and Labelling).
*     24-NOV-1997 (DSB):
*        o  Fixed bug in function Grid which caused units to be included in
*        SkyFrame axis labels by default.
*        o  Replaced calls to DrawText by calls to astGText, and replaced
*        references to "U" and "D" justifications by "T" and "B". This
*        stops labels drifting to the bottom left when GAIA zooms.
*     23-MAR-1998 (DSB):
*        Added extra checks on global status into routine Grid to avoid
*        segmentation violations occuring due to null pointers being used.
*     10-JUN-1998 (DSB):
*        Modify DrawTicks so that ticks are drawn closer to singularities
*        than previously. Also normalise this constraint to the screen size
*        rather than the length of a major tick mark.
*     28-OCT-1998 (DSB):
*        o  Added method astPolyCurve.
*        o  Extract the Current Frame from the Plot prior to using Frame
*        methods such as astOffset, astNorm, etc.
*        o  PlotLabel modified to ensure labels are abbreviated even if
*        they are next to the "root" label (i.e. the label with most
*        trailing zeros).
*        o  Modified description of Width attribute. Width no longer gives
*        the absolute line width in inches. Instead it is a scale factor,
*        where 1.0 corresponds to a "typical thin line" on the device.
*        o  Modified LabelUnits attribute so that the default value is zero
*        for SkyAxes and non-zero for other Axes.
*     10-DEC-1998 (DSB):
*        Modified all calls to the "pow" maths function to avoid using
*        literal constants as arguments. This seems to cause segmentation
*        violations on some systems.
*     16-JUL-1999 (DSB):
*        Fixed memory leaks in EdgeCrossings and EdgeLabels.
*     16-SEP-1999 (DSB):
*        Avoid writing out clipping limits if they are undefined.
*     12-OCT-1999 (DSB):
*        o  Modified use of the NumLab attribute so that setting it to zero
*        does not prevent exterior labels from being produced.
*        o  Allow length of tick marks to be specified separately for
*        both axes.
*     13-OCT-2000 (DSB):
*        o Purge zero length sections from CurveData structures.
*        o Increase tolerance for edge labels from 0.0005 to 0.005.
*     9-JAN-2001 (DSB):
*        o  Change argument "in" for astMark and astPolyCurve from type
*        "const double (*)[]" to "const double *".
*        o  Check success of astReadString before using the returned
*        pointer.
*        o  Change method for choosing default LabelAt values to ignore
*        values which produce no visible labels.
*     10-JAN-2001 (DSB):
*        o  Modified FindMajTick to choose the size of fillable holes in
*        the axis range on the basis of the number of ticks on the axis.
*        This avoids holes being visible in the displayed tick marks when
*        using very small gaps.
*     22-MAY-2001 (DSB):
*        Added a check when using interior labelling, to ensure that the
*        most appropriate edges are used for text labels.
*     13-JUN-2001 (DSB):
*        Added public method astGenCurve, astGrfSet, astGrfPop, astGrfPush.
*        Made DrawAxes attribute axis specific.
*     4-JUL-2001 (DSB):
*        The Crv function used to have a restriction that if *any*
*        subsection was very short, then *none* of the subsections were
*        subdivided. This meant that long subsections which needed
*        subdividing were not subdivided if there was also a very short
*        subsection. To get round this problem the restriction was changed
*        to "if *all* subsections are very short then none are divided.
*        This was implemented by changing dl2_min to dl2_max, and adding
*        a check for very short segments (which are then not sub-divided).
*     16-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        Remove the check for very short segments introduced above, as it
*        caused south pole tan projection to include some spurious lines.
*     20-SEP-2001 (DSB):
*        - Initialize baseframe to NULL in astInitPlot (prevents segvios).
*        - Modified astInitPlot to allow the "frame" argument to the astPlot
*        constructor to be a Plot.
*     10-JAN-2002 (DSB):
*       - Added axis-specific graphical elements "axis1", "axis2", etc.
*       - FullForm returns a match without ambiguity if the test string
*       matches an option exactly, including length.
*     31-JAN-2002 (DSB):
*       - Added RejectOOB to reject tick marks which are not in their primary
*       domain.
*     14-FEB-2002 (DSB):
*       - Relaxed the conditions for equality within the EQUALS macro.
*       Guard aginst no ticks being found.
*     18-FEB-2002 (DSB):
*       - Make a permanent copy of any old axis format string in TickMarks.
*       Previously a mere pointer into the astGet string buffer was stored,
*       which could be over-written after many calls to astGet.
*       - If a user specifies an axis format, use it whether or not it
*       results in any identical adjacent labels.
*     4-MAR-2002 (DSB):
*       - Made fairly extesive changes to the creation and use of tick
*       mark values in order to circumvent problems with CAR projections,
*       and "1 to many" mappings (such as 2D cartesian->polar). The
*       policy now is that axis normalization is only performed when
*       necessary (i.e. to create labels for display, etc). Tick mark
*       values are stored and handled as non-normalized values as much as
*       possible.
*     13-JUN-2002 (DSB):
*       Modified Norm1 to prevent major tick value from being removed if
*       the supplied reference value is out of bounds, resulting in the
*       Mapping producing bad values
*     14-JUN-2002 (DSB):
*       Re-wrote PlotLabels to improve abbreviation of labels and the
*       choice of which labels not to print.
*     14-AUG-2002 (DSB):
*       - Added method astBoundingBox.
*       - Added attribute Invisible.
*       - Correct handling of "axis specific" plot elements cuch as
*       (Axis1), (Axis2), etc.
*     12-SEP-2002 (DSB):
*       - Modified Map1 to remove slow normalization method (it is now
*       faster but the changes result in some longer-than-needed grids
*       lines when (e.g.) plotting pixel coordins in Polar coords).
*       - Modified Axlot so that SkyFrames positions which are out of
*       their normal ranges are not rejected by Map1.
*     10-OCT-2002 (DSB):
*       grfAttrs:Modified to test element attributes explicitly using the
*       relevant TestUse<attr> functions, instead of relying on the
*       "GetUse<attr>" function returning the NO<attr> constant if not set.
*       - Modified Axplot so that SkyFrames positions which are out of
*       their normal ranges are not rejected by Map1.
*       - Only use tick marks which are within the axis range given by the
*       Bottom and Top Axis attributes.
*       - Norm1: If the normalized current frame coords are bad, do not
*       reinstate the original unnormalized values. For instance, current
*       Frame values which are outside the valid domain of the projection
*       should result in bad values when normalized, not the original
*       good values. The original comment stated "If the normalization
*       produced bad coords (e.g. as may happen if the supplied refernce
*       value corresponds to a point on the line through the tick mark
*       which is outside the valid region of the mapping) leave the original
*       tick mark values unchanged".
*       - GetTicks: Limit maxticks to be no less than 8.
*     8-JAN-2003 (DSB):
*        - Changed private InitVtab method to protected astInitPlotVtab
*        method.
*        - Use private IsASkyFrame method in place of astIsASkyFrame.
*        - Modify PlotLabels to excluding exponents when counting trailing
*        zeros, and also to pad trailing fields with trailing zeros up to
*        the max number of decimal places when estimating label priorities.
*        - Modified Overlap to ensure that axis labels are speced by at
*        least two spaces.
*     22-JAN-2003 (DSB):
*        - Modified PlotLabels so that labels are rejected in a regular
*        pattern rather than semi-random.
*        - Modified the way PlotLabels abbreviates leading fields.
*        - Introdued the skipbad parameter for the Crv function, in order
*        to provide some degree of protection against the Crv algorithm
*        skipping over small sections of valid coordinates (such as when
*        a curve crosses the plot very close to a corner of the plot).
*     25-MAR-2003 (DSB):
*        - Modified FindMajTicks to avoid losing tick marks when dealing
*        with high precision data.
*     8-AUG-2003 (DSB):
*        - Modified PlotLabels to ensure that the root label for the
*        second axis is not omitted due to it overlapping a label from
*        the first axis (a different root label is now chosen if this would
*        be the case).
*        - Modify FindMajTicks to avoid tick marks which should be at
*        exactly zero being placed at some very small non-zero axis value.
*     22-OCT-2003 (DSB):
*        - DrawTicks modified to correctly reset graphical attributes and
*        pass on to the next axis if an axis has zero length major and minor
*        tick marks.
*     9-JAN-2004 (DSB):
*        DrawGrid: Report error if no grid curves can be drawn.
*        AxPlot: Initialise returned CDATA structure before checking argument
*        validity.
*        GetTicks: Calculate the reference value on the other axis using
*        function "Typical" rather than simply using the man of the supplied
*        values (the supplied values may be clustered around 0 and 2*PI if the
*        field is centred on the origin, resulting in the mean being at about
*        1.PI and therefore inappropriate).
*     13-JAN-2004 (DSB):
*        - Added LogPlot attribute, and the facility for mapping the base
*        coordinate system logarithmically onto the plotting area instead of
*        linearly.
*        - Added LogTicks attribute, and the facility for spacing the
*        major tick marks logarithmically instead of linearly.
*        - Added LogGap attribute, and the facility for storing separate
*        gap sizes for linear and log tick spacing.
*     15-JAN-2004 (DSB):
*        - Added LogLabel attribute.
*        - Re-instated the inclusion of escape sequences in strings (see
*        function GrText).
*     12-FEB-2004 (DSB):
*        - RightVector: Corrected usage of chh and chv.
*        - GQch and GScales: Check that values returned by grf module are
*          usable.
*        - DrawAxis: Extend axis section by one section (if possible) at
*        each end (overcomes problems where the axis does not reach a pole).
*        - DrawAxis: Check axis does not extend beyond a pole.
*        - Labels: Correct logic of loop which plots interior labels
*        (previously it missed out labels if there were only 3)
*        - Allow for some rounding error in FindMajTicks when comparing an
*        axis value with a loweror upper axis limit.
*     19-FEB-2004 (DSB):
*        - Reduced the dynamic range restriction for log ticks from 2 decades
*        to 1.
*        - Temporarily clear any error status before re-instating the
*        original Format in TickMarks.
*        - Add LogTicks to the GetAttrib function so that the value of the
*        LogTicks attribute can be got by the public.
*        - Modify Crv to include a check that he vector scale has not
*        changed much between adjacent segments.
*        - Modify Crv so that a segment is only subdivided if at least
*        half of the subsegments are longer than the shortest significant
*        length. Also put a restriction on subdivision so that
*        subdivision only occurs if the bounding box of the segment being
*        sub-divided is smaller than the bounding box of its parent
*        segment.
*     27-FEB-2004 (DSB):
*        - Reduce the default Tol value from 0.001 to 0.01 in order to
*        speed up curve drawing..
*        - Use 0.1*Tol in Boundary because the boundary tracing algorithm
*        seems to produce much worse visible errors than it should do for a
*        given Tol.
*     2-MAR-2004 (DSB):
*        - Corrected handling of bounding boxes in Crv so that
*        subdivision is allowed if the bounding box shrinks on only 1 axis
*        (previously required shrinkage on both axes but this fails if
*        all the points are on a horizontal or vertical line).
*        - Modified FindMajTicks to use a better algorithm for finding an
*        appropriate nfill value (previously logplot=1 axes could have
*        unfilled holes at the high end).
*        - Modified GetTicks so that FindMajTicks is not called
*        repeatedly with the same gap size.
*        - Modify AxPlot/Map1 so that the axis curve is sampled logarithmically
*        if the corresponding axis is mapped logarithmically.
*     10-MAR-2004 (DSB):
*        - Modified Typical to give less weight to vaalues close to the
*        edges of the range covered by the plotting area.
*        - Increased minimum angle between curve and edge required to
*        create an edge label from 3 degs to 5 degs.
*        - Modified PlotLabels to ignore duplicate adjacent labels which
*        determining overlap of labels.
*     17-MAR-2004 (DSB):
*        - Modified Typical to give normal weight to edge bins in
*        histogram if these bins contain all the counts.
*        - Modified DrawTicks to add extra minor ticks below first major
*        tick value and above last major tick value.
*        - Norm1 can reject usable tick mark values because of an
*        inappropriate value being used on the other axis (i.e. one for
*        which the position is undefined in grapics coords). Therfoer
*        Norm1 has been modified to use 3 different reference values
*        in an attempt to find one which gives good axis values.
*     25-AUG-2004 (DSB):
*        - Correct handling of "fmt" pointer in TickMarks function (identified
*        and reported by Bill Joye).
*     14-SEP-2004 (DSB):
*        - In EdgeLabels change definition of "distinct labels". Used to
*        be that labels were distinct if they had different formatted
*        labels. Now they are distinct if they have different floating
*        point numerical values. Fixes a bug reported by Micah Johnson.
*        - TickMarks re-structured to optimise the precision (no. of digits)
*        even if a value has been assigned for the Format attribute, but only
*        if the format specifier includes a wildcard precision specifier. For
*        instance, to get graphical separators a format must be specified
*        which included the "g" flag. As things were, this would prevent
*        the optimisation of the digits value. Can now use "dms.*g" to
*        allow the number of digits to be optimised.
*     29-SEP-2004 (DSB):
*        - In FindMajTicks, begin the process of increasing "nfill" from
*        a value of zero rather than one (in many cases no filling is
*        needed).
*        - In GetTicks (linear tick marks section) ensure that 10
*        *different* gap sizes are used before giving up. Previously, the
*        10 tests could include duplicated gap values.
*     8-NOV-2004 (DSB):
*        - In Norm1, try more alternative "other axis" values before
*        accepting that a tick mark value cannot be normalised.
*     2-FEB-2005 (DSB):
*        - Avoid using astStore to allocate more storage than is supplied
*        in the "data" pointer. This can cause access violations since
*        astStore will then read beyond the end of the "data" area.
*     15-MAR-2005 (DSB):
*        - Modified GridLines to use appropriate algorithm for choosing
*        start of grid lines in cases where one axis has logarithmic tick
*        spacing and the other has linear tick spacing.
*     21-MAR-2005 (DSB):
*        - Added the Clip attribute.
*     12-JUL-2005 (DSB):
*        - Modified AxPlot so that Map1 only normalises if neither axis
*        is a SkyAxis. Previously it normalised if either axis was not a
*        SkyAxis.
*     7-DEC-2005 (DSB):
*        Free memory allocated by calls to astReadString.
*     18-JAN-2006 (DSB)
*        Add Abbrev attribute.
*     14-FEB-2006 (DSB)
*        Correct EdgeLabels to use gap size rather than EQUAL macro when
*        comparing label values.
*     17-FEB-2006 (DSB)
*        Added escape sequences "%h+" and "%g+".
*     21-MAR-2006 (DSB)
*        Added extra status checks in TickMarks.
*     18-MAY-2006 (DSB)
*        Trans: use correct PointSet when tranforming to arbitrary
*        clipping frame.
*     26-MAY-2006 (DSB)
*        Added LabelAt to TestAttrib.
*     2-JUN-2006 (DSB)
*        - In MAKE_GET2, return the set value if a value has been set
*        without recalculating the defaults.
*        - Fix bug that could cause segvio in Grid if clipping is used.
*     5-JUN-2006 (DSB)
*        Do not change the box returned by astBoundBox as a consequence
*        of calling astGetAttrib.
*     19-JUN-2006 (DSB)
*        Changed the default line 0.0 from zero to 1.0.
*     22-JUN-2006 (DSB)
*        Include axis textual labels and title in the bounding box
*        created by AST_GRID and returned by AST_BOUNDINGBOX.
*     26-JUN-2006 (DSB)
*        Set the Direction attribute in the base Frame of a Plot if an
*        axis is reversed.
*     29-JUN-2006 (DSB)
*        - Guard against astGap calls that reach a minimum gap size.
*        - Sort out splitting of long axis labels (such as date/time
*        strings produced by TimeFrames).
*     30-JUN-2006 (DSB)
*        If abbreviating labels, display the last field for identical
*        neighbours rather than the whole value.
*     10-JUL-2006 (DSB)
*        Make astStripEscapes public so it can be used by the NDF library.
*     7-AUG-2006 (DSB)
*        Increase the number of attempts to find a new gap size from 5 to
*        25 in GetTicks.
*     24-OCT-2006 (DSB)
*        Add the ForceExterior attribute so that SPLAT can have external
*        axes even if there are no usable horizontal axis ticks (as requested
*        by PWD). Currently this attribute is not included in the public
*        documentation, as it may cause problems. If it seems to work OK
*        then it can be made public.
*     25-JAN-2006 (DSB)
*        Do not draw ticks marks that start outside the bounds of the
*        axis they are labelling.
*     27-FEB-2007 (DSB)
*        - Change nominal Crv_scerr value from 5.0 to 1.5 (this avoids gaps
*        in HPX grid plots being bridged by grid lines).
*        - Double the dimension of the grid used by GoodGrid to avoid
*        missing the pointy bits in a HPX projection.
*     17-MAY-2007 (DSB)
*        Exclude corner positions when determining the range of axis
*        values covered by the plot. This gives better default gap sizes.
*     11-JUN-2007 (DSB)
*        Plug memory leaks.
*     20-JUN-2007 (DSB)
*        - Add attribute GrfContext.
*        - Pass the GrfContext attribute value to each external grf function.
*        External code that uses the astGrfSet function must be changed
*        so that the external grf functions registered using astGrfSet
*        accept this new parameter.
*     21-JUN-2007 (DSB)
*        - Change GrfContext to be an Object rather than an integer.
*     22-JUN-2007 (DSB)
*        - Do not dump the GrfContext Object since it may cause an
*        infinite dumping loop.
*        - Allow a NULL vtab to be supplied when initialising a Plot
*        structure. This causes the vtab defined locally within this
*        class to be used so that the new object behaves as a simple Plot.
*     25-JUN-2007 (DSB)
*        - Free the graphics context object when then the Plot is deleted.
*        - Fix memory leak in FullForm.
*        - Since the grfcontext object is only used by external code, store
*          a public object identifier for it in the Plot structure rather
*          than a true C pointer.
*     26-JUN-2007 (DSB)
*        Honour the LabelUp attribute value even if labels are drawn
*        around the edges of the plot.
*     28-JUN-2007 (DSB)
*        - Make all axis attribute arrays 3 elements long rather than 2.
*        - Add the protected methods astCopyPlotDefaults and astMirror.
*        - Add public method astGetGrfContext, remove astSetGrfContext.
*        - Fix memory leak.
*     6-SEP-2007 (DSB):
*        Dump and load any user-specified tick mark values.
*     20-OCT-2009 (DSB):
*        - Modify SplitValue so that it only splits long values if
*        previous long values were split, or if the value contains a
*        space.
*        - Take account of zero height bounding boxes in UpdateConcat.
*        - Correct Dump so that it dumps attributes for all available
*        axes (2 for a Plot, 3 for a Plot3D).
*     12-JAN-2010 (DSB):
*        Fix various memory leaks.
*     4-MAR-2011 (DSB):
*        - Added grf functions BBuf and EBuf.
*        - Added public method astBBuf and astEBuf.
*     23-AUG-2011 (DSB):
*        - If exterior labelling was requested but would produced too
*        few labels, only swap to interior labelling if doing so would
*        allow more labels to be drawn (i.e. do not swap to interior if
*        it does not gain us anything).
*        - Slightly decrease the dynamic range of an axis needed to produce
*        logarithmic ticks (this is to avoid problems with round errors).
*     6-OCT-2011 (DSB):
*        - Prevent grf qch and scales functions being called lots of times
*        during each drawing operation (since the information returned by
*        these functions will not change during the course of a single drawing
*        operation).
*     11-OCT-2011 (DSB):
*        - Combine multiple continuous polylines into a single polyline
*        before calling the grf polyline function. Reducing the number of
*        calls to the underlying graphics system can make a big difference
*        if the graphics system is written in an interpreted language
*        such as python.
*        - Take account of differing axis scales when rotating vectors by
*        90 degrees.
*     12-OCT-2011 (DSB):
*        - Fix the change made yesterday to correct rotation of numerical axis
*        rotations. I forgot that the astGText function in the grf module
*        expects the up vector in equally scaled coords, not graphics coords.
*        - Take account of unequal axis scales when working out the
*        length of each grid curve.
*     15-OCT-2011 (DSB):
*        Always check that the grf module implements the scales function
*        before trying to invoke the scales function.
*     21-MAY-2012 (DSB):
*        Correct text strings used to represent the "Labelling" attribute
*        within dumps of a Plot. Previously they were reversed.
*     7-JUN-2012 (DSB):
*        Speed up plotting of CmpRegion boundaries by splitting the
*        CmpRegion up into a set of disjoint Regions, and plotting each
*        one separately.
*     16-JUN-2014 (DSB):
*        - Prevent seg fault in PlotLabels caused by accessing
*        uninitialised "atext" field stored within purged labels.
*        - Choose a label with non-negative priority as the fall-back root label.

*  Class Membership:
*     Defined by the Plot class.

*     consequently rather slow.

*  Parameters:

*        The name of the attribute whose value is to be obtained, as it
*        appears in the function name (e.g. Label in "astGetLabel"). The
*        string "Used" is added on to the front of the supplied value.
*     type
*        The C type of the attribute.
*     bad_value
*        A constant value to return if the global error status is set, or if
*        the function fails.
*     assign
*        An expression that evaluates to the value to be returned. This can
*        use the string "axis" to represent the zero-based value index.
*     nval
*        Specifies the number of values in the multi-valued attribute. The
*        "axis" values supplied to the created function should be in the

*  Purpose:
*     Interval between major axis values of a Plot.

*  Type:
*     Public attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     Floating point.

*  Description:
*     This attribute controls the appearance of an annotated
c     coordinate grid (drawn with the astGrid function) by determining
f     coordinate grid (drawn with the AST_GRID routine) by determining
*     the logarithmic interval between the "major" axis values of a Plot, at
*     which (for example) major tick marks are drawn. It takes a separate
*     value for each physical axis of the Plot so that, for instance,
*     the setting "LogGap(2)=100.0" specifies the ratio between adjacent major
*     values along the second axis. The LogGap attribute is only used when
*     the LogTicks attribute indicates that the spacing between major axis
*     values is to be logarithmic. If major axis values are linearly spaced
*     then the gap is specified using attribute Gap.
*
*     The LogGap value supplied will be rounded to the nearest power of 10.
*     The reciprocal of the supplied value may be used if this is necessary
*     to produce usable major axis values. If a zero or negative value is
*     supplied, an error will be reported when the grid is drawn. The default
*     behaviour is for the Plot to generate its own LogGap value when
*     required, based on the range of axis values to be represented.

*  Applicability:
*     Plot
*        All Plots have this attribute.

*  Notes:
*     - The LogGap value is a ratio between axis values and is therefore
*     dimensionless.
*     - If no axis is specified, (e.g. "LogGap" instead of "LogGap(2)"),
*     then a "set" or "clear" operation will affect the attribute

*  Description:
*     This attribute controls the appearance of all graphics produced by
*     the Plot, by determining whether the axes of the plotting surface
*     are mapped logarithmically or linearly onto the base Frame of the
*     FrameSet supplied when the Plot was constructed. It takes a separate
*     value for each axis of the graphics coordinate system (i.e. the
*     base Frame in the Plot) so that, for instance, the setting
*     "LogPlot(2)=1" specifies that the second axis of the graphics
*     coordinate system (usually the vertical axis) should be mapped
*     logarithmically onto the second axis of the base Frame of the
*     FrameSet supplied when the Plot was constructed.
*
*     If the LogPlot value of a Plot axis is non-zero, it causes that
*     axis to be mapped logarithmically, otherwise (the default) the axis
*     is mapped linearly.

*  Applicability:
*     Plot
*        All Plots have this attribute.

*  Notes:
*     - The setting of the LogPlot attribute provides the default value
*     for the related LogTicks attribute. By selecting suitable values for
*     LogPlot and LogTicks, it is possible to have tick marks which are evenly
*     spaced in value but which are mapped logarithmically onto the screen
*     (and vice-versa).
*     - An axis may only be mapped logarithmically if the visible part of
*     the axis does not include the value zero. The visible part of the
*     axis is that part which is mapped onto the plotting area, and is
*     measured within the base Frame of the FrameSet which was supplied when

*     specifies that the major tick marks on the second axis should be

*
*     If the LogTicks value for a physical axis is non-zero, the major

*     major tick marks). An error will be reported if the dynamic range of

*     will be evenly spaced (that is, there will be a constant difference
*     between the axis values at adjacent major tick marks). The default is
*     to produce logarithmically spaced tick marks if the corresponding
*     LogPlot attribute is non-zero and the ratio of maximum axis value

*
*     For each axis, the TextLabGap value gives the spacing between the

*     of the annotated grid (excluding other descriptive labels). The gap
*     is measured to the nearest edge of the label (i.e. the top or the

*     Plot, starting at the specified position. The algorithm used can handle
*     discontinuities in the Mapping between the current Frame and graphics
*     coordinates, and information describing any breaks in the curve
*     (including the start and end of the curve) are returned in the supplied
*     AstPlotCurveData structure.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Plot.
*     axis
*        The zero-based index of an axis within the current Frame of the Plot.
*        The curve has a varying value on this axis.
*     start
*        A pointer to a an array holding the coordinates of the start of the

*     length
*        The length of the section of the curve to be drawn, given as an
*        increment along the axis specified by parameter "axis".
*     ink
*        If zero, the curve is not actually drawn, but information about
*        the breaks is still returned. If non-zero, the curve is also drawn.
*     cdata
*        A pointer to a structure in which to return information about the
*        breaks in the curve.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Name:

*  Purpose:

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     int Boundary( AstPlot *this, const char *method, const char *class, int *status  )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot method.

*  Description:
*     This function draws a boundary around the regions of the plotting
*     area which contain valid, unclipped, physical coordinates, but does
*     not include the intersections with the edges of the plotting area.
*
*     Broadly, the algorithm is as follows: An initial coarse grid is
*     created covering the entire plotting area. This grid consists of a
*     regular square matrix of points in graphics coordinates, and the
*     corresponding physical coordinates. An array of flags is created,
*     one for each grid cell, indicating if the boundary passes through the
*     cell. This is assumed to be the case if the cell has a mix of good and
*     bad corners (i.e corners which have good or bad physical coordinates).
*     This assumption does not locate all boundary cells though, since if
*     the boundary passes into and out of a cell throught the same edge,
*     the corners of the cell will be either all good or all bad. But for
*     the moment, we just concentrate on the ones found using this simple
*     assumption. For each such cell, a finer grid is then created covering
*     the cell, and the boundary is drawn through this fine grid using
*     TraceBorder. TraceBorder returns a set of four flags indicating which
*     edges of the cell were intersected by the boundary. A check is then
*     made on any of the four neighbouring cells into which the curve
*     passes. If any of these cells were not flagged as boundary cells using
*     the simple assumption described earlier, then they are flagged now
*     (with a different flag value). Once all the cells located using the
*     simple assumption have been processed, any further cells flagged
*     with the new flag value are also processed using TraceBorder in the
*     same way. This process is repeated until no extra boundary cells are
*     found.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Plot.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A flag indicating if any regions containing invalid physical
*     coordinates were found within the plotting area.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function assumes the physical coordinate Frame is
*     2-dimensional, and it should not be used if this is not the case.
*     -  A value of zero is returned if an error has already occurred, or
*     if this function should fail for any reason.

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot method.

*  Description:
*     This function draws a (line) border around regions of the
*     plotting area of a Plot which correspond to valid, unclipped
*     physical coordinates. For example, when plotting using an
*     all-sky map projection, this function could be used to draw the
*     boundary of the celestial sphere when it is projected on to the
*     plotting surface.
*
*     If the entire plotting area contains valid, unclipped physical
*     coordinates, then the boundary will just be a rectangular box
*     around the edges of the plotting area.
*
*     If the Plot is a Plot3D, this method is applied individually to
*     each of the three 2D Plots encapsulated within the Plot3D (each of
*     these Plots corresponds to a single 2D plane in the 3D graphics
*     system). In addition, if the entire plotting volume has valid
*     coordinates in the 3D current Frame of the Plot3D, then additional
*     lines are drawn along the edges of the 3D plotting volume so that
*     the entire plotting volume is enclosed within a cuboid grid.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Plot.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astBorder()
f     AST_BORDER = LOGICAL
c        Zero is returned if the plotting space is completely filled by
f        .FALSE. is returned if the plotting space is completely filled by

f        rectangular box was drawn around the edge). Otherwise, .TRUE. is
*        returned.

*  Notes:
c     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
f     - A value of .FALSE. will be returned if this function is invoked
c     with the AST error status set, or if it should fail for any
f     with STATUS set to an error value, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.
*     - An error results if either the current Frame or the base Frame
*     of the Plot is not 2-dimensional or (for a Plot3D) 3-dimensional.
*     - An error also results if the transformation between the base
*     and current Frames of the Plot is not defined (i.e. the Plot's
*     TranForward attribute is zero).

*  Description:
*     This function formats the supplied ticks mark values using the
*     astFormat method for the supplied Frame. Unless force is non-zero, it

*     this
*        Pointer to the Plot.
*     frame
*        Pointer to the Frame.
*     axis
*        The zero-based index of the axis to which the tick marks refer.

*     list
*        Pointer to the start of an array of pointers. Each of the

*        astFree when no longer needed.
*     refval
*        A value to use for the other axis when normalizing.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     Zero if any pairs of identical adjacent labels were found. One
*     otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  No error is reported if a pair of identical adjacent labels is
*     found.
*     -  If an error has already occurred, or if this function should
*     fail for any reason, a value of zero is returned, and the array of

*  Description:
*     This function formats the supplied ticks mark values using the

*     with the corresponding labels supplied in "old_list". If all of the
*     new labels are shorter than, or equal in length to, the old labels,
*     then memory is allocated to hold the new (shorter) labels, and a

*     frame
*        Pointer to the Frame.

*        The number of tick marks supplied by parameter "ticks".
*     old_list
*        Pointer to the start of an array of pointers. Each of the
*        elements in this array should hold a pointer to a string holding a
*        formatted label.
*     refval
*        A value to use for the other axis when normalizing.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to an array of pointers. Each of these pointers points to
*     a text string holding a shortened label. If a complete set of
*     shortened labels could not be found (or if an error occurs), a NULL
*     pointer is returned.

*  Notes:
*     -  The memory holding the returned shortened labels should be

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot method.

*  Description:
c     This function defines regions of a Plot which are to be clipped.
f     This routine defines regions of a Plot which are to be clipped.
*     Any subsequent graphical output created using the Plot will then
*     be visible only within the unclipped regions of the plotting
*     area. See also the Clip attribute.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Plot.
c     iframe
f     IFRAME = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the Frame within the Plot to which the clipping
c        limits supplied in "lbnd" and "ubnd" (below) refer. Clipping
f        limits supplied in LBND and UBND (below) refer. Clipping
*        may be applied to any of the coordinate systems associated
*        with a Plot (as defined by the Frames it contains), so this
*        index may take any value from 1 to the number of Frames in
*        the Plot (Nframe attribute). In addition, the values
*        AST__BASE and AST__CURRENT may be used to specify the base
*        and current Frames respectively.
*
*        For example, a value of AST__CURRENT causes clipping to be
*        performed in physical coordinates, while a value of AST__BASE
*        would clip in graphical coordinates. Clipping may also be
*        removed completely by giving a value of AST__NOFRAME. In this
*        case any clipping bounds supplied (below) are ignored.

c        (identified by the index "iframe"). This should contain the
f        (identified by the index IFRAME). This should contain the
*        lower bound, on each axis, of the region which is to remain
*        visible (unclipped).
c     ubnd
f     UBND( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        An array with one element for each axis of the clipping Frame
c        (identified by the index "iframe"). This should contain the
f        (identified by the index IFRAME). This should contain the
*        upper bound, on each axis, of the region which is to remain
*        visible (unclipped).
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Notes:
c     - Only one clipping Frame may be active at a time. This function
f     - Only one clipping Frame may be active at a time. This routine
*     will deactivate any previously-established clipping Frame before
*     setting up new clipping limits.
c     - The clipping produced by this function is in addition to that
f     - The clipping produced by this routine is in addition to that
*     specified by the Clip attribute which occurs at the edges of the
*     plotting area
c     established when the Plot is created (see astPlot). The
f     established when the Plot is created (see AST_PLOT). The
*     underlying graphics system may also impose further clipping.
*     - When testing a graphical position for clipping, it is first
*     transformed into the clipping Frame. The resulting coordinate on
*     each axis is then checked against the clipping limits (given by
c     "lbnd" and "ubnd"). By default, a position is clipped if any
f     LBND and UBND). By default, a position is clipped if any
*     coordinate lies outside these limits. However, if a non-zero
*     value is assigned to the Plot's ClipOp attribute, then a
*     position is only clipped if the coordinates on all axes lie
*     outside their clipping limits.
*     - If the lower clipping limit exceeds the upper limit for any
*     axis, then the sense of clipping for that axis is reversed (so
*     that coordinate values lying between the limits are clipped
*     instead of those lying outside the limits). To produce a "hole"
*     in a coordinate space (that is, an internal region where nothing
*     is plotted), you should supply all the bounds in reversed order,

c     (e.g. using astTran2), any clipped output points are assigned
f     (e.g. using AST_TRAN2), any clipped output points are assigned

/*
*  Name:

*  Purpose:

*     void Crv( AstPlot *this, double *d, double *x, double *y, int skipbad,
*               double *box, CrvStatics *pstatics, const char *method,
*               const char *class, int *status  )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     This function draws a curve parameterised by the distance from some
*     starting point. The function pointed to by the external variable
*     Crv_map is used to transform distances along the curve into graphics
*     coordinates (X,Y). The supplied function parameters defined the
*     section of the curve to be drawn.
*
*     The algorithm used needs no knowledge about the nature of the mapping
*     performed by Crv_map, and can handle discontinuities in the curve. It
*     first of all determines if any of the segments of the curve can be
*     adequately represented by simply drawing a straight line through the
*     supplied end points. This decision is based on several requirements such
*     as keeping the angle between adjacent sections low and both ends being
*     defined (i.e. X and Y not equal to AST__BAD). Any segments of the curve
*     which satisfy the requirements are draw as straight lines. If any of
*     the supplied curve segments cannot be drawn in this way, then they are
*     split up into a set of evenly-spaced sub-segments and the graphics
*     coordinates at the ends of these sub-segments are found using Crv_map.
*     This function is then called recursively to draw the sub-segments. This
*     recursion is limited in depth by the requirement that all the
*     sub-segments must be longer than a specified lower limit. If this is not
*     the case, then the curve is assumed to be dis-continuous and and the
*     sub-segments are ignored.

*  Parameters:
*     d
*        Pointer to an array of CRV_NPNT values giving the distance along
*        the curve from the starting point to each of CRV_NPNT points. They
*        should increase monotonically, and should be in whatever units are
*        used by the function pointed to by Crv_map. The curve is drawn from
*        d[0] to d[CRV_NPNT].
*     x
*        Pointer to an array of CRV_NPNT values giving the graphics X
*        coordinate for the positions supplied in the array pointed to by
*        parameter "d".
*     y
*        Pointer to an array of CRV_NPNT values giving the graphics Y
*        coordinate for the positions supplied in the array pointed to by
*        parameter "d".
*     skipbad
*        Controls what happens if all the supplied points are bad or
*        outside the plotting area. If skipbad is non-zero, then it is
*        assumed that the supplied points represent an entirely bad (or
*        out of bounds) section of the curve, and this function will
*        return without attempt to sub-divide any of the supplied points.
*        If skipbad is zero, then it is assumed that we may be able to find
*        some good points between the supplied bad points, and therefore
*        this function will attempt to sub-divide the supplied points.
*        Should be supplied as zero on the initial invocation.
*     box
*        Pointer to an array of 4 doubles houlding a bounding box within
*        which the current segment must reside if it is to be sub-divided.
*        Supplied in the order xlo, xhi, ylo, yhi. May be NULL in which
*        case, no check is made on the bounding box.
*     pstatics
*        Pointer to a structure holding values for variables which were
*        statically defined within this function prior to the thread-safe
*        version of AST. If a NULL pointer is supplied, a new structure
*        is created in dynamic memory and initialised.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  External Variables:
*     Crv_nent = int (Read/Write)
*        The number of recursive entries which have been made into
*        this function. This should be set to zero before entering
*        this function for the first time.
*     Crv_ux0 = double (Read/Write)
*        The X component in graphics coordinates of the unit vector
*        along the previous segment of the curve. This should be set
*        to AST__BAD initially to indicate that the previous section
*        is not defined.
*     Crv_uy0 = double (Read/Write)
*        The Y component of the unit vector along the previous segment.
*     Crv_limit = double (Read)
*        The square of the maximum acceptable residual between the
*        drawn curve and the true curve, in graphics coordinates.
*     Crv_scerr = double (Read)
*        If the ratio of the lengths of adjacent sub-segments is larger
*        than Crv_scerr,then the seub-segments will be sub-divided. Note,
*        if either axis is mapped logarithmically onto the screen, then
*        there will naturally be large changes in scale. Crv_scerr should
*        always be larger than 1.0.
*     Crv_map = void (*)( int n, double *dd, double *xx, double *yy,
*                         const char *method, const char *class ) (Read)
*        A pointer to a function which can be called to map "n" distances
*        along the curve (supplied in "dd") into graphics coordinates
*        (stored in "xx" and "yy"). See function "Map1" as an example.
*     Crv_clip = int (Read)
*        Should lines be clipped at the edge of the plotting area?

*  Notes:
*     - The CRV_TRACE conditional compilation blocks in this function
*     provide code which displays the recursive entries made to this
*     function (and also pauses on initial entry until return is pressed).
*     It is useful for investigating the details of the drawing of a
*     curve.

/*
*+
*  Name:
*     astCvBrk

*  Purpose:
*     Return information about breaks in the last curve drawn by astGridLine,
*     astCurve or astGenCurve.

*  Type:
*     Protected virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     int CvBrk( AstPlot *this, int ibrk, double *brk, double *vbrk,
*                   double *len )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot method.

*  Description:
*     Curves drawn by astGridLine, astCurve or astGenCurve may contain breaks
*     for several reasons (for instance, it may go outside the plotting area,
*     or the mapping between physical and graphics coordinates may be
*     discontinuous). This function returns information about such breaks.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Plot.
*     ibrk
*        The index of the break for which information is required. The first
*        break has index 1. An error is reported if no break with the
*        required index exists. The exception to this is that zero can be
*        supplied, in which case the "brk" and "vbrk" parameters
*        are ignored, but all other information is returned.
*     brk
*        A pointer to an array of 2 elements
*        in which to return the X and Y graphics coordinates of the break.
*     vbrk
*        A pointer to an array of 2 elements
*        in which to return the X and Y components of a unit vector in the
*        graphics coordinate system. The vector is tangential to the curve
*        at the requested break, and points back along the drawn section of
*        the curve.
*     len
*        A pointer to a "double" in which to return the
*        length of the drawn curve, in the graphics coordinate system.

*   Returned Value:
*     astCvBrk()
*        The number of breaks which occurred in the curve.

*  Notes:
*     -  Currently, this function may not be used to return information
*     about curves drawn using astPolyCurve.
*     -  All curves contain at least two breaks; one at the start and one
*     at the end. This is true even if the start and end of the curve are
*     coincident. However, if the entire curve was outside the plotting area
*     (i.e. if the length of the drawn curve is zero), then it will have no
*     breaks.
*     -  If no curve has yet been drawn by astGridLine or astCurve, then -1 is
*     returned for the function value, and the function parameter values are
*     left unchanged.
*     -  The returned information refers to the most recent curve drawn by
*     astGridLine or astCurve, even if that curve was drawn by a Plot other than
*     the one supplied to this function.
*     -  NULL pointers may be supplied for "brk", "vbrk" or "len", in which
*     case the corresponding values are not returned.
*     -  Zero is returned by this function if an error has already occurred,
*     or if this function should fail for any reason.

*     Crv_ylo and Crv_yhi if Crv_clip is non-zero. If the line does not start

c     This function draws a geodesic curve between two points in the
f     This routine draws a geodesic curve between two points in the
*     physical coordinate system of a Plot.  The curve drawn is the
*     path of shortest distance joining the two points (as defined by
c     the astDistance function for the current Frame of the Plot).
f     the AST_DISTANCE function for the current Frame of the Plot).
*     For example, if the current Frame is a basic Frame, then the
*     curve joining the two points will be a straight line in physical
*     coordinate space.  If the current Frame is more specialised and
*     describes, for instance, a sky coordinate system, then the
*     geodesic curve would be a great circle in physical coordinate
*     space passing through the two sky positions given.
*
*     Note that the geodesic curve is transformed into graphical
*     coordinate space for plotting, so that a straight line in
*     physical coordinates may result in a curved line being drawn if
*     the Mapping involved is non-linear. Any discontinuities in the
*     Mapping between physical and graphical coordinates are
c     catered for, as is any clipping established using astClip.
f     catered for, as is any clipping established using AST_CLIP.
*
c     If you need to draw many geodesic curves end-to-end, then the
c     astPolyCurve function is equivalent to repeatedly using
c     astCurve, but will usually be more efficient.
f     If you need to draw many geodesic curves end-to-end, then the
f     AST_POLYCURVE routine is equivalent to repeatedly calling

*  Name:
*     DefGap

*  Purpose:
*     Find default gap sizes for the tick marks on the axes of a 2-D
*     physical coordinate system.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:

*     AstPointSet *DefGap( AstPlot *this, double *gaps, int *ngood,
*                          double *frac, int *inval, const char *method,
*                          const char *class, int *status  )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot method.

*  Description:
*     This function returns default gap sizes for each axis in a 2-D Frame.
*     The values are found by first obtaining a grid of points spread over
*     the region containing good physical coordinates. The physical
*     coordinate values (non-normalized) for each axis are sorted into
*     increasing order.
*
*     For linearly spaced tick marks, a set of quantile axis values is then
*     found, and the median of the gaps between these quantiles is returned
*     as the default gap for the axis.
*
*     For logarithmically spaced tick marks, the returned gap size is the
*     ratio between adjacent tick mark values, chosen to give an optimal
*     number of ticks between the maximum and minimum axis values found in
*     the grid.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Plot.
*     gaps
*        Pointer to an array in which to return the default gap value for
*        each axis.
*     ngood
*        Pointer to an array in which toi return the number of good
*        values in the returned PointSet for each axis.
*     frac
*        Pointer to a double in which to return the fraction of the
*        plotting area containing good physical coordinates.
*     inval
*        Pointer to a location at which to return a flag indicating if
*        any bad physical coordinates were encountered.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to a PointSet holding the physical coordinate values at a
*     set of points spread across the plotting area. The values on each
*     axis are sorted into increasing order. The values will not have
*     been normalized.

*  Notes:
*     -  The returned PointSet should be annulled when no longer needed.
*     -  This function assumes that the physical coordinate system is 2
*     dimensional, and it should not be used if this is not the case.
*     -  Gap sizes of 1.0, zero good points, and a NULL pointer are returned
*     if an error has already occurred, or if this function should fail for
*     any reason.

*  Name:
*     DrawGrid

*  Purpose:

*  Type:

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     AstPlotCurveData **DrawGrid( AstPlot *this, TickInfo **grid, int drawgrid,
*                           const char *method, const char *class )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot method.

*  Description:
*     This function draw a grid of curves at the major tick mark
*     positions on both axes, and returns information describing the
*     breaks in the curves. If short tick marks are required rather
*     than long curves (as specified by the Grid attribute of the supplied
*     Plot), then the curves are not drawn but the break information is
*     still returned.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Plot.
*     grid
*        A pointer to an array of two pointers (one for each axis), each
*        pointing to a TickInfo structure. These describe the positions
*        of the tick marks and should have been produced by function
*        GridLines.
*     drawgrid
*        If non-zero, draw a grid of curves marking the major axis
*        values. Otherwise, tick marks will be drawn at these values later.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to an array of two AstPlotCurveData pointers (one for each axis),
*     each pointing to an array of AstPlotCurveData structures (one for each tick
*     value).

*  Notes:
*     -  This function assumes that the physical coordinate system is 2
*     dimensional, and it should not be used if this is not the case.
*     -  If an error has already occurred, or if this function should fail
*     for any reason, then a NULL pointer is returned.

*  Description:
*     This function displays a character string at a given position
*     using a specified up-vector, optionally interpreting any Plot escape
*     sequences contained within the text. It also returns its bounding
*     box.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The plot.
*     ink
*        If zero, nothing is drawn but the bounding box is still returned.
*     esc
*        Should escape sequences be interpreted? They will be printed
*        literally otherwise.
*     text
*        Pointer to a null-terminated character string to be displayed.
*     x
*        The graphics X coordinate of the label's reference point.
*     y
*        The graphics Y coordinate of the label's reference point.
*     just
*        Pointer to a null-terminated character string identifying the
*        reference point for the text being drawn. The first character in
*        this string identifies the reference position in the "up" direction
*        and may be "M", "B", "C" or "T" (for bottom, baseline, centre or
*        top). The second character identifies the side-to-side reference
*        position and may be "L", "C" or "R" (for left, centre or right). The
*        string is case-insensitive, and only the first two characters are
*        significant.
*     upx
*        The x component of the up-vector for the text. Positive values
*        always refer to displacements from left to right on the screen,
*        even if the graphics x axis increases in the opposite sense.
*     upy
*        The y component of the up-vector for the text. Positive values
*        always refer to displacements from left to right on the screen,
*        even if the graphics y axis increases in the opposite sense.
*     xbn
*        An array in which is returned the x coordinates at the corners
*        of the bounding box. The order is: bottom left, top left, top
*        right, bottom right.
*     ybn
*        An array in which is returned the Y coordinates at the corners
*        of the bounding box (see xbn).
*     drop
*        Address of a float in which to return the distance between the
*        bottom of the bounding box and the baseline of normal text. May
*        be NULL.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Notes:
*     -  The "B" option for the justification in the "up" direction refers
*     to the base-line on which the text is written. Some characters
*     ("y", "p", "g", etc) descend below this line. In addition, if the
*     supplied text string includes any escape sequences which produce
*     sub-scripts, then these will also descend below the base-line. To
*     justify the bottom of the entire string (instead of just the
*     base-line), specify "M" instead of "B" in the justification string.
*     -  See function astFindEscape for details of the supported escape
*     sequences.

/*
*
*  Name:
*     DrawTicks

*  Purpose:
*     Draw tick marks for a 2-D annotated coordinate grid.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     void DrawTicks( AstPlot *this, TickInfo **grid, int drawgrid,
*                     double *labelat, double *gap, const char *method,
*                     const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     This function draws major and minor tick marks. It uses a different
*     technique depending on whether the tick marks are to be put along the
*     edges of the plotting area, or along a curve through the middle of the
*     plotting area. The physical axis values at which to put tick marks
*     are supplied in parameter "grid".
*
*     If the ticks are placed on the edges of the plotting area, The
*     EdgeCrossings function is used to find all points along the edge which
*     have a physical axis value correspoinding to a tick value (there can in
*     general be more than one point on an edge with a given physical axis
*     value). Ticks are put at all such crossings.
*
*     If ticks are placed within the plotting area, then they are put
*     along a curve defined by the "other axis" values supplied in
*     parameter "labelat".

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        A pointer to the Plot.
*     grid
*        A pointer to an array of two TickInfo pointers (one for each axis),
*        each pointing to a TickInfo structure holding information about
*        tick marks on the axis. See function GridLines.
*     drawgrid
*        If non-zero, then a grid of curves has been drawn to mark the
*        major axis values.
*     labelat
*        A pointer to a 2 element array in holding the constant axis
*        values at which tick marks are to be put. Element 0 should hold
*        the axis 1 value at which tick marks for axis 0 are placed. Element
*        1 should hold the axis 0 value at which tick marks for axis
*        1 are placed. If ticks are to be placed round the edges of the
*        plotting zone instead of within the plotting zone, then values of
*        AST__BAD should be supplied.
*     gap
*        Pointer to array of two values holding the gap between major
*        tick marks on the two axes. This will be the difference between,
*        or the ratio of, adjacent tick mark values, depending on the
*        setting of the LogTicks attribute.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function assumes the current Frame of the Plot is 2
*     dimensional, and it should not be called if this is not the case.

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     This function determines how many major tick value labels could be
*     placed on the specified edges of the plotting area, and then if
*     requested, and if sufficient such labels are found (more than 3 on
*     each axis), they are drawn. To place a label on an edge, the curve
*     defining the major tick value must cross the edge at a reasonably
*     angle (at least 3 degrees). Labels are not drawn which would overlap
*     other, previously drawn, labels. A flag is returned indicating if
*     edge labels were (or could be) drawn.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        A pointer to the Plot.
*     ink
*        If zero, then no labels are drawn, but the decision whether or
*        not to draw them is still made and indicated in the returned function
*        value.
*     grid
*        A pointer to an array of two TickInfo pointers (one for each axis),
*        each pointing to a TickInfo structure holding information about
*        tick marks on the axis. See function GridLines.
*     cdata
*        A pointer to an array of two AstPlotCurveData pointers (one for each axis),
*        each pointing to an array of AstPlotCurveData structure (one for each
*        major tick value on the axis), holding information about breaks
*        in the curves drawn to mark the major tick values. See function
*        DrawGrid.
*     force
*        If non-zero, then an attempt is made to draw edge labels even if
*        it looks like insufficient edge labels can be produced.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     If edge labels were drawn, 1 is returned. Otherwise 0 is returned.

*
*  Name:
*     EdgeCrossings

*  Purpose:
*     Find all occurrences of a given physical axis value on an edge of the
*     plotting area.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     int EdgeCrossings( AstPlot *this, int edge, int axis, double axval,
*                        double *gap, double **cross,
*                        EdgeCrossingsStatics **pstatics,
*                        const char *method, const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     This function finds all occurences of a given physical axis value
*     along a specified edge of the plotting area. Firstly, a set of evenly
*     spaced points ("edge samples") are placed along the edge and the
*     corresponding physical coordinates are found. These physical coordinates
*     are then offset slightly from their original positions in the direction
*     of the "other" axis (i.e. index [ 1 - axis ] ), and transformed back
*     into graphics coordinates. These coordinates give the tangent vector
*     at each of the edge samples.
*
*     To find the crossings, the supplied axis value is compared with the axis
*     value at each sample in turn, starting from one end of the edge and
*     working through to the other end. When a crossing is found, linear
*     interpolation is used between the two adjacent edge samples to find a
*     more accurate estimate of the crossing. The vector at the crossing
*     is also estimated by linear interpolation between the vectors at the two
*     adjacent samples.
*
*     This basic algorithm fails if there is a discontinuity in the axis
*     values along the edge. For instance, if the edge covers a range of
*     Right Ascension from 23h to 1h, there will be a discontinuity at 0h
*     at which the RA values suddenly jump from 2*PI to zero. This jump
*     encompasses all normalised RA values and so every axis value would be
*     given a crossing at this point. To avoid this, a bad sample is
*     interposed between the two samples on either side of the
*     discontinuity. This prevents any crossings from being placed at the
*     discontinuity.
*
*     There is a second problem related to discontinuities. If the supplied
*     axis value is zero (using the above RA example again), then no
*     crossings will be found, not only because of the extra bad sample,
*     but also because the samples will not quite cover the range of axis
*     values covered by the discontinuity because of the discrete nature
*     of the samples). To get round this, the sections on either side
*     of the discontinity are extended by a single sample. These extra
*     samples are assumed to be conincident with the neighbouring sample,
*     except that the value for the searched axis is modified to be a
*     linear extension from the neighbouring samples.


*  Parameters:
*     this
*        A pointer to the Plot. Supply a NULL pointer to release resources.
*     edge
*        The edge of the plotting area to be used. Edge 0 is the left hand
*        edge. Edge 1 is the top edge. Edge 2 is the right-hand edge. Edge 3
*        is the bottom edge.
*     axis
*        The index of the axis to which "axval" refers.
*     axval
*        The physical axis value to be searched for.
*     gap
*        Pointer to array of two values holding the gap between major
*        tick marks on the two axes.
*     cross
*        A pointer to the location at which to return a pointer to an
*        array of doubles holding the crossing information. Each crossing
*        is described by 4 doubles. The first pair are the graphiucs (x,y)
*        coordinates of the point on the edge at which the crossing occurs.
*        The second pair represents a unit vector in graphics coordinates
*        which is tangential to the curve of constant axis value at the
*        crossing. The memory allocated within this function to hold this
*        data should be freed using astFree when no longer needed. If no
*        crossings are found a NULL pointer is returned.
*     pstatics
*        Address of a pointer to a structure holding values for variables
*        which were statically defined within this function prior to the
*        thread-safe version of AST. If the pointer is supplied as NULL,
*        then a new structure is allocated and initialised. Any supplied
*        structure is freed if a NULL pointer is supplied for "this".
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Return Value:
*     The number of crossings found.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function allocates static resource on the first invocation
*     which should be freed when no more calls are to be made, by making a
*     final call with a NULL pointer supplied for "this". All other parameters
*     are then ignored.
*     -  The static resources are re-initialised each time "edge" or
*     "axis" changes, and so the calling function should be structure in
*     order to minimise the number of times these parameter values change.
*     -  If an error has already occurred, or if this function should
*     fail for any reason, zero is returned, and a NULL pointer is stored at
*     "cross".

/*
*+
*  Name:
*     astFindEscape

*  Purpose:
*     Check if a string starts with a graphics escape sequence.

*  Type:
*     Protected function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     int astFindEscape( const char *text, int *type, int *value, int *nc )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a flag indiciating if the first character in
*     the supplied string is the start of a graphics escape sequence. If
*     so, the type and associated value (if any) of the escape sequence
*     are returned in "type" and "value", and the number of characters
*     occupied by the escape sequence is returned in "nc". If the
*     supplied text string does not begin with an escape sequence, the
*     number of characters before the first escape sequence is returned in
*     "nc" (the length of the string is returned in "nc" if the string
*     contains no escape sequences).
*
*     This function can be used by grf modules which wish to implement
*     interpretation of escape sequences internally, rather than allowing the
*     Plot class to do the interpretation.

*  Parameters:
*     text
*        Pointer to the string to be checked.
*     type
*        Pointer to a location at which to return the type of escape
*        sequence. Each type is identified by a symbolic constant defined
*        in grf.h. The returned value is undefined if the supplied text
*        does not begin with an escape sequence.
*     value
*        Pointer to a lcation at which to return the integer value
*        associated with the escape sequence. All usable values will be
*        positive. Zero is returned if the escape sequence has no associated
*        integer. A value of -1 indicates that the attribute identified by
*        "type" should be reset to its "normal" value (as established using
*        the astGAttr function, etc). The returned value is undefined if the
*        supplied text does not begin with an escape sequence.
*     nc
*        Pointer to a location at which to return the number of
*        characters read by this call. If the text starts with an escape
*        sequence, the returned value will be the number of characters in
*        the escape sequence. Otherwise, the returned value will be the
*        number of characters prior to the first escape sequence, or the
*        length of the supplied text if no escape sequence is found.

*  Returned Value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if the supplied text starts with a
*     graphics escape sequence, and zero is returned otherwise.

*  Escape Sequences:
*     Escape sequences are introduced into the text string by a percent
*     "%" character. The following escape sequences are currently recognised
*     ("..." represents a string of one or more decimal digits):
*
*       %%      - Print a literal "%" character.
*
*       %^...+  - Draw subsequent characters as super-scripts. The digits
*                 "..." give the distance from the base-line of "normal"
*                 text to the base-line of the super-script text, scaled
*                 so that a value of "100" corresponds to the height of
*                 "normal" text.
*       %^+     - Draw subsequent characters with the normal base-line.
*
*       %v...+  - Draw subsequent characters as sub-scripts. The digits
*                 "..." give the distance from the base-line of "normal"
*                 text to the base-line of the sub-script text, scaled
*                 so that a value of "100" corresponds to the height of
*                 "normal" text.
*
*       %v+     - Draw subsequent characters with the normal base-line
*                 (equivalent to %^+).
*
*       %>...+  - Leave a gap before drawing subsequent characters.
*                 The digits "..." give the size of the gap, scaled
*                 so that a value of "100" corresponds to the height of
*                 "normal" text.
*
*       %<...+  - Move backwards before drawing subsequent characters.
*                 The digits "..." give the size of the movement, scaled
*                 so that a value of "100" corresponds to the height of
*                 "normal" text.
*
*       %s...+  - Change the Size attribute for subsequent characters. The
*                 digits "..." give the new Size as a fraction of the
*                 "normal" Size, scaled so that a value of "100" corresponds
*                 to 1.0;
*
*       %s+     - Reset the Size attribute to its "normal" value.
*
*       %w...+  - Change the Width attribute for subsequent characters. The
*                 digits "..." give the new width as a fraction of the
*                 "normal" Width, scaled so that a value of "100" corresponds
*                 to 1.0;
*
*       %w+     - Reset the Size attribute to its "normal" value.
*
*       %f...+  - Change the Font attribute for subsequent characters. The
*                 digits "..." give the new Font value.
*
*       %f+     - Reset the Font attribute to its "normal" value.
*
*       %c...+  - Change the Colour attribute for subsequent characters. The
*                 digits "..." give the new Colour value.
*
*       %c+     - Reset the Colour attribute to its "normal" value.
*
*       %t...+  - Change the Style attribute for subsequent characters. The
*                 digits "..." give the new Style value.
*
*       %t+     - Reset the Style attribute to its "normal" value.
*
*       %h+     - Remember the current horizontal position (see "%g+")
*
*       %g+     - Go to the horizontal position of the previous "%h+" (if any).
*
*       %-      - Push the current graphics attribute values onto the top of
*                 the stack (see "%+").
*
*       %+      - Pop attributes values of the top the stack (see "%-"). If
*                 the stack is empty, "normal" attribute values are restored.

*  Notes:
*     -  Zero is returned if an error has already occurred.

*  Name:
*     FindMajTicks

*  Purpose:
*     Place the major tick marks for a physical coordinate axis.

*  Type:

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     int FindMajTicks( AstMapping *map, AstFrame *frame, int axis,
*                       double refval, double width, double gap, double *cen, int ngood,
*                       double *data, double **tick_data )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     The caller supplies an array of axis values (non-normalized), sorted
*     into ascending order (with any bad values at the end), together with
*     the gap size for the axis. The array of axis values is assumed to cover
*     the entire range which the axis can take within the plotting zone. The
*     first tick mark is placed just below the smallest axis value, at a
*     position which is an integral number of gaps away from the value
*     supplied in "cen" (if a value of AST__BAD is supplied for "cen" then
*     "cen = 0.0" is assumed). Notionally, tick marks are then placed at
*     intervals given by "gap" all the way upto, and just beyond, the
*     largest axis value. However, it could be that large sections of the
*     axis are not actually present within the plotting zone. For instance,
*     an RA axis covering the two hour range from 23h to 1h (centred on
*     0h), will have some values at zero and some at 23.999.., but there
*     will be a large range inbetween these limits which is not represented
*     in the plotting area (i.e. the 22h range from 1h to 23h centred on
*     12h). For this reason, tick marks are removed if there are no axis
*     values inbetween the tick mark and either of its neighbours. However,
*     small "holes" in the axis coverage are allowed, and ticks marks are
*     returned covering such small holes. Extra tick marks are also placed
*     at each end of the range to guard against the supplied array of axis
*     values not entirely covering the range of axis values in the plotting
*     area.
*
*     For SkyFrames, positions which have latitude values outside the
*     normal ranges are ignored. Longitude ranges are not checked to
*     avoid problems with CAR projections.
*
*     The returned tick mark values are placed into their primary domain
*     using the Norm1 method, but are NOT normalised using the astNorm
*     method for the supplied Frame. Duplicate tick marks values are
*     removed from the returned list.

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        Mapping from the Plot Base Frame to Plot Current Frame.
*     frame
*        Pointer to the Frame.
*     axis
*        Zero-based index of the axis being used.
*     refval
*        Value to use for the other axis (index [1-axis]) when placing
*        the tick mark values into their primary domain.
*     width
*        Range of used values on the other axis (index [1-axis]).
*     gap
*        The supplied value for the gaps between ticks on the axis.
*     cen
*        Pointer to the supplied axis value at which to put a central tick.
*        Other ticks will be placed evenly on either side of this tick. If
*        AST__BAD is provided, a value will be used which would put a tick
*        at an axis value of zero. The used value is returned.
*     ngood
*        The number of good values in the array pointer to by "data" (i.e.
*        values not equal to AST__BAD).
*     data
*        A pointer to an array holding sorted axis values (non-normalized)
*        covering the entire plotting area.
*     tick_data
*        A pointer to a place at which to store a pointer to an array
*        holding the returned tick mark values for the axis.

*  Returned Value:
*     The number of major tick mark values stored in the array pointer to
*     by "*tick_data".

*  Notes:
*     -  If an error has already occurred, or if this function should fail
*     for any reason, then a NULL pointer is returned in "tick_data", and zero
*     is returned for the function value.

*  Name:
*     Fpoly

*  Purpose:
*     Flush all stored poly lines to the graphics system.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     void Fpoly( AstPlot *this, const char *method, const char *class,
*                 int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     This function sends all previously drawn poly lines to the graphics
*     system for rendering, and frees the memory used to hold the poly
*     lines. It attempts to reduce the number of graphics calls by
*     concatenating continuous polylines together.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Plot.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

f     This routine draws a general user-defined curve defined by the
*     supplied Mapping. Note that the curve is transformed into graphical
*     coordinate space for plotting, so that a straight line in

c     map
f     MAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to a Mapping. This Mapping should have 1 input

*        normalized so that the start of the curve is at offset 0.0,

*        does not need to be linearly related to distance along the curve.

*     Labelling in this situation, then the value actually used (i.e.
*     interior) will be returned instead of the requested value (i.e.
*     exterior).
*
*     Some attributes have dynamic defaults, (i.e. the behaviour if not
*     set depends on the values of other attributes). If the value for
*     such an attribute is enquired using this function, then the dynamic
*     default value actually used will be returned if no value has been
*     set explicitly for the attribute.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Plot.
*     attrib
*        Pointer to a null terminated string containing the name of
*        the attribute whose value is required. This name should be in
*        lower case, with all white space removed.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     - Pointer to a null terminated string containing the attribute
*     value.

*  Notes:
*     - The returned string pointer may point at memory allocated
*     within the Plot, or at static memory. The contents of the
*     string may be over-written or the pointer may become invalid
*     following a further invocation of the same function or any
*     modification of the Plot. A copy of the string should
*     therefore be made if necessary.
*     - A NULL pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Purpose:

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     For linearly spaced major ticks the "gap" returned by this function
*     is the constant difference between adjacent major tick marks. For
*     logarithmically spaced major ticks the "gap" returned by this
*     function is the constant ratio between adjacent major tick marks.
*
*     If a gap size has been specified using attribute Gap (or LogGap for
*     logarithmic ticks) supplied, the specified value is returned, and used
*     to determine the tick values. If no gap size is supplied, a default
*     gap size is used and returned.
*
*     All this is over-ridden if the astSetTickValues method has been
*     called to store explicit tick mark values in the Plot structure.
*     In this case, the values supplied using astSetTickValues are
*     returned.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The Plot. Supplying a NULL pointer will cause statics resources
*        to be released.
*     axis
*        The zero-based index of the axis to use.
*     cen
*        Pointer to the supplied axis value at which to put a single
*        central tick. Other ticks will be placed evenly on either side
*        of this tick. If AST__BAD is provided, a value will be used
*        which would put a tick at an axis value of one. The used value
*        is returned.
*     ticks
*        Pointer to a place at which to return a pointer to the memory in
*        which are stored the major tick values to be used. This pointer
*        should be freed using astFree when no longer needed. The number of
*        values in the array is given by the value returned by parameter
*        "nmajor".
*     nmajor
*        A pointer to a location at which to return the number of major
*        ticks.
*     minticks
*        Pointer to a place at which to return a pointer to the memory in
*        which are stored the minor tick values to be used. This pointer
*        should be freed using astFree when no longer needed. The number of
*        values in the array is given by the value returned by parameter
*        "nminor". The minor tick marks values returned in this array are
*        the ones stored in the Plot via a call to the astSetTickValues
*        function. If this function has not been called, then a NULL
*        pointer is returned, and the "nminor" value is returned holding the
*        number of divisions between major ticks.
*     nminor
*        A pointer to a location at which to return either the number of
*        division into which each gap should be divided when drawing minor
*        tick marks (if "*minticks" is returned holding NULL), or the
*        total number of minor tick values stored in "*minticks" (if
*        "*minticks" is returned non-NULL). The number of divisions
*        between major tick values is one more than the number of minor
*        tick marks.
*     format_set
*        Indicates if an explicit format has been set for the axis. If
*        not, "cen" is always assumed to be AST__BAD, and any specified
*        Gap value is rounded to the nearest "nice" value. This has
*        to be done because the algorithm for choosing a format avoiding
*        unnecessary precision only works if the gap size causes 1 digit to
*        change between adjacent labels.
*     inval
*        A pointer to a location at which to return a flag indicating if
*        any invalid physical coordinates were encountered.
*     refval
*        A pointer to a location at which to return a value for the other
*        axis which can be used when normalizing the returned tick mark
*        values.
*     pstatics
*        Address of a pointer to a structure holding static data values
*        used within this function. A NULL pointer should be supplied on
*        the first invocation (dynamic memory will then be allocated to
*        hold ths structure). The memory is freed when a NULL value for
*        "this" is supplied.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     The used gap size.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function allocates some static resources on its first
*     invocation, which should be released when no longer needed, or when
*     a different Plot is supplied, by calling this function with a NULL
*     pointer for parameter "this". All other parameters are ignored.
*     -  This function assumes that the physical coordinate system is 2
*     dimensional, and it should not be used if this is not the case.
*     -  An error is reported if the region containing valid physical
*     coordinates is too small to use.
*     -  If an error has already occurred, or if this function should fail
*     for any reason, then a NULL pointer is returned in "ticks", zero
*     is returned for the number of major and minor ticks marks.

/*
*  Name:
*     GoodGrid

*  Purpose:
*     Create a grid covering the region containing good coordinates in a
*     2-D physical coordinate Frame.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     double GoodGrid( AstPlot *this, int *dim, AstPointSet **pset1,
*                      AstPointSet **pset2, const char *method,
*                      const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     This function creates two PointSets, one holding a square grid of
*     graphics coordinates, and the other holding the corresponding physical
*     coordinates (not normalized). The grid covers just the area containing
*     good physical coordinates. The points are stored row by row in the
*     returned PointSets.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The Plot.
*     dim
*        A pointer to an integer in which to store the number of samples
*        along each edge of the returned grid.
*     pset1
*        A pointer to a location at which to store a pointer to the
*        PointSet holding the graphics coordinates.
*     pset2
*        A pointer to a location at which to store a pointer to the
*        PointSet holding the physical coordinates.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     The fraction of the plotting area containing good physical
*     coordinates.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function assumes that the physical coordinate system is 2
*     dimensional, and it should not be used if this is not the case.
*     -  The returned PointSets should be annulled when no longer needed,
*     using astAnnul.
*     -  An error is reported if the region containing valid physical
*     coordinates is too small to use.
*     -  A function value of zero, and NULL pointers are returned if an error
*     has already occurred, or if this function should fail for any reason.

*  Description:
*     This function fills the supplied array with a square grid of graphics
*     coordinates covering the supplied area. The points are stored row by
*     row, i.e. if the cell size for the grid is (dx,dy), the first point
*     is (xmin,ymin), followed by (xmin+dx,ymin), (xmin+2*dx,ymin), up to
*     (xmin+(dim-1)*dx,ymin), followed by the next row (xmin,ymin+dy),
*     (xmin+dx,ymin+dy), etc.

*  Parameters:
*     dim
*        The number of samples along each edge of the grid.
*     disk
*        If non-zero, the corners of the grid are omitted, resulting in a
*        grid that is more disk like than rectangular.
*     xlo
*        The lower bound on the first axis of the region to be covered
*        by the grid.
*     xhi
*        The upper bound on the first axis of the region to be covered
*        by the grid.
*     ylo
*        The lower bound on the second axis of the region to be covered
*        by the grid.
*     yhi
*        The upper bound on the second axis of the region to be covered
*        by the grid.
*     ptr1
*        A pointer to an array of two pointers giving the start of the two
*        arrays to receive the values for each of the two axes of the graphics
*        coordinate data.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     The number of points in the grid. If "disk" is zero, this will be
*     the square of "dim". If "disk" is non-zero, this will be less than
*     the square of "dim" to account for the lack of corner points.

*        a justification string is "M", then the text should be justified
*        with the given reference point at the bottom of the bounding box.
*        This is different to "B" justification, which requests that the
*        reference point be put on the baseline of the text, since some
*        characters hang down below the baseline. If the "Text" or
*        "TxExt" function cannot differentiate between "M" and "B",
*        then this function should return zero, in which case "M"
*        justification will never be requested by Plot. The supplied
c        "value" argument should be ignored.
f        VALUE argument should be ignored.
*
*        GRF__ESC: This function should return a non-zero value if the
*        "Text" and "TxExt" functions can recognise and interpret
*        graphics escape sequences within the supplied string (see
*        attribute Escape). Zero should be returned if escape sequences
*        cannot be interpreted (in which case the Plot class will interpret
c        them itself if needed). The supplied "value" argument should be
f        them itself if needed). The supplied VALUE argument should be
*        ignored only if escape sequences cannot be interpreted by "Text" and
c        "TxExt". Otherwise, "value" indicates whether "Text" and "TxExt"
c        should interpret escape sequences in subsequent calls. If "value" is
f        "TxExt". Otherwise, VALUE indicates whether "Text" and "TxExt"

c     This function draws a complete annotated set of
f     This routine draws a complete annotated set of
*     coordinate axes for a Plot with (optionally) a coordinate grid
*     superimposed. Details of the axes and grid can be controlled by
*     setting values for the various attributes defined by the Plot
*     class (q.v.).

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Plot.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - If the supplied Plot is a Plot3D, the axes will be annotated
*     using three 2-dimensional Plots, one for each 2D plane in the 3D
*     current coordinate system. The plots will be "pasted" onto 3 faces
*     of the cuboid graphics volume specified when the Plot3D was
*     constructed. The faces to be used can be controlled by the "RootCorner"
*     attribute.
*     - An error results if either the current Frame or the base Frame
*     of the Plot is not 2-dimensional or (for a Plot3D) 3-dimensional.
*     - An error also results if the transformation between the base
*     and current Frames of the Plot is not defined in either
*     direction (i.e. the Plot's TranForward or TranInverse attribute
*     is zero).

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot method.

*  Description:
c     This function draws a curve in the physical coordinate system of
f     This routine draws a curve in the physical coordinate system of
*     a Plot by varying only one of the coordinates along the length
*     of the curve. It is intended for drawing coordinate axes,

c     are also available via the more comprehensive astGrid function).
f     are also available via the more comprehensive AST_GRID routine).
*
*     The curve is transformed into graphical coordinate space for
*     plotting, so that a straight line in physical coordinates may
*     result in a curved line being drawn if the Mapping involved is
*     non-linear. Any discontinuities in the Mapping between physical
*     and graphical coordinates are catered for, as is any

*        Pointer to the Plot.
c     axis
f     AXIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the Plot axis whose physical coordinate value is
*        to be varied along the length of the curve (all other
*        coordinates will remain fixed). This value should lie in the
*        range from 1 to the number of Plot axes (Naxes attribute).
c     start
f     START( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        An array, with one element for each axis of the Plot, giving
*        the physical coordinates of the start of the curve.

*        the selected physical axis. This may be positive or negative.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Notes:
c     - No curve is drawn if the "start" array contains any
c     coordinates with the value AST__BAD, nor if "length" has this value.

   simply use the minimum value on axis "1-j" together with the tick value
   on axis "j" to define the starting position. The length could be taken
   as the difference between the maximum and minimum values on axis "1-j".
   However, this may not be right in some situations. For instance if the
   plotting area covers a small range of Right Ascension from 23:59:59 to
   00:00:01. Using the difference between the maximum and minimum values
   to give the length of the curve would result in the curve starting at
   00:00:00 (the minimum axis value) and extending for a length of 23:59:59
   (the axis range). To get round this sort of problem, the curve is split
   up into sections with lengths and starting positions determined by the
   tick mark values on axis "1-j". The first section starts at the minimum
   axis value and extends upto the first missing tick mark (in the RA
   example, this would be at 00:00:01). Subsequent sections starts at the

*        A pointer to the Plot.
*     id
*        An integer specifying the graphical object to be drawn.
*     set
*        If non-zero then the attributes for the specified object are set
*        to the values indicated by the corresponding Plot attributes,
*        and the current values are saved in a static array. If zero, then
*        the values are set to the values stored in the static array.
*     prim
*        Indicates the sort of graphics primative used to draw the
*        object. This must be one of (defined in grf.h) :

*     #include "plot.h"
*     int GVec( AstPlot *this, AstMapping *mapping, double *phy,
*               int axis, double delta, AstPointSet **pset1,

*               const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     This function returns a unit vector (in the graphics coordinate
*     system) in the positive direction of the specified physical axis,
*     at the given physical position. It works by transforming the given
*     physical position, together with another very close position, and
*     returning the vector between them. It is possible for a
*     discontinuity to occur between these two close positions,
*     resulting in a very large meaningless vector prior to
*     normalisation. For this reason two vectors are found, one joining
*     the given position to a close position higher up the axis, and one
*     joining a close position lower down the axis to the given position.
*     If these two vectors differ in magnitude by a large factor, then
*     the shorter of the two vectors is normalised and returned.
*     Otherwise, the vector which is closest in direction to the vector
*     supplied in [dx,dy] is returned. The returned vector is reversed if
*     necessary so that it always points in the positive direction of the
*     axis.
*
*     If neither of the two vectors can be found (i.e. if the graphics
*     coordinates are bad, or coincident), then the vector supplied in
*     [dx,dy] is returned unchanged, and a function value of zero is
*     returned. Otherwise, a function value of one is returned.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Plot.
*     mapping
*        Pointer to the Mapping from the base Frame of the Plot ot the
*        current Frame.
*     phy
*        Pointer to an array holding the coordinates in the current Frame
*        of the Plot at which the tangent vector is required.
*     axis
*        The index of the axis within the current Frame for which the
*        tangent vector is required.
*     delta
*        The increment in the axis value to use between positions defining
*        the vectors.
*     pset1
*        A pointer to a place at which to store a pointer to a PointSet
*        holding current Frame coordinates. This PointSet pointer should
*        be supplied as NULL on the first call to this function, resulting
*        in a new PointSet being created and a pointer to it returned.
*        Subsequent calls to this function shopuld retain the pointer
*        returned by the first call. The PointSet pointer should be
*        annulled using astAnnul when no longer needed.
*     pset2
*        A pointer to a place at which to store a pointer to a PointSet
*        holding base Frame coordinates. This PointSet is managed in the
*        same way as "pset1".
*     gx
*        A pointer to a double in which to return the graphics X
*        coordinate of the position supplied by "phy".
*     gy
*        A pointer to a double in which to return the graphics Y
*        coordinate of the position supplied by "phy".
*     dx
*        A pointer to a double in which to return the X component
*        of the unit tangent vector. This should be supplied holding a
*        "default" unit vector which is left unchanged if no new vector
*        can be found.
*     dy
*        A pointer to a double in which to return the Y component
*        of the unit tangent vector. This should be supplied holding a
*        "default" unit vector which is left unchanged if no new vector
*        can be found.
*     flag
*        A pointer to an int in which to return a flag indicating which
*        of the two vectors was returned. Zero is returned if the vector
*        was estimated by moving in a positive direction along the axis
*        from the position supplied by "phy". One is returned if the vector
*        was estimated by moving in a negative direction along the axis
*        from the position supplied by "phy" (in this case the returned
*        vector will have been negated so that it refers to the positive
*        direction).
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     One is returned if the vector was found succesfully, Zero is returned
*     if the vector could not be estimated for any reason. No error is
*     reported if the failure was due to the nature of the mapping.

*  Notes:
*     -  If an error has already occurred, or if this function should fail
*     for any reason, then a NULL pointer is returned.

*     "psuedo-identifier" which represents two other genuine identifiers.

*     For instance, if "id" is AST__AXIS1_ID (a genuine id), then *id1 is
*     returned equal to AST__AXIS1_ID and *id2 is returned equal to -1. If
*     "id" is AST__AXES_ID (a pseudo-identifier), then *id1 is returned equal
*     to AST__AXIS1_ID and *id2 is returned equal to AST__AXIS2_ID.

*     Genuine identifiers all have values which are less than the value
*     of AST__NPID. Pseudo-identifiers have values which are greater than
*     or equal to the value of AST__NPID.

*  Parameters:
*     id
*        The supplied identifier (genuine or pseudo).
*     nax
*        The number of axes spanning graphics space (2 or 3).
*     id1
*        Pointer to the int at which to return the first genuine
*        identifier corresponding to "id".
*     id2
*        Pointer to the int at which to return the second genuine
*        identifier corresponding to "id" (or -1 if "id" is a genuine
*        identifier).
*     id3
*        Pointer to the int at which to return the third genuine
*        identifier corresponding to "id" (or -1 if "id" has no third
*        genuine identifier).
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     The number of genuine identifiers corresponding to the supplied
*     (possibly Pseudo-) identifier. This will be in the range 1 to 3.

*  Description:
*     This function modifies the current graphics attributes, the supplied
*     reference position, in preparation for drawing another sub-string
*     from a string containing graphics escape sequences. The type and
*     value of an escape sequence preceding the substring is supplied.
*     Note, this function ignored escape sequences which represent an
*     escaped percent sign. Such escape sequences are drawn as normal
*     text by the claling function.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The plot.
*     type
*        The type of escape sequence. Each type is identified by a symbolic
*        constant defined in grf.h.
*     value
*        The value associated with the escape sequence. All usable values
*        will be positive. A value of -1 shold be supplied if the attribute
*        identified by "type" should be reset to its "normal" value (as
*        established using the astGAttr function, etc).
*     x
*        Pointer to a double holding the x coordinate at the concatenation
*        point. This will be modified on exit if the escape sequence
*        requires it.
*     y
*        Pointer to a double holding the y coordinate at the concatenation
*        point. This will be modified on exit if the escape sequence
*        requires it.
*     ux
*        The x component of the up-vector for the text, in graphics coords.
*        The length of this vector should be equal to the height of normal
*        text drawn with this up-vector.
*     uy
*        The y component of the up-vector for the text. See "ux".
*     rx
*        The x component of the right-vector for the text. The length of this
*        vector should be equal to the height of normal text drawn with the
*        supplied up-vector.
*     ry
*        The y component of the right-vector for the text. see "rx".
*     just
*        The justification being used for each substring.
*     rise
*        Pointer to a float holding the height of the current baseline
*        above the normal baseline, given as a percentage of the height of
*        normal text. May be negative for sub-scripts. May be modified on
*        exit if the escape sequence effects the height of the baseline.
*     nsize
*        The size of normal text.
*     nstyle
*        The style of normal text.
*     nwidth
*        The width of normal text.
*     ncol
*        The colour of normal text.
*     nfont
*        The font of normal text.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Description:
*     This function is used to modify the reference point and justification
*     of a string by converting the vertical "M" justification option (which
*     indicates that the reference point refers to the bottom of the
*     bounding box) into a corresponding "B" option (which indicates that
*     the reference point refers to the text baseline). The reference
*     point is modified accordingly.
*
*     This is only done if the grf module does not support "M"
*     justification. Otherwise, the supplied justification string and
*     reference point coordinates are returned unchanged.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The plot.
*     esc
*        Should escape sequences be interpreted? They will be printed
*        literally otherwise.
*     text
*        Pointer to a null-terminated character string to be displayed.
*     x
*        Pointer to a double holding the x coordinate at the reference
*        point. This is modified on exit if the supplied "just" string
*        indicates that the supplied value refers to the bottom of the
*        bounding box, and the grf module does not support such
*        justification. In this case, the returned value is a point on
*        the baseline of the text which would result in the bottom of
*        the bounding box being at the supplied position.
*     y
*        Pointer to a double holding the y coordinate at the reference
*        point. This is modified on exit if the supplied "just" string
*        indicates that the supplied value refers to the bottom of the
*        bounding box, and the grf module does not support such
*        justification. In this case, the returned value is a point on
*        the baseline of the text which would result in the bottom of
*        the bounding box being at the supplied position.
*     upx
*        The x component of the up-vector for the text. Positive values
*        always refer to displacements from left to right on the screen,
*        even if the graphics x axis increases in the opposite sense.
*     upy
*        The y component of the up-vector for the text. Positive values
*        always refer to displacements from left to right on the screen,
*        even if the graphics y axis increases in the opposite sense.
*     just
*        A character string which specifies the location within the
*        text string which is to be placed at the reference position
*        given by x and y. The first character may be 'T' for "top",
*        'C' for "centre", 'B' for "baseline" or "M" for "bottom", and
*        specifies the vertical location of the reference position. Note,
*        "baseline" corresponds to the base-line of normal text,and "M"
*        corresponds to the bottom of the bounding box. Some characters
*        (eg "y", "g", "p", etc) and sub-scripts descend below the base-line.
*        The second character may be 'L' for "left", 'C' for "centre", or 'R'
*        for "right", and specifies the horizontal location of the
*        reference position. If the string has less than 2 characters
*        then 'C' is used for the missing characters.
*     uxu
*        X component of normalised up-vector, in graphics coords.
*     uyu
*        Y component of normalised up-vector, in graphics coords.
*     rxu
*        X component of normalised right-vector, in graphics coords.
*     ryu
*        Y component of normalised right-vector, in graphics coords.
*     x0
*        Address of a float at which to return the x coordinate at the
*        left end of the baseline of the whole string.
*     y0
*        Address of a float at which to return the y coordinate at the
*        left end of the baseline of the whole string.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to a dynamically allocated string which contains the
*     justification to use in future. This pointer should be freed using
*     astFree when no longer needed. This string will contain a full
*     upper-case justification string which can be used by the current
*     grf module.

*  Notes;
*     - NULL is returned if an error has occurred.

*
*  Name:
*     Labelat

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the other axis value at which to place interior labels
*     and tick marks.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     int Labelat( AstPlot *this, TickInfo **grid, AstPlotCurveData **cdata,
*                  double *labelat, const char *method, const char *class )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     If tick marks and labels are to be placed within the plotting area,
*     the tick values stored in "grid" determine their position on one
*     axis, and their position on the other axis is determined by this
*     function. If a value has been set for the "LabelAt" attribute, then
*     it is used, otherwise the "other axis" value on the longest curve
*     parallel to the "other axis" is used (although the curve "other axis
*     = zero" is used if it passes through the plotting area and is not too
*     short). The effective length assigned to each curve is reduced in
*     proportion to the number of tick marks which are close to the edge
*     of the plotting area.
*
*     A flag is returned indicating if the two axes appear to be
*     independent, in which case there is nothing to be gained by using
*     interior labelling.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        A pointer to the Plot.
*     grid
*        A pointer to an array of two TickInfo pointers (one for each axis),
*        each pointing to a TickInfo structure holding information about
*        tick values on the axis. See function GridLines.
*     cdata
*        A pointer to an array of two AstPlotCurveData pointers (one for each axis),
*        each pointing to an array of AstPlotCurveData structure (one for each
*        major tick value on the axis), holding information about breaks
*        in the curves drawn to mark the major tick values. See function
*        DrawGrid.
*     labelat
*        A pointer to a 2 element array in which to store the constant axis
*        values at which tick marks are put. Element 0 is returned holding
*        the axis 1 value at which tick marks for axis 0 are placed. Element
*        1 is returned holding the axis 0 value at which tick marks for axis
*        1 are placed.
*     flags
*        A pointer to a 2 element array. Each element is a flag which is
*        returned non-zero if the corresponding axis
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     Zero if and only if the lines of constant axis value are all the
*     same length for all tick marks on either axis. If this is so, using
*     interior labelling will not enable any more major ticks to be
*     drawn, and so there is no reason to switch to interior labelling (unless
*     the user has specifically requested interior labelling).

*  Notes:
*     -  This function assumes the current Frame of the Plot is 2
*     dimensional, and it should not be called if this is not the case.

*  Description:

*        in the curves drawn to mark the major tick values. See function
*        DrawGrid.
*     gap
*        Pointer to array of two values holding the gap between major
*        tick values on the two axes.
*     labelat
*        A pointer to a 2 element array holding the constant axis
*        values at which tick marks are put. Element 0 should hold
*        the axis 1 value at which tick marks for axis 0 are placed. Element
*        1 should hold the axis 0 value at which tick marks for axis
*        1 are placed. If labels are to be placed round the edges of the

*     frm
*        A pointer to the Current Frame in the Plot. If this is supplied
*        NULL, then a pointer is found within this function if required (i.e.

*     map
*        The Mapping from graphics to physical coordinates, extracted from
*        the Plot.
*     disk
*        If non-zero, the corners of the grid are omitted form the
*        returned PointSets, resulting in a grid that is more disk like than

*     dim
*        The number of samples along each edge of the grid.
*     xlo
*        The lower bound on the first axis of the region to be covered

*     nphy
*        The number of axes in the physical cooridinate system.
*     pset1
*        A pointer to a location at which to store a pointer to the
*        PointSet holding the graphics coordinates.
*     pset2
*        A pointer to a location at which to store a pointer to the
*        PointSet holding the physical coordinates.
*     norm
*        If non-zero the physical cooridnates are normalised using the
*        Plot's astNorm method.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Notes:
*     - The returned PointSets should be annulled when no longer needed,
*     using astAnnul.
*     -  NULL pointers are returned if an error has already occurred, or

*  Description:
*     This function manages the thread lock on the supplied Object. The

*     these locks are used.

*  Parameters:

*        Pointer to the Object.
*     mode
*        An integer flag indicating what the function should do:
*
*        AST__LOCK: Lock the Object for exclusive use by the calling
*        thread. The "extra" value indicates what should be done if the
*        Object is already locked (wait or report an error - see astLock).
*
*        AST__UNLOCK: Unlock the Object for use by other threads.
*
*        AST__CHECKLOCK: Check that the object is locked for use by the

*     extra
*        Extra mode-specific information.
*     fail
*        If a non-zero function value is returned, a pointer to the

*        returned pointer should not be annulled. A NULL pointer is
*        returned if this function returns a value of zero.
*     status

*  Description:
*     The supplied distances are converted into physical coordinates
*     using the scalings described by various external variables, and then
*     these physical coordinates are mapped into graphics coordinates.

*  Parameters:
*     n
*        The number of points to map. Static resources are released but
*        no points are mapped if zero is supplied.
*     dist
*        A pointer to an array holding "n" distances. A "dist" value of
*        zero corresponds to the starting position supplied in external
*        variable Map1_origin. A "dist" value of one corresponds to the
*        finishing position which is a distance Map1_length away from
*        Map1_origin, moving in the positive direction of the axis given
*        by Map1_axis. "dist" values can be either linearly or
*        logarithmically related to axis values (see Map1_log).
*     x
*        A pointer to an array in which to store the "n" graphics X
*        coordinate values corresponding to the positions in "dist".
*     y
*        A pointer to an array in which to store the "n" graphics Y
*        coordinate values corresponding to the positions in "dist".
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.
*     AST__GLOBALS
*        Only present if compiled with -DTHREAD_SAFE. It is a pointer to
*        the structure holding the global data for the executing thread.
*        It is passed as a function parameter, rather than being accessed
*        within this function using the astGET_GLOBALS(NULL) macro (as
*        other Object-less functions do) in order to avoid the time
*        overheads of calling astGET_GLOBALS(NULL) . This function is
*        time-critical.

*  External Variables:
*     Map1_log = int (Read)
*        If zero, then "dist" in learly related to axis value. Otherwise
*        it is linearly related to log10(axis value).
*     Map1_ncoord = int (Read)
*        The number of axes in the physical coordinate system.
*     Map1_axis = int (Read)
*        The zero-based index of the axis which the curve follows (i.e.
*        the axis which changes value along the curve).
*     Map1_statics = Map1Statics * (Read and Write)
*        Pointer to a structure holding other static data used by Map1.
*     Map1_origin = const double * (Read)
*        A pointer to an array holding the physical coordinate value on
*        each axis at the start of the curve (i.e. at dist = 0.0).
*     Map1_length = double (Read)
*        The scale factor to convert "dist" values into increments
*        along the physical axis given by Map1_axis.
*     Map1_plot = AstPlot * (Read)
*        A pointer to the Plot defining the mapping from graphics cordinates
*        to physical coordinates.
*     Map1_map = AstMapping * (Read)
*        A pointer to the mapping from graphics cordinates to physical
*        coordinates extracted from the Plot.
*     Map1_frame = AstFrame * (Read)
*        A pointer to the Current Frame in the Plot.
*     Map1_norm = int (Read)
*        A flag indicating if physical coordinate values which are not in
*        the normal ranges of the corresponding axes should be considered
*        bad.

*  Notes:
*     -  On the first call, this function allocates static resources which

*     or when no longer needed, by calling this function with "n" supplied as

*  Name:
*     Map3

*  Purpose:
*     Find graphics coordinates at given distances along a geodesic curve
*     between two physical coordinate positions.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     void Map3( int n, double *dist, double *x, double *y,
*                const char *method, const char *class,
*                int *status [,AstGlobals *AST__GLOBALS] )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     The supplied distances are converted into physical offsets along the
*     geodesic curve joining the starting and finishing points given by
*     externals Map3_origin and Map3_end. The physical coordinates at these
*     offsets are found, and transformed into graphics coordinates.

*  Parameters:
*     n
*        The number of points to map. Static resources are released but
*        no points are mapped if zero is supplied.
*     dist
*        A pointer to an array holding "n" distances. A "dist" value of
*        zero corresponds to the starting position supplied in external
*        variable Map3_origin. A "dist" value of one corresponds to the
*        finishing position given by Map3_end.
*     x
*        A pointer to an array in which to store the "n" graphics X
*        coordinate values corresponding to the positions in "dist".
*     y
*        A pointer to an array in which to store the "n" graphics Y
*        coordinate values corresponding to the positions in "dist".
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.
*     AST__GLOBALS
*        Only present if compiled with -DTHREAD_SAFE. It is a pointer to
*        the structure holding the global data for the executing thread.
*        It is passed as a function parameter, rather than being accessed
*        within this function using the astGET_GLOBALS(NULL) macro (as
*        other Object-less functions do) in order to avoid the time
*        overheads of calling astGET_GLOBALS(NULL) . This function is
*        time-critical.

*  External Variables:
*     Map3_ncoord = int (Read)
*        The number of axes in the physical coordinate system.
*     Map3_origin = const double * (Read)
*        A pointer to an array holding the physical coordinate value on
*        each axis at the start of the curve (i.e. at dist = 0.0).
*     Map3_end = const double * (Read)
*        A pointer to an array holding the physical coordinate value on
*        each axis at the end of the curve (i.e. at dist = 1.0).
*     Map3_scale = double (Read)
*        The scale factor to convert "dist" values into physical offsets
*        along the geodesic curve.
*     Map3_statics = Map3Statics * (Read and Write)
*        Pointer to a structure holding other static data used by Map3.
*     Map3_plot = AstPlot * (Read)
*        A pointer to the Plot defining the mapping from graphics cordinates
*        to physical coordinates.
*     Map3_map = AstMapping * (Read)
*        A pointer to the mapping from graphics cordinates to physical
*        coordinates extracted from the Plot.
*     Map3_frame = AstFrame * (Read)
*        A pointer to the Current Frame in the Plot.

*  Notes:
*     -  On the first call, this function allocates static resources which
*     are used by subsequent invocation. These resources should be freed before
*     calling this function with new values for any of the external variables,
*     or when no longer needed, by calling this function with "n" supplied as
*     zero.
*     -  If an error has already occurred, this runction returns without
*     action ,except that if "n" is supplied as zero then static resources
*     are released even if an error has already occurred.

*  Description:
c     This function draws a set of markers (symbols) at positions
f     This routine draws a set of markers (symbols) at positions
*     specified in the physical coordinate system of a Plot. The

*     Use a Mapping to normalize an array of axis values.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     void Norm1( AstMapping *map, int axis, int nv, double *vals,
*                 double refval, double width, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     The normalization of a position in physical space has two parts;
*     firstly, the Mapping may determine a form of normalization;
*     secondly, the Frame may provide an additional normalizion by the
*     astNorm method. This function implements normalization using a
*     Mapping, by transforming the physical position into Graphics position,
*     and then back into a physical position. For instance, if the Mapping
*     represents a mapping of Cartesian graphics axes onto a 2D polar
*     coordinate system, a physical theta value of 3.PI will be normalized by
*     the Mapping into a theta value of 1.PI (probably, but it depends on
*     the Mapping). In this case, the Mapping normalization may well be the
*     only normalization available, since the 2D polar coord. system will
*     probably use a simple Frame to represent the (radius,theta) system,
*     and a simple Frame defines no normalization (i.e. the astNorm method
*     returns the supplied position unchanged).
*
*     Complications arise though because it is not possible to normalise
*     a single axis value - you can only normalize a complete position.
*     Therefore some value must be supplied for the other axis. We
*     should use the LabelAt value, but we do not yet know what the LabelAt
*     value will be. Instead, we try first using the supplied "refval"
*     which should be close to the mode of the other aixs values. Usually
*     the value used is not very important. However, for some complex
*     projections (such as quad-cubes, TSC, etc) the choice can be more
*     critical since some positions on the ksy correspond to undefined
*     graphics positions (e.g the face edges in a TSC projection).
*     Therefore, if the supplied refval results in any positions being
*     undefined we refine the process by transforming the undefined
*     positaons again using a different refval. We do this twice to bump
*     up the likelihood of finding a suitable reference value.

*  Parameters:
*     mapping
*        The Mapping from Graphics Frame to the current Frame.
*     axis
*        The index of the axis for which values are supplied in "vals".
*     nv
*        The number of values supplied in "vals".
*     vals
*        Pointer to an array of axis values. On exit they are normalized.
*     refval
*        The preffered constant value to use for the other axis when
*        normalizing the values in "vals".
*     width
*        The range of used values for the other axis.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

/*
*  Name:
*     Overlap

*  Purpose:
*     See if a major tick value label would overlap any of the previously
*     drawn labels.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     int Overlap( AstPlot *this, int mode, int esc, const char *text, float x,
*                  float y, const char *just, float upx, float upy,
*                  float **work, const char *method, const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     The operation of this function is determined by the "mode" parameter.

*     A record is kept of the bounding boxes enclosing all the displayed
*     labels. If the bounding box of the new label defined by the given
*     parameter values would overlap any of the old bounding boxes, 0 is
*     returned. Otherwise 1 is returned and the bounding box for the new
*     label is added to the list of old bounding boxes.

*     This function also updates the external variables Box_lbnd and
*     Box_ubnd which hold the lower and upper bounds of the area enclosing
*     all used labels.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        A pointer to the Plot.
*     mode
*        - If -1, find the bounding box of the supplied label, add it
*        to the list of stored bounding box, and return 1 if it overlaps
*        any previously stored bounding boxes.
*        - If -2, leave the bounding boxes unchanged and return the
*        number of bounding boxes currently stored. No other action is taken
*        and all other arguments are ignored.
*        - Otherwise, reset the number of stored bounding boxes to the
*        value of mode, and return the new number of bounding boxes. No
*        action is taken if mode is less than zero or greater than the current
*        number of stored boxes. No other action is taken and all other
*        arguments are ignored.
*     esc
*        Should escape sequences in the text be interpreted?
*     text
*        A pointer to the label text string.
*     x
*        The graphics X coordinate of the label's reference point.
*     y
*        The graphics Y coordinate of the label's reference point.
*     just
*        A character string which specifies the location within the
*        text string which is to be placed at the reference position
*        given by x and y. The first character may be 'T' for "top",
*        'C' for "centre", or 'B' for "bottom", and specifies the
*        vertical location of the reference position. The second
*        character may be 'L' for "left", 'C' for "centre", or 'R'
*        for "right", and specifies the horizontal location of the
*        reference position. If the string has less than 2 characters
*        then 'C' is used for the missing characters.
*     upx
*        The x component of the up-vector for the text.
*     upy
*        The y component of the up-vector for the text.
*     work
*        A pointer to a place at which to store a pointer to an array of
*        floats holding the old bounding boxes. Memory to hold this array
*        is allocated automatically within this function. The pointer to
*        the array should be supplied as NULL on the first call to this
*        function, and the array should be freed using astFree when no
*        longer needed.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     See parameter "mode."

*  Notes:
*     -  Zero is returned if an error has occurred, or if this function
*     should fail for any reason.

*++
*  Name:
c     astPolyCurve
f     AST_POLYCURVE

*  Purpose:
*     Draw a series of connected geodesic curves.

*  Type:
*     Public virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "plot.h"
c     void astPolyCurve( AstPlot *this, int npoint, int ncoord, int indim,
c                        const double *in )
f     CALL AST_POLYCURVE( THIS, NPOINT, NCOORD, INDIM, IN, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot method.

*  Description:
c     This function joins a series of points specified in the physical
c     coordinate system of a Plot by drawing a sequence of geodesic
c     curves.  It is equivalent to making repeated use of the astCurve
c     function (q.v.), except that astPolyCurve will generally be more
c     efficient when drawing many geodesic curves end-to-end. A
c     typical application of this might be in drawing contour lines.
f     This routine joins a series of points specified in the physical
f     coordinate system of a Plot by drawing a sequence of geodesic
f     curves.  It is equivalent to making repeated calls to the
f     AST_CURVE routine (q.v.), except that AST_POLYCURVE will
f     generally be more efficient when drawing many geodesic curves
f     end-to-end. A typical application of this might be in drawing
f     contour lines.
*
c     As with astCurve, full account is taken of the Mapping between
c     physical and graphical coordinate systems. This includes any
c     discontinuities and clipping established using astClip.
f     As with AST_CURVE, full account is taken of the Mapping between
f     physical and graphical coordinate systems. This includes any
f     discontinuities and clipping established using AST_CLIP.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Plot.
c     npoint
f     NPOINT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of points between which geodesic curves are to be drawn.
c     ncoord
f     NCOORD = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of coordinates being supplied for each point (i.e.
*        the number of axes in the current Frame of the Plot, as given
*        by its Naxes attribute).
c     indim
f     INDIM = INTEGER (Given)
c        The number of elements along the second dimension of the "in"
f        The number of elements along the first dimension of the IN
*        array (which contains the input coordinates). This value is
*        required so that the coordinate values can be correctly
*        located if they do not entirely fill this array. The value
c        given should not be less than "npoint".
f        given should not be less than NPOINT.
c     in
f     IN( INDIM, NCOORD ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
c        The address of the first element in a 2-dimensional array of shape
c        "[ncoord][indim]" giving the
c        physical coordinates of the points which are to be joined in
c        sequence by geodesic curves. These should be stored such that
c        the value of coordinate number "coord" for point number
c        "point" is found in element "in[coord][point]".
f        A 2-dimensional array giving the physical coordinates of the
f        points which are to be joined in sequence by geodesic
f        curves. These should be stored such that the value of
f        coordinate number COORD for input point number POINT is found
f        in element IN(POINT,COORD).
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - No curve is drawn on either side of any point which has any
*     coordinate equal to the value AST__BAD.
*     - An error results if the base Frame of the Plot is not
*     2-dimensional.
*     - An error also results if the transformation between the
*     current and base Frames of the Plot is not defined (i.e. the
*     Plot's TranInverse attribute is zero).

*     uy
*        The y component of the up-vector for the text. See "ux".

*        Pointer to a double holding a value which gives the position of the
*        left edge of the total bounding box. The value is such that
*        (x0,y0) + beta_lo*(rx,ry) is a point on the left edge of the
*        total bounding box. The returned value is updated so that the

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain a list of tick mark values and labels for a single axis in a 2-D

*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:

*                          const char *method, const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     A set of tick marks values and corresponding formatted labels are
*     found for an axis which result in all adjacent labels being different,
*     but using the minimum number of digits of precision in the formatting.
*     This algorithm is over-ridden if the caller has set an explicit Format
*     string for the axis. The gap between tick marks can be specified by
*     the caller or a default value may be found automatically.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The Plot.
*     axis
*        The zero-based index of the axis to use.
*     cen
*        Pointer to the supplied axis value at which to put a single
*        central tick. Other ticks will be placed evenly on either side of
*        this tick. If AST__BAD is provided, a value will be used which
*        would put a tick at an axis value of zero. The used value is
*        returned.
*     gap
*        The supplied values for the gaps between ticks on the axis. If
*        this is AST__BAD a suitable default value will be used and
*        returned in place of the AST__BAD value.
*     inval
*        A pointer to a location at which to return a flag indicating if
*        any invalid physical coordinates were encountered while deciding on
*        the tick values.
*     pstatics
*        Address of a pointer to a structure holding static data values
*        used within the GetTicks function. A NULL pointer should be supplied
*        on the first invocation (dynamic memory will then be allocated to
*        hold ths structure). The memory is freed when a NULL value for
*        "this" is supplied.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to a TickInfo structure holding information about the tick
*     marks (no. of major and minor ticks, the major tick mark values and
*     labels). This structure should be freed, together with its contents,
*     using astFree when it is no longer needed.

*  Notes:
*     -  The returned labels are NOT abbreviated to remove identical
*     leading fields.
*     -  This function allocates some static resources on its first
*     invocation, which should be released when no longer needed, or when
*     a different Plot is supplied, by calling this function with a NULL
*     pointer for parameter "this". All other parameters (except axis) are
*     ignored.
*     -  This function assumes that the physical coordinate system is 2
*     dimensional, and it should not be used if this is not the case.
*     -  An error is reported if the region containing valid physical
*     coordinates is too small to use.
*     -  If an error has already occurred, or if this function should fail
*     for any reason, then a NULL pointer is returned.

/*
*  Name:
*     TraceBorder

*  Purpose:
*     Trace the boundary between good and bad physical coordinates through a
*     fine grid.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     int TraceBorder( AstPlot *this, AstMapping *map, double xlo, double xhi,
*                      double ylo, double yhi, int dim, double tol,
*                      int edges[ 4 ], const char *method, const char *class,
*                      int *status ) {

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     A rectangular grid of points in graphics coords is created covering
*     the region specified by (xlo,xhi,ylo,yhi), using "dim" points along
*     each axis. This grid of points is converted into physical (WCS)
*     coords, and a flag is associatred with each point saying whether
*     the WCS coords are good or bad. The cells in this grid are then
*     scanned from bottom left to top right in raster fashion (each cell
*     has a grid point at each of its 4 corners). If a cell has a mix of
*     bad and good corners, the good/bad boundary must pass through it.
*     If the grid is sufficiently fine (as defined by "tol") then this
*     function draws a single straight line through each cell as an
*     approximation to the good bad boundary. This line joins the centres
*     of the two cells edges through which the boundary passes (as
*     indicated by the fact that one end of the edge has good WCS coords
*     and the other end has bad WCS coords). If the grid is not
*     sufficiently fine to meet the "tol" requirement, then this function
*     is invoked recursively to draw the curve through each cell through
*     which the boundary passes.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The plot.
*     map
*        The Graphics->WCS mapping.
*     xlo
*        The lower bounds on the graphics X axis of the rectangle being
*        considered.
*     xhi
*        The upper bounds on the graphics X axis of the rectangle being
*        considered.
*     ylo
*        The lower bounds on the graphics Y axis of the rectangle being
*        considered.
*     yhi
*        The upper bounds on the graphics Y axis of the rectangle being
*        considered.
*     dim
*        The number of points along one edge of the fine grid.
*     tol
*        The plotting tolerance. Once each cell is smaller than this
*        distance (in graphics coords), the cell is drawn. Otherwise,
*        this function is invoked recursively to draw the cell using a
*        finer grid.
*     edges
*        A pointer to an array of 4 int, in which will be returned
*        flags indicating if the good/bad boundary intersects any of the
*        edges of the grid. These flags are stored in the order left,
*        top, right, bottom.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Name:
*     Trans

*  Purpose:
*     Use a Mapping to transform a set of points.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     AstPointSet *Trans( AstPlot *this, AstFrame *frm, AstMapping *mapping,
*                         AstPointSet *in, int forward, AstPointSet *out,
*                         int norm, const char *method, const char *class )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot member function.

*  Description:
*     This performs the same task as the protected method astTransform
*     but uses the astTransform method for the supplied Mapping instead
*     the parent method for the Plot. This allows the Mapping to be
*     extracted from the Plot using astGetMapping once, rather than every
*     time a mapping is performed.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Plot (only used to access clipping attributes and
*        other methods).
*     frm
*        Pointer to the Current Frame in the Plot. If this is NULL, then
*        a pointer for the Current Frame is found within this function if
*        required (i.e. if "forward" and "norm" are both non-zero).
*     mapping
*        Pointer to the Mapping extracted from the Plot. If this is NULL, then
*        a pointer for the base->current Mapping is found within this function.
*     in
*        Pointer to the PointSet holding the input coordinate data.
*     forward
*        A non-zero value indicates that the forward coordinate
*        transformation should be applied while a zero value requests the
*        inverse transformation.
*     out
*        Pointer to a PointSet which will hold the transformed (output)
*        coordinate values. A NULL value may also be given, in which case a
*        new PointSet will be created by this function.
*     norm
*        The normalisation of returned physical coordinates is only done
*        if "norm" is non-zero. Otherwise they are left as returned by
*        astTransform.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to the output (possibly new) PointSet.

*  Notes:
*     -  Clipping is only performed as set up using the astClip method.
*     In particular, the clipping specified by the arguments to the astPlot
*     constructor function is NOT performed. This is done in order to improve
*     the efficiency of the curve drawing method astGridLine.
*     -  A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked with the
*     global error status set, or if it should fail for any reason.
*     -  The number of coordinate values per point in the input PointSet must
*     match the number of coordinates for the Plot being applied.
*     -  If an output PointSet is supplied, it must have space for sufficient
*     number of points and coordinate values per point to accommodate the
*     result. Any excess space will be ignored.

/*
*+
*  Name:
*     astPlot

*  Purpose:
*     Create a Plot.

*  Type:
*     Protected function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "plot.h"
*     AstPlot *astPlot( AstFrame *frame, const float *graphbox,
*                       const double *basebox, const char *options, ..., int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot constructor.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new Plot and optionally initialises
*     its attributes.
*
*     The supplied Frame (or the base frame if a FrameSet was supplied) is
*     assumed to be related to the graphics world coordinate system by a
*     simple shift and scale along each axis. The mapping between graphics
*     world coordinates and this Frame is specified by supplying the
*     coordinates in both systems at the bottom left and top right corners
*     of a box on the graphics device. By default, no graphics will be
*     produced outside the supplied box, but this default behaviour can be
*     changed by setting explicit values for the various clipping attributes.

*  Parameters:
*     frame
*        A pointer to a Frame or FrameSet to be annotated. If a NULL pointer
*        is supplied, then a default 2-D Frame will be created to which labels,
*        etc, can be attached by setting the relevant Frame attributes.
*     graphbox
*        A pointer to an array of 4 values giving the graphics world
*        coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of a box on
*        the graphics output device. The first pair of values should be the
*        coordinates of the bottom left corner of the box and the second
*        pair of values should be the coordinates of the top right corner.
*        The horizontal axis should be given first in each pair.
*     basebox
*        A pointer to an array of 4 values giving the coordinates in the
*        supplied Frame, or base frame of the supplied FrameSet, at the
*        bottom left and top right corners of the box specified by parameter
*        graphbox. These should be supplied in the same order as for
*        parameter "graphbox".
*     options
*        Pointer to a null terminated string containing an optional
*        comma-separated list of attribute assignments to be used for
*        initialising the new Plot. The syntax used is the same as
*        for the astSet method and may include "printf" format
*        specifiers identified by "%" symbols in the normal way.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.
*     ...
*        If the "options" string contains "%" format specifiers, then
*        an optional list of arguments may follow it in order to
*        supply values to be substituted for these specifiers. The
*        rules for supplying these are identical to those for the
*        astSet method (and for the C "printf" function).

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Plot.

*  Notes:
*     -  The base Frame of the created Plot corresponds to the graphics world
*     coordinate system, and should not, in general, be changed.
*     -  The current Frame of the created Plot corresponds to the Frame
*     given by parameter "frame". If a FrameSet was supplied then its
*     current Frame becomes the current Frame of the created Plot.
*     - If the supplied Frame, or base Frame if a FrameSet was supplied,
*     has more than 2 axes, then the sub-Frame defined by the first 2 axes
*     is used.
*     -  A NULL pointer will be returned if this function is invoked with the
*     global error status set, or if it should fail for any reason.
*-

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the basic Plot constructor which
*     is available via the protected interface to the Plot class.
*     A public interface is provided by the astPlotId_ function.
*     - Because this function has a variable argument list, it is
*     invoked by a macro that evaluates to a function pointer (not a
*     function invocation) and no checking or casting of arguments is
*     performed before the function is invoked. Because of this, the
*     "frame" parameter is of type (void *) and is converted and
*     validated within the function itself.

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot initialiser.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided for use by class implementations to initialise
*     a new Plot object. It allocates memory (if necessary) to accommodate
*     the Plot plus any additional data associated with the derived class.
*     It then initialises a Plot structure at the start of this memory. If
*     the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a virtual
*     function table for a Plot at the start of the memory passed via the
*     "vtab" parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory in which the Plot is to be created. This
*        must be of sufficient size to accommodate the Plot data
*        (sizeof(Plot)) plus any data used by the derived class. If a value
*        of NULL is given, this function will allocate the memory itself using
*        the "size" parameter to determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the Plot (plus derived class data).
*        This will be used to allocate memory if a value of NULL is given for
*        the "mem" parameter. This value is also stored in the Plot
*        structure, so a valid value must be supplied even if not required for
*        allocating memory.
*     init
*        A logical flag indicating if the Plot's virtual function table is
*        to be initialised. If this value is non-zero, the virtual function
*        table will be initialised by this function.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be associated
*        with the new Plot. If NULL, the vtab associated with this class
*        (Plot) will be used.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which contains
*        the name of the class to which the new object belongs (it is this
*        pointer value that will subsequently be returned by the astGetClass
*        method).
*     frame
*        A pointer to the Frame or Frameset to be annotated.
*     graphbox
*        A pointer to an array of 4 values giving the graphics coordinates
*        of the bottom left and top right corners of a box on the graphics
*        output device. The first pair of values should be the graphics
*        coordinates of the bottom left corner of the box and the second
*        pair of values are the graphics coordinates of the top right corner.
*        The horizontal axis should be given first in each pair.
*     basebox
*        A pointer to an array of 4 values giving the coordinates in the
*        supplied Frame or base Frame of the supplied FrameSet at the bottom
*        left and top right corners of the box specified by parameter graphbox.
*        These should be supplied in the same order as for parameter "graphbox".

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Plot.

*  Notes:
*     - If the supplied Frame, or base Frame if a FrameSet was supplied,
*     has more than 2 axes, then the sub-Frame defined by the first 2 axes
*     is used.
*     -  The current Frame of the supplied FrameSet need not be 2-dimensional.
*     -  A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked with the
*     global error status set, or if it should fail for any reason.

*+
*  Name:
*     astLoadPlot

*  Purpose:
*     Load a Plot.

*  Type:
*     Protected function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "Plot.h"
*     AstPlot *astLoadPlot( void *mem, size_t size,
*                           AstPlotVtab *vtab, const char *name,
*                           AstChannel *channel )

*  Class Membership:
*     Plot loader.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided to load a new Plot using data read
*     from a Channel. It first loads the data used by the parent class
*     (which allocates memory if necessary) and then initialises a
*     Plot structure in this memory, using data read from the input
*     Channel.
*
*     If the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a
*     virtual function table for a Plot at the start of the memory
*     passed via the "vtab" parameter.


*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory into which the Plot is to be
*        loaded.  This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the
*        Plot data (sizeof(Plot)) plus any data used by derived
*        classes. If a value of NULL is given, this function will
*        allocate the memory itself using the "size" parameter to
*        determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the Plot (plus derived class
*        data).  This will be used to allocate memory if a value of
*        NULL is given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also
*        stored in the Plot structure, so a valid value must be
*        supplied even if not required for allocating memory.
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "size" value is ignored
*        and sizeof(AstPlot) is used instead.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be
*        associated with the new Plot. If this is NULL, a pointer
*        to the (static) virtual function table for the Plot class
*        is used instead.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which
*        contains the name of the class to which the new object
*        belongs (it is this pointer value that will subsequently be
*        returned by the astGetClass method).
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "name" value is ignored
*        and a pointer to the string "Plot" is used instead.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Plot.

*  Notes:
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*     associated with a rectangular plotting area in the underlying
*     graphics system. This plotting area is where graphical output
*     appears. It is defined when the Plot is created.
*
*     The current Frame of a Plot describes a "physical" coordinate
*     system, which is the coordinate system in which plotting
*     operations are specified. The results of each plotting operation
*     are automatically transformed into graphical coordinates so as
*     to appear in the plotting area (subject to any clipping which
*     may be in effect).
*
*     Because the Mapping between physical and graphical coordinates
*     may often be non-linear, or even discontinuous, most plotting
*     does not result in simple straight lines. The basic plotting
*     element is therefore not a straight line, but a geodesic curve
c     (see astCurve). A Plot also provides facilities for drawing
c     markers or symbols (astMark), text (astText) and grid lines
c     (astGridLine). It is also possible to draw curvilinear axes with
c     optional coordinate grids (astGrid).
f     (see AST_CURVE). A Plot also provides facilities for drawing
f     markers or symbols (AST_MARK), text (AST_TEXT) and grid lines
f     (AST_GRIDLINE). It is also possible to draw curvilinear axes
f     with optional coordinate grids (AST_GRID).
*     A range of Plot attributes is available to allow precise control
*     over the appearance of graphical output produced by these
c     functions.
f     routines.
*
*     You may select different physical coordinate systems in which to
*     plot (including the native graphical coordinate system itself)
*     by selecting different Frames as the current Frame of a Plot,
*     using its Current attribute.  You may also set up clipping (see
c     astClip) to limit the extent of any plotting you perform, and
f     AST_CLIP) to limit the extent of any plotting you perform, and
*     this may be done in any of the coordinate systems associated
*     with the Plot, not necessarily the one you are plotting in.
*
*     Like any FrameSet, a Plot may also be used as a Frame. In this
*     case, it behaves like its current Frame, which describes the
*     physical coordinate system.
*
*     When used as a Mapping, a Plot describes the inter-relation
*     between graphical coordinates (its base Frame) and physical
*     coordinates (its current Frame).  It differs from a normal
*     FrameSet, however, in that an attempt to transform points which
*     lie in clipped areas of the Plot will result in bad coordinate
*     values (AST__BAD).

*  Parameters:
c     frame
f     FRAME = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to a Frame describing the physical coordinate system
*        in which to plot. A pointer to a FrameSet may also be given,
*        in which case its current Frame will be used to define the
*        physical coordinate system and its base Frame will be mapped
*        on to graphical coordinates (see below).
*
*        If a null Object pointer (AST__NULL) is given, a default
*        2-dimensional Frame will be used to describe the physical
*        coordinate system. Labels, etc. may then be attached to this
*        by setting the appropriate Frame attributes
*        (e.g. Label(axis)) for the Plot.
c     graphbox
f     GRAPHBOX( 4 ) = REAL (Given)
*        An array giving the position and extent of the plotting area
*        (on the plotting surface of the underlying graphics system)
*        in which graphical output is to appear. This must be
*        specified using graphical coordinates appropriate to the
*        underlying graphics system.
*
*        The first pair of values should give the coordinates of the
*        bottom left corner of the plotting area and the second pair
*        should give the coordinates of the top right corner. The
*        coordinate on the horizontal axis should be given first in
*        each pair. Note that the order in which these points are
*        given is important because it defines up, down, left and
*        right for subsequent graphical operations.
c     basebox
f     BASEBOX( 4 ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        An array giving the coordinates of two points in the supplied
*        Frame (or in the base Frame if a FrameSet was supplied) which
*        correspond to the bottom left and top right corners of the
*        plotting area, as specified above. This range of coordinates
*        will be mapped linearly on to the plotting area. The
*        coordinates should be given in the same order as above.
c     options
f     OPTIONS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing an optional
c        comma-separated list of attribute assignments to be used for
c        initialising the new Plot. The syntax used is identical to
c        that for the astSet function and may include "printf" format
c        specifiers identified by "%" symbols in the normal way.
c        If no initialisation is required, a zero-length string may be
c        supplied.
f        A character string containing an optional comma-separated
f        list of attribute assignments to be used for initialising the
f        new Plot. The syntax used is identical to that for the
f        AST_SET routine. If no initialisation is required, a blank
f        value may be supplied.
c     ...
c        If the "options" string contains "%" format specifiers, then
c        an optional list of additional arguments may follow it in
c        order to supply values to be substituted for these
c        specifiers. The rules for supplying these are identical to
c        those for the astSet function (and for the C "printf"
c        function).
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astPlot()
f     AST_PLOT
*        A pointer to the new Plot.

*  Notes:
*     - The base Frame of the returned Plot will be a new Frame which
*     is created by this function to represent the coordinate system
*     of the underlying graphics system (graphical coordinates). It is
*     given a Frame index of 1 within the Plot. The choice of base
*     Frame (Base attribute) should not, in general, be changed once a
*     Plot has been created (although you could use this as a way of
*     moving the plotting area around on the plotting surface).
c     - If a Frame is supplied (via the "frame" pointer), then it
f     - If a Frame is supplied (via the FRAME pointer), then it
*     becomes the current Frame of the new Plot and is given a Frame
*     index of 2.
c     - If a FrameSet is supplied (via the "frame" pointer), then
f     - If a FrameSet is supplied (via the FRAME pointer), then
*     all the Frames within this FrameSet become part of the new Plot
*     (where their Frame indices are increased by 1), with the
*     FrameSet's current Frame becoming the current Frame of the Plot.
*     - If a null Object pointer (AST__NULL) is supplied (via the
c     "frame" pointer), then the returned Plot will contain two
f     FRAME pointer), then the returned Plot will contain two
*     Frames, both created by this function. The base Frame will
*     describe graphics coordinates (as above) and the current Frame
*     will be a basic Frame with no attributes set (this will
*     therefore give default values for such things as the Plot Title
*     and the Label on each axis). Physical coordinates will be mapped
*     linearly on to graphical coordinates.
*     - An error will result if the Frame supplied (or the base Frame
*     if a FrameSet was supplied) is not 2-dimensional.
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.
*--

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the external (public) interface to
*     the astPlot constructor function. It returns an ID value
*     (instead of a true C pointer) to external users, and must be
*     provided because astPlot_ has a variable argument list which
*     cannot be encapsulated in a macro (where this conversion would
*     otherwise occur).
*     - Because no checking or casting of arguments is performed
*     before the function is invoked, the "frame" parameter is of type
*     (void *) and is converted from an ID value to a pointer and
*     validated within the function itself.
*     - The variable argument list also prevents this function from
*     invoking astPlot_ directly, so it must be a
*     re-implementation of it in all respects, except for the
*     conversions between IDs and pointers on input/output of Objects.
