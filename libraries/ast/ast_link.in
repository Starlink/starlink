#  Name:
#     ast_link

#  Purpose:
#     Link a program with the AST library.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This command should be used when building programs which use the AST
#     library, in order to generate the correct arguments to allow the compiler
#     to link your program. The arguments generated are written to standard
#     output but may be substituted into the compiler command line in the
#     standard UNIX way using backward quotes (see below).
#
#     By default, it is assumed that you are building a stand-alone program
#     which does not produce graphical output. However, switches are provided
#     for linking other types of program.

#  Invocation:
#c     cc program.c -L/star/lib `ast_link [switches]` -o program
#f     f77 program.f -L/star/lib `ast_link [switches]` -o program

#  Switches:
#     The following switches may optionally be given to this command to
#     modify its behaviour:
#
#
#     - ``-csla'': Ignored. Provided for backward compatibility only.
#
#     - ``-fsla'': Ignored. Provided for backward compatibility only.
#
#     - ``-ems'': Requests that the program be linked so that error messages
#     produced by the AST library are delivered via the Starlink EMS (Error
#     Message Service) library (Starlink System Note SSN/4). By default,
#     error messages are simply written to standard error.
#
#     - ``-drama'': Requests that the program be linked so that error messages
#     produced by the AST library are delivered via the DRAMA Ers (Error
#     Reporting Service) library. By default, error messages are simply
#     written to standard error.
#
#     - ``-grf'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify which
#     2D graphics system is used to display output from the AST library. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new graphics system yourself and wish to provide your own arguments for
#     linking with it. This switch differs from the other ``grf'' switches in
#     that it assumes that your graphics module implements the complete
#     interface required by the current version of AST. If future versions of
#     AST introduce new functions to the graphics interface, this switch will
#     cause ``unresolved symbol'' errors to occur during linking, warning you
#     that you need to implement new functions in your graphics module. To
#     avoid such errors, you can use one of the other, version-specific,
#     switches in place of the ``-grf'' switch, but these will cause run-time
#     errors to be reported if any AST function is invoked which requires
#     facilities not in the implemented interface.
#
#     - ``-grf_v2.0'': This switch is equivalent to the ``-mygrf'' switch.
#     It indicates that you want to link with your own graphics module
#     which implements the 2D graphics interface required by V2.0 of AST.
#
#     - ``-grf_v3.2'': Indicates that you want to link with your own
#     graphics module which implements the 2D graphics interface required by
#     V3.2 of AST.
#
#     - ``-grf_v5.6'': Indicates that you want to link with your own
#     graphics module which implements the 2D graphics interface required by
#     V5.6 of AST.
#
#     - ``-myerr'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify how
#     error messages produced by the AST library should be delivered. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new error delivery system yourself and wish to provide your own
#     arguments for linking with it.
#
#     - ``-mygrf'': This switch has been superceeded by the ``-grf'' switch,
#     but is retained in order to allow applications to be linked with a
#     graphics module which implements the 2D interface used by AST V2.0. It
#     is equivalent to the ``-grf_v2.0'' switch.
#
#     - ``-pgp'': Requests that the program be linked so that 2D
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     Starlink version of the PGPLOT graphics package (which uses GKS
#     for its output). By default, no 2D graphics package is linked and
#     this will result in an error at run time if AST routines are
#     invoked that attempt to generate graphical output.
#
#     - ``-pgplot'': Requests that the program be linked so that 2D
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via
#     the standard (or ``native'') version of the PGPLOT graphics
#     package. By default, no 2D graphics package is linked and this will
#     result in an error at run time if AST routines are invoked that
#     attempt to generate graphical output.
#
#     - ``-grf3d'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify which
#     3D graphics system is used to display output from the AST library. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new 3D graphics system yourself and wish to provide your own arguments
#     for linking with it.
#
#     - ``-pgp3d'': Requests that the program be linked so that 3D
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     Starlink version of the PGPLOT graphics package (which uses GKS
#     for its output). By default, no 3D graphics package is linked and
#     this will result in an error at run time if AST routines are
#     invoked that attempt to generate graphical output.
#
#     - ``-pgplot3d'': Requests that the program be linked so that 3D
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via
#     the standard (or ``native'') version of the PGPLOT graphics
#     package. By default, no 3D graphics package is linked and this will
#     result in an error at run time if AST routines are invoked that
#     attempt to generate graphical output.

#  ERFA & PAL:
#     The AST distribution includes bundled copies of the ERFA and PAL
#     libraries. These will be used for fundamental positional astronomy
#     calculations unless the "--with-external_pal" option was used when
#     AST was configured. If "--with-external_pal" is used, this script
#     will include "-lpal" in the returned list of linking options, and
#     the user should then ensure that external copies of the PAL and
#     ERFA libraries are available (ERFA functions are used within PAL).

#  Examples:
#c     cc display.c -L/star/lib `ast_link -pgplot` -o display
#c        Compiles and links a C program called ``display'' which uses
#c        the standard version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#c     cc plotit.c -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link -grf` -lgrf -o plotit
#c        Compiles and links a C program ``plotit''. The ``-grf''
#c        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#c        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which
#c        corresponds to the interface required by the current version of AST.
#c        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library
#c        reference.
#c     cc plotit.c -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link -grf_v2.0` -lgrf -o plotit
#c        Compiles and links a C program ``plotit''. The ``-grf_v2.0''
#c        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#c        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which
#c        corresponds to the interface required by version 2.0 of AST.
#c        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library
#c        reference.
#f     f77 display.f -L/star/lib `ast_link -pgplot` -o display
#f        Compiles and links a Fortran program called ``display'' which uses
#f        the standard version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#f     f77 plotit.f -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link -grf` -lgrf -o plotit
#f        Compiles and links a Fortran program ``plotit''. The ``-grf''
#f        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#f        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which
#f        corresponds to the interface required by the current version of AST.
#f        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library
#f        reference.
#f     f77 plotit.f -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link -grf_v2.0` -lgrf -o plotit
#f        Compiles and links a Fortran program ``plotit''. The ``-grf_v2.0''
#f        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#f        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which
#f        corresponds to the interface required by version 2.0 of AST.

#  references made from within a C main program. Typically, these will arise
#  from libraries written in Fortran which the AST library (or the C
#  program) calls.  The value here is worked out by the autoconf macro
