*class++
*  Name:
*     Mapping

*  Purpose:
*     Inter-relate two coordinate systems.

*  Constructor Function:
*     None.

*  Description:
*     This class provides the basic facilities for transforming a set
*     of coordinates (representing "input" points) to give a new set
*     of coordinates (representing "output" points).  It is used to
*     describe the relationship which exists between two different
*     coordinate systems and to implement operations which make use of
*     this (such as transforming coordinates and resampling grids of
*     data).  However, the Mapping class does not have a constructor
*     function of its own, as it is simply a container class for a
*     family of specialised Mappings which implement particular types
*     of coordinate transformation.

*  Inheritance:
*     The Mapping class inherits from the Object class.

*  Attributes:
*     In addition to those attributes common to all Objects, every
*     Mapping also has the following attributes:
*
*     - Invert: Mapping inversion flag
*     - IsLinear: Is the Mapping linear?
*     - IsSimple: Has the Mapping been simplified?
*     - Nin: Number of input coordinates for a Mapping
*     - Nout: Number of output coordinates for a Mapping
*     - Report: Report transformed coordinates?
*     - TranForward: Forward transformation defined?
*     - TranInverse: Inverse transformation defined?

*  Functions:
c     In addition to those functions applicable to all Objects, the
c     following functions may also be applied to all Mappings:

*  History:
*     1-FEB-1996 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     29-FEB-1996 (RFWS):
*        Minor improvements to error messages.
*     15-JUL-1996 (RFWS):
*        Support external interface.
*     13-DEC-1996 (RFWS):
*        Added the astMapMerge method.
*     13-DEC-1996 (RFWS):
*        Added the astSimplify method.
*     27-MAY-1997 (RFWS):
*        Improved the astSimplify method to use astMapMerge to
*        simplify a single Mapping where possible.
*     29-MAY-1998 (RFWS):
*        Added the MapBox method.
*     13-NOV-1998 (RFWS):
*        Made default MapBox convergence accuracy larger (i.e. less
*        accurate).
*     10-DEC-1998 (RFWS):
*        First useful implementation of astResample<X>.
*     16-AUG-1999 (RFWS):
*        Fixed bug in SpecialBounds - wrong number of coordinates being used
*        when checking for bad output coordinate values.
*     17-AUG-1999 (RFWS):
*        Improved the convergence security of MapBox (return to older but
*        less efficient setting).
*     24-NOV-2000 (MBT):
*        Fixed bug (function being invoked as wrong type) in AST__UINTERP
*        scheme, and added new AST__BLOCKAVE scheme, in astResample<X>.
*     9-JAN-2001 (DSB):
*        Changed in and out arguments for TranN from type "double (*)[]"
*        to "double *".
*     8-JAN-2003 (DSB):
*        Changed private InitVtab method to protected astInitMappingVtab
*        method.
*     10-JUL-2003 (DSB):
*        Added method astRate.
*     2-SEP-2004 (DSB):
*        Free resources before leaving astRate.
*     31-AUG-2004 (DSB):
*        Make the LinearApprox function protected rather than private,
*        rename it to astLinearApprox, and make the bounds parameters of
*        type double rather than int. Also, correct the size of the fit
*        coefficient array (was "(nin+1)*nout", now is "(nout+1)*nin").
*        Also correct the index of the first gradient coefficient from
*        "fit+nout" to "fit+nin". These errors have probably never been
*        noticed because they make no difference if nin=nout, which is
*        usually the case.
*     6-SEP-2004 (DSB):
*        Make astRate more robust by adding checks for unusal conditions.
*     20-SEP-2004 (DSB):
*        Make the LinearApprox function public and change its interface
*        to be more appropriate for public use. This involved swapping the
*        direction of the fit (the original astLinearApprox fitted the
*        inverse transformation, but the public version now fits the forwrd
*        transformation).
*     4-OCT-2004 (DSB):
*        Modify astMapList to return flag indicating presence of inverted
*        CmpMaps in supplied Mapping.
*     9-NOV-2004 (DSB):
*        Override astEqual method.
*     6-DEC-2004 (DSB):
*        Remove the second derivative estimate from the astRate function
*        since CmpMap has trouble calculating it.
*     17-DEC-2004 (DSB):
*        Added astMapSplit
*     22-APR-2005 (DSB):
*        Modified SpecialBounds to handle cases where some irrelevant
*        output always produces bad values (e.g. a PermMap may do this).
*     30-JUN-2005 (DSB):
*        Added astRebin.
*     7-JUL-2005 (DSB):
*        Make MapSplit public rather than protected.
*     11-AUG-2005 (DSB):
*        Added the AST__CONSERVEFLUX flag (used by astResampleX).
*     17-AUG-2005 (DSB):
*        Added the AST__SOMBCOS kernel.
*     31-AUG-2005 (DSB):
*        Added astRebinSeq.
*     9-SEP-2005 (DSB):
*        Corrected axis indices returned by public interface for astMapSplit.
*     31-JAN-2006 (DSB):
*        Added IsSimple attribute.
*     2-FEB-2006 (DSB):
*        Corrections to prologue of astLinearApprox.
*     16-FEB-2006 (DSB):
*        Some speed optimisations to rebinning code.
*     2-MAR-2006 (DSB):
*        Use HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE in place of AST_LONG_DOUBLE
*     7-MAR-2006 (DSB):
*        Added astTranGrid.
*     14-MAR-2006 (DSB):
*        - The constructor no longer reports an error if the resulting
*	 Mapping cannot transform points in either direction. This is
*	 because it may be possible to simplify such a Mapping and the
*	 simplified Mapping may have defined transformations. E.g. if a
*	 Mapping which has only a forward transformation is combined in
*	 series with its own inverse, the combination CmpMap will simplify
*        to a UnitMap (usually).
*        - Reset the "issimple" flag when the Invert flag is changed.
*     9-MAY-2006 (DSB):
*        Correct upper bounds for idim in RebinWithblocking. Also, remove
*        the single precision "F" instantiation of the MAKE_REBINSEQ macro.
*        Also correct the "nout = astGetNin" line in the MAKE_REBINSEQ
*        macro to "nout = astGetNout".
*     12-MAY-2006 (DSB):
*        Modify SpecialBounds to include points slightly inside the
*        corners. This is because some Mappings may have singularies at
*        the the edges.
*     17-MAY-2006 (DSB):
*        Correct the "nout = astGetNin" line in the MAKE_RESAMPLE
*        and MAKE_REBIN macros to "nout = astGetNout".
*     7-JUL-2006 (DSB):
*        Change -CHAR_MAX value (used as a "not set" value for boolean
*        attributes) to +CHAR_MAX, since some compilers do not allow
*        chars to have negative values.
*     23-AUG-2006 (DSB):
*        Change the Equal function so that it reports an error when
*        called, rather than using astSimplify to determine if two Mappings
*        are equal. All concrete Mapping classes should now provide
*        their own implementation of astEqual, avoiding the use of
*        astSimplify. This is so that astSimplify can use astEqual safely
*        (i.e. without danger of entering an infinite loop).
*     24-NOV-2006 (DSB):
*        Allow astRebinSeq to be called with a NULL pointer for the input
*        data array.
*     14-MAR-2007 (DSB):
*        Modify astRebinSeq to allow input variances to be used as weights.
*     19-MAR-2007 (DSB):
*        Fix bug in LINEAR_2D macro that caused bad input pixel values to be
*        treated as good.
*     16-APR-2007 (DSB):
*        Account for reduction in number of degrees of freedom when
*        calculating output variances on the basis of spread of input values in
*        astReinSeq.
*     28-APR-2007 (DSB):
*        Correct code within Rebin... and Resample... functions that provides
*        optimal handling for 1- and 2- dimensional mappings. Previously, the
*        check for whether or not to use these optimisations was based only on
*        the dimensionality of either input (Rebin) or output (Resample). This
*        could cause the optimised code to be used at inappropriate times,
*        leading to an incorrect effective Mapping between input and output. The
*        checks now check both input and output dimensionality in all cases.
*     3-MAY-2007 (DSB):
*        An extra parameter ("nused") has been added to astRebinSeq, and
*        all the rebinning stuff has been modified to keep "nused" up to date.
*        This is needed to correct a fault in the generation of GENVAR
*        variances.
*     12-DEC-2007 (DSB):
*        Some rebinning kernels (e.g. SINCSINC) have negative values and
*        can result in overall negative output weights. Therefore do not
*        set output pixels with negative weights bad.
*     6-MAR-2008 (DSB):
*        Add an option for astResample to leave unchanged any output pixels
*        for which an interpolated value cannot be obtained. This is
*        controlled by the new AST__NOBAD flag.
*     7-MAY-2008 (DSB):
*        Clarified meaning of AST__GENVAR, AST__USEVAR and AST__VARWGT flags
*        in astRebinSeq.
*     9-MAY-2008 (DSB):
*        Prevent memory over-run in RebinSeq<X>.
*     5-MAY-2009 (DSB):
*        Added astRemoveRegions.
*     11-NOV-2009 (DSB):
*        In astRebinSeq initialise "*nused" to zero (as documented) if the
*        AST__REBININIT flag is supplied.
*     17-NOV-2009 (DSB):
*        Added AST_DISVAR flag for use with astRebinSeq.
*     15-DEC-2009 (DSB):
*        Ensure that all axes span at least one pixel when calling
*        astLinearApprox.
*     18-DEC-2009 (DSB):
*        When using a 1D spreading kernel (in astRebin(Seq)), if the kernel
*        is not contained completely within the output array, reflect the
*        section of the kernel that falls outside the output array back into
*        the output array so that no flux is lost. Also discovered that the
*        n-D code (i.e. the KERNEL_ND macro) incorrectly uses the first
*        user-supplied parameter as the full kernel width rather than the
*        half-width. This has been fixed.
*     26-FEB-2010 (DSB):
*        Add astQuadApprox.
*     27-FEB-2010 (DSB):
*        - Make astQuadApprox faster, and fix a bug in the calculation of
*        the matrix.
*     7-JUN-2010 (DSB):
*        In the KERNEL_<x>D rebinning macros, correct the test for the
*        central point being outside the bounds of the output image.
*     13-AUG-2010 (DSB):
*        In astRebinSeq<X>, scale WLIM to take account of weighting by
*        input variances.
*     13-DEC-2010 (DSB):
*        Ensure that astMapSplit returns a Mapping that is independent of
*        the supplied Mapping (i.e. return a deep copy). This means that
*        subsequent changes to the supplied Mapping cannot affect the returned
*        Mapping.
*     10-FEB-2011 (DSB):
*        When rebinning (in macros NEAR_1/2/ND, KERNEL_1/2/ND, LINEAR_1/2/ND),
*        do not treat a zero variance as bad unless the reciprocals of the
*        variances are being used as weights.
*     16-JUN-2011 (DSB):
*        Allow a check for NaNs to be performed as a debugging tool after
*        every invocation of astTransform. This is controlled by the
*        AST_REPLACE_NAN environment variable: if unset, no check is
*        performed, if set to "1" NaNs are changed to AST__BAD but no
*        error is reported, if set to anything else NaNs are changed to
*        AST__BAD and an error is reported.
*     6-JUL-2012 (DSB):
*        The astRebinSeq<X> family was normalising the returned data and
*        variances values incorrectly, when the AST__REBINEND flag was
*        supplied. The exact size of the error depended on the nature of
*        the Mapping and the spreading method, and so is hard to predict.
*     20-JUL-2012 (DSB):
*        Major re-structuring of astRebinSeq<X> to add further
*        corrections to the normalisation. The model is now that each
*        input array is first rebinned and then scaled to preserve the
*        total data sum, and then each final output pixel is the weighed
*        mean of all the aligned rebinned  pixels.
*     13-AUG-2012 (DSB):
*        Added AST__NONORM flag for asstRebuinSeq<X>.
*     30-AUG_2012 (DSB):
*        Added AST__CONSERVEFLUX flag for astRebinSeq<X>.
*     10-SEP-2012 (DSB):
*        Cater for Mappings that have different numbers of inputs and
*        outputs when finding the flux conservation factor within
*        astRebinSeq and astResample.
*     1-OCT-2012 (DSB):
*        Ensure astRebinSeq<X> does not create any negative output
*        variances.
*     2-OCT-2012 (DSB):
*        - Check for Infs as well as NaNs.
*        - In Rate, break out of the loop if the RMS is very small, not
*          just if it is exactly zero.
*     5-OCT-2012 (DSB):
*        Complete re-write of Rate. It's now much simpler, faster and
*        more reliable.
*     16-OCT-2012 (DSB):
*        In MatrixDet, ignore rows/columns filled with AST_BAD as well as
*        rows/columns filled with zeros.
*     26-APR-2013 (DSB):
*        Change the "nused" parameter of astRebinSeq<X> from "int *" to
*        "size_t *" to allow greater amounts of data to be pasted into
*        the output array.
*     29-APR-2013 (DSB):
*        No sot simplify Mappings that have a set value for their Ident
*        attribute. If an Ident value has been set then it means that we
*        should be trying to preserve the identify of the Mapping. This
*        is implemented via a new protected method (astDoNotSimplify) which
*        is overridden by the Frame class so that this restriction applies
*        only to genuine Mappings, not Frames.
*     9-MAY-2013 (DSB):
*        Change the "nused" parameter of astRebinSeq<X> from "size_t *" to
*        "int64_t *" to cater for systems where "size_t" is only 32 bits long.
*     20-MAY-2013 (DSB):
*        Always perform a linear fit in RebinAdaptively if flux
*        conservation is requested.
*     18-JUL-2013 (DSB):
*        Correct logic for determining whether to divide or not in
*        RebinAdaptively. The old logic could lead to infinite recursion.

*                           <Xtype> *out_var )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This is a set of functions which scale the supplied resampled data
*     values by the given flux conservation factor. It also scales any
*     variances by the square of the factor.

*  Parameters:
*     factor
*        The flux conservation factor. This should be the ratio of the
*        output pixel size to the input pixel size, in the locality of
*        the supplied data values.
*     npoint
*        The number of points at which the input grid was resampled.
*     offset
*        Pointer to an array of integers with "npoint" elements. For
*        each output point, this array should contain the zero-based
*        offset in the output array(s) (i.e. the "out" and,
*        optionally, the "out_var" arrays) at which the resampled
*        output value(s) is stored.
*     badval
*        This parameter specifies the value which is used to identify
*        bad data and/or variance values in the output array(s).
*     out
*        Pointer to an array in which the resampled data is supplied. Note
*        that details of how the output grid maps on to this array
*        (e.g. the storage order, number of dimensions, etc.) is
*        arbitrary and is specified entirely by means of the "offset"
*        array. The "out" array should therefore contain sufficient
*        elements to accommodate the "offset" values supplied.  There
*        is no requirement that all elements of the "out" array should
*        be assigned values, and any which are not addressed by the
*        contents of the "offset" array will be left unchanged.
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, in which variance estimates for
*        the resampled values are supplied. If no output variance estimates
*        are available, a NULL pointer should be given.

*  Notes:
*     - There is a separate function for each numerical type of
*     gridded data, distinguished by replacing the <X> in the function
*     name by the appropriate 1- or 2-character suffix.

*  Name:

*  Purpose:
*     Decompose a Mapping into two component Mappings.

*  Type:
*     Protected virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "mapping.h"
*     void astDecompose( AstMapping *this, AstMapping **map1,
*                        AstMapping **map2, int *series, int *invert1,
*                        int *invert2  )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping method.

*  Description:
*     This function returns pointers to two Mappings which, when applied
*     either in series or parallel, are equivalent to the supplied Mapping.
*
*     Since the Frame class inherits from the Mapping class, Frames can
*     be considered as special types of Mappings and so this method can
*     be used to decompose CmpMaps, CmpFrames, CmpRegions or Prisms.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Mapping.
*     map1
*        Address of a location to receive a pointer to first component
*        Mapping.
*     map2
*        Address of a location to receive a pointer to second component
*        Mapping.
*     series
*        Address of a location to receive a value indicating if the
*        component Mappings are applied in series or parallel. A non-zero
*        value means that the supplied Mapping is equivalent to applying map1
*        followed by map2 in series. A zero value means that the supplied
*        Mapping is equivalent to applying map1 to the lower numbered axes
*        and map2 to the higher numbered axes, in parallel.
*     invert1
*        The value of the Invert attribute to be used with map1.
*     invert2
*        The value of the Invert attribute to be used with map2.

*  Applicability:

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     Some algorithms which use use the astRate method do not actually need

*     a border it evaluates the GRAPHICS->Current Mapping hundreds of time.
*     If the Mapping includes a RateMap then this can be very very slow
*     (depending on how the astRate method is implemented). In fact the
*     border drawing algorithm onlyneeds to know if the result is bad or
*     not - the actual value produced by the Mappign does not matter.
*
*     Such algorithms can be speeded up by forcing the astRate method to
*     return a constant value rather than actually doing the numerical
*     differentiation. This can be accomplised by calling this method prior
*     to implementing the algorithm. It should be called at the end in
*     order to re-instate the original disabled flag.

*
*     The implementation provided by this class (the base Mapping class)
*     simply reports an error when called, since all concrete Mapping
*     subclasses should provide their own implementation.
*
*     Note, sub-class implementations should not use astSimplify (e.g.
*     combining the two Mapping and then simplifying it), since the
*     astSimplify method for certain classes (e.g. CmpMap) may use
*     astEqual. Consequently, if astEqual called astSimplify, there would
*     be possibilities for infinite loops.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the first Object (a Mapping).
*     that
*        Pointer to the second Object.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     One if the Frames are equivalent, zero otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     - The two Mappings are considered equivalent if the combination of
*     the first in series with the inverse of the second simplifies to a
*     UnitMap.
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked

/*
*  Name:
*     GlobalBounds

*  Purpose:
*     Estimate global coordinate bounds for a Mapping.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "mapping.h"
*     void GlobalBounds( MapData *mapdata, double *lbnd, double *ubnd,
*                        double xl[], double xu[], int *status );

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This function estimates the global lower and upper bounds of a
*     Mapping function within a constrained region of its input
*     coordinate space. It uses a robust global optimisation algorithm
*     based on the selection of pseudo-random starting positions,
*     followed by the location of local minima and maxima using the
*     downhill (or uphill) simplex method. The algorithm will cope
*     with the case where there are several competing minima (or
*     maxima) with nearly equal values. It attempts to locate the
*     global bounds to full machine precision when possible.

*  Parameters:
*     mapdata
*        Pointer to a MapData structure describing the Mapping
*        function, its coordinate constraints, etc.
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to a double.  On entry, this should contain a
*        previously-obtained upper limit on the global lower bound, or
*        AST__BAD if no such limit is available. On exit, it will be
*        updated with a new estimate of the global lower bound, if a
*        better one has been found.
*     ubnd
*        Pointer to a double.  On entry, this should contain a
*        previously-obtained lower limit on the global upper bound, or
*        AST__BAD if no such limit is available. On exit, it will be
*        updated with a new estimate of the global upper bound, if a
*        better one has been found.
*     xl
*        Pointer to an array of double, with one element for each
*        input coordinate. On entry, if *lbnd is not equal to AST__OK,
*        this should contain the input coordinates of a point at which
*        the Mapping function takes the value *lbnd. On exit, this
*        function returns the position of a (not necessarily unique)
*        input point at which the Mapping function takes the value of
*        the new global lower bound.  This array is not altered if an
*        improved estimate of the global lower bound cannot be found.
*     xu
*        Pointer to an array of double, with one element for each
*        input coordinate. On entry, if *ubnd is not equal to AST__OK,
*        this should contain the input coordinates of a point at which
*        the Mapping function takes the value *ubnd. On exit, this
*        function returns the position of a (not necessarily unique)
*        input point at which the Mapping function takes the value of
*        the new global upper bound.  This array is not altered if an
*        improved estimate of the global upper bound cannot be found.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Notes:
*     - The efficiency of this function will usually be improved if
*     previously-obtained estimates of the extrema and their locations
*     are provided.
*     - The values returned via "lbnd", "ubnd", "xl" and "xu" will be
*     set to the value AST__BAD if this function should fail for any
*     reason. Their initial values on entry will not be altered if the
*     function is invoked with the global error status set.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This is a set of functions which resample a rectangular input
*     grid of data (and, optionally, associated statistical variance
*     values) so as to place them into a new output grid. Each output
*     grid point may be mapped on to a position in the input grid in
*     an arbitrary way. The input and output grids may have any number
*     of dimensions, not necessarily equal.
*
*     Where the positions given do not correspond with a pixel centre
*     in the input grid, interpolation is performed using a weighted
*     sum of the surrounding pixel values. The weights are determined
*     by a separable kernel which is the product of a 1-dimensional
*     kernel function evaluated along each input dimension. A pointer
*     should be supplied to the 1-dimensional kernel function to be
*     used.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Mapping being used in the resampling operation
*        (this is only used for constructing error messages).
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
*        (i'th) dimension being ubnd_in[i]-lbnd_in[i]+1 (assuming "i"
*        is zero-based). They also define the input grid's coordinate
*        system, with each pixel being of unit extent along each
*        dimension with integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the array of data to be resampled (with an element
*        for each pixel in the input grid). The numerical type of
*        these data should match the function used, as given by the
*        suffix on the function name. The storage order should be such
*        that the index of the first grid dimension varies most
*        rapidly and that of the final dimension least rapidly
*        (i.e. Fortran array storage order).
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and type as the "in" array), which
*        represent estimates of the statistical variance associated
*        with each element of the "in" array. If this second array is
*        given (along with the corresponding "out_var" array), then
*        estimates of the variance of the resampled data will also be
*        returned.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     npoint
*        The number of points at which the input grid is to be
*        resampled.
*     offset
*        Pointer to an array of integers with "npoint" elements. For
*        each output point, this array should contain the zero-based
*        offset in the output array(s) (i.e. the "out" and,
*        optionally, the "out_var" arrays) at which the resampled
*        output value(s) should be stored.
*     coords
*        An array of pointers to double, with "ndim_in"
*        elements. Element "coords[coord]" should point at the first
*        element of an array of double (with "npoint" elements) which
*        contains the values of coordinate number "coord" for each
*        interpolation point. The value of coordinate number "coord"
*        for interpolation point number "point" is therefore given by
*        "coords[coord][point]" (assuming both indices to be
*        zero-based).  If any point has a coordinate value of AST__BAD
*        associated with it, then the corresponding output data (and
*        variance) will be set to the value given by "badval" (unles the
*        AST__NOBAD flag is specified).
*     kernel
*        Pointer to the 1-dimensional kernel function to be used.
*     fkernel
*        Pointer to the 1-dimensional kernel function to be used with no
*        trailing status argument. This is only used if "kernel" is NULL.
*     neighb
*        The number of neighbouring pixels in each dimension (on each
*        side of the interpolation position) which are to contribute
*        to the interpolated value. This value should be at least 1.
*     params
*        Pointer to an optional array of parameter values to be passed
*        to the interpolation kernel function. If no parameters are
*        required by this function, then a NULL pointer may be
*        supplied.
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which provide
*        additional control over the resampling operation.
*     badval
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set in the "flags" value (above),
*        this parameter specifies the value which is used to identify
*        bad data and/or variance values in the input array(s). Its
*        numerical type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. Unles the AST__NOBAD flag is specified in "flags", the
*        same value will also be used to flag any output array elements
*        for which resampled values could not be obtained.  The output
*        arrays(s) may be flagged with this value whether or not the
*        AST__USEBAD flag is set (the function return value indicates
*        whether any such values have been produced).
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the resampled data will be returned. Note
*        that details of how the output grid maps on to this array
*        (e.g. the storage order, number of dimensions, etc.) is
*        arbitrary and is specified entirely by means of the "offset"
*        array. The "out" array should therefore contain sufficient
*        elements to accommodate the "offset" values supplied.  There
*        is no requirement that all elements of the "out" array should
*        be assigned values, and any which are not addressed by the
*        contents of the "offset" array will be left unchanged.
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the resampled values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given. It is addressed in
*        exactly the same way (via the "offset" array) as the "out"
*        array. The values returned are estimates of the statistical
*        variance of the corresponding values in the "out" array, on
*        the assumption that all errors in input grid values (in the
*        "in" array) are statistically independent and that their
*        variance estimates (in the "in_var" array) may simply be
*        summed (with appropriate weighting factors).
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.

*  Returned Value:
*     The number of output grid points for which no valid output value
*     could be obtained.

*  Notes:
*     - There is a separate function for each numerical type of
*     gridded data, distinguished by replacing the <X> in the function
*     name by the appropriate 1- or 2-character suffix.
*     - A value of zero will be returned if any of these functions is
*     invoked with the global error status set, or if it should fail
*     for any reason.

/*
*  Name:
*     InterpolateLinear<X>

*  Purpose:
*     Resample a data grid, using the linear interpolation scheme.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "mapping.h"
*     int InterpolateLinear<X>( int ndim_in,
*                               const int *lbnd_in, const int *ubnd_in,
*                               const <Xtype> *in, const <Xtype> *in_var,
*                               int npoint, const int *offset,
*                               const double *const *coords,
*                               int flags, <Xtype> badval,
*                               <Xtype> *out, <Xtype> *out_var )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This is a set of functions which resample a rectangular input
*     grid of data (and, optionally, associated statistical variance
*     values) so as to place them into a new output grid. Each output
*     grid point may be mapped on to a position in the input grid in
*     an arbitrary way. Where the positions given do not correspond
*     with a pixel centre in the input grid, the interpolation scheme
*     used is linear interpolation between the centres of the nearest
*     neighbouring pixels in each dimension (there are 2 nearest
*     neighbours in 1 dimension, 4 in 2 dimensions, 8 in 3 dimensions,
*     etc.).

*  Parameters:
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
*        (i'th) dimension being ubnd_in[i]-lbnd_in[i]+1 (assuming "i"
*        is zero-based). They also define the input grid's coordinate
*        system, with each pixel being of unit extent along each
*        dimension with integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the array of data to be resampled (with an element
*        for each pixel in the input grid). The numerical type of
*        these data should match the function used, as given by the
*        suffix on the function name. The storage order should be such
*        that the index of the first grid dimension varies most
*        rapidly and that of the final dimension least rapidly
*        (i.e. Fortran array storage order).
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and type as the "in" array), which
*        represent estimates of the statistical variance associated
*        with each element of the "in" array. If this second array is
*        given (along with the corresponding "out_var" array), then
*        estimates of the variance of the resampled data will also be
*        returned.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     npoint
*        The number of points at which the input grid is to be
*        resampled.
*     offset
*        Pointer to an array of integers with "npoint" elements. For
*        each output point, this array should contain the zero-based
*        offset in the output array(s) (i.e. the "out" and,
*        optionally, the "out_var" arrays) at which the resampled
*        output value(s) should be stored.
*     coords
*        An array of pointers to double, with "ndim_in"
*        elements. Element "coords[coord]" should point at the first
*        element of an array of double (with "npoint" elements) which
*        contains the values of coordinate number "coord" for each
*        interpolation point. The value of coordinate number "coord"
*        for interpolation point number "point" is therefore given by
*        "coords[coord][point]" (assuming both indices to be
*        zero-based).  If any point has a coordinate value of AST__BAD
*        associated with it, then the corresponding output data (and
*        variance) will be set to the value given by "badval" (unles the
*        AST__NOBAD flag is specified).
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which control the
*        operation of the function. Currently, only the flag
*        AST__USEBAD is significant and indicates whether there are
*        "bad" (i.e. missing) data in the input array(s) which must be
*        recognised and propagated to the output array(s).  If this
*        flag is not set, all input values are treated literally.
*     badval
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set in the "flags" value (above),
*        this parameter specifies the value which is used to identify
*        bad data and/or variance values in the input array(s). Its
*        numerical type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. Unles the AST__NOBAD flag is specified in "flags", the
*        same value will also be used to flag any output array elements
*        for which resampled values could not be obtained.  The output
*        arrays(s) may be flagged with this value whether or not the
*        AST__USEBAD flag is set (the function return value indicates
*        whether any such values have been produced).
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the resampled data will be returned. Note
*        that details of how the output grid maps on to this array
*        (e.g. the storage order, number of dimensions, etc.) is
*        arbitrary and is specified entirely by means of the "offset"
*        array. The "out" array should therefore contain sufficient
*        elements to accommodate the "offset" values supplied.  There
*        is no requirement that all elements of the "out" array should
*        be assigned values, and any which are not addressed by the
*        contents of the "offset" array will be left unchanged.
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the resampled values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given. It is addressed in
*        exactly the same way (via the "offset" array) as the "out"
*        array. The values returned are estimates of the statistical
*        variance of the corresponding values in the "out" array, on
*        the assumption that all errors in input grid values (in the
*        "in" array) are statistically independent and that their
*        variance estimates (in the "in_var" array) may simply be
*        summed (with appropriate weighting factors).
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.

*  Returned Value:
*     The number of output grid points to which a data value (or a
*     variance value if relevant) equal to "badval" has been assigned
*     because no valid output value could be obtained.

*  Notes:
*     - There is a separate function for each numerical type of
*     gridded data, distinguished by replacing the <X> in the function
*     name by the appropriate 1- or 2-character suffix.
*     - A value of zero will be returned if any of these functions is
*     invoked with the global error status set, or if it should fail
*     for any reason.

/*
*  Name:
*     InterpolateNearest<X>

*  Purpose:
*     Resample a data grid, using the nearest-pixel interpolation scheme.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "mapping.h"
*     int InterpolateNearest<X>( int ndim_in,
*                                const int *lbnd_in, const int *ubnd_in,
*                                const <Xtype> *in, const <Xtype> *in_var,
*                                int npoint, const int *offset,
*                                const double *const *coords,
*                                int flags, <Xtype> badval,
*                                <Xtype> *out, <Xtype> *out_var )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This is a set of functions which resample a rectangular input
*     grid of data (and, optionally, associated statistical variance
*     values) so as to place them into a new output grid. Each output
*     grid point may be mapped on to a position in the input grid in
*     an arbitrary way. Where the positions given do not correspond
*     with a pixel centre in the input grid, the interpolation scheme
*     used is simply to select the nearest pixel (i.e. the one whose
*     bounds contain the supplied position).

*  Parameters:
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
*        (i'th) dimension being ubnd_in[i]-lbnd_in[i]+1 (assuming "i"
*        is zero-based). They also define the input grid's coordinate
*        system, with each pixel being of unit extent along each
*        dimension with integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the array of data to be resampled (with an element
*        for each pixel in the input grid). The numerical type of
*        these data should match the function used, as given by the
*        suffix on the function name. The storage order should be such
*        that the index of the first grid dimension varies most
*        rapidly and that of the final dimension least rapidly
*        (i.e. Fortran array storage order).
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and type as the "in" array), which
*        represent estimates of the statistical variance associated
*        with each element of the "in" array. If this second array is
*        given (along with the corresponding "out_var" array), then
*        estimates of the variance of the resampled data will also be
*        returned.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     npoint
*        The number of points at which the input grid is to be
*        resampled.
*     offset
*        Pointer to an array of integers with "npoint" elements. For
*        each output point, this array should contain the zero-based
*        offset in the output array(s) (i.e. the "out" and,
*        optionally, the "out_var" arrays) at which the resampled
*        output value(s) should be stored.
*     coords
*        An array of pointers to double, with "ndim_in"
*        elements. Element "coords[coord]" should point at the first
*        element of an array of double (with "npoint" elements) which
*        contains the values of coordinate number "coord" for each
*        interpolation point. The value of coordinate number "coord"
*        for interpolation point number "point" is therefore given by
*        "coords[coord][point]" (assuming both indices to be
*        zero-based).  If any point has a coordinate value of AST__BAD
*        associated with it, then the corresponding output data (and
*        variance) will be set to the value given by "badval" (unles the
*        AST__NOBAD flag is specified).
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which control the
*        operation of the function. Currently, only the flag
*        AST__USEBAD is significant and indicates whether there are
*        "bad" (i.e. missing) data in the input array(s) which must be
*        recognised and propagated to the output array(s).  If this
*        flag is not set, all input values are treated literally.
*     badval
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set in the "flags" value (above),
*        this parameter specifies the value which is used to identify
*        bad data and/or variance values in the input array(s). Its
*        numerical type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. Unles the AST__NOBAD flag is specified in "flags", the
*        same value will also be used to flag any output array elements
*        for which resampled values could not be obtained.  The output
*        arrays(s) may be flagged with this value whether or not the
*        AST__USEBAD flag is set (the function return value indicates
*        whether any such values have been produced).
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the resampled data will be returned. Note
*        that details of how the output grid maps on to this array
*        (e.g. the storage order, number of dimensions, etc.) is
*        arbitrary and is specified entirely by means of the "offset"
*        array. The "out" array should therefore contain sufficient
*        elements to accommodate the "offset" values supplied.  There
*        is no requirement that all elements of the "out" array should
*        be assigned values, and any which are not addressed by the
*        contents of the "offset" array will be left unchanged.
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the resampled values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given. It is addressed in
*        exactly the same way (via the "offset" array) as the "out"
*        array. The values returned are estimates of the statistical
*        variance of the corresponding values in the "out" array, on
*        the assumption that all errors in input grid values (in the
*        "in" array) are statistically independent and that their
*        variance estimates (in the "in_var" array) may simply be
*        summed (with appropriate weighting factors).
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.

*  Returned Value:
*     The number of output grid points to which a data value (or a
*     variance value if relevant) equal to "badval" has been assigned
*     because no valid output value could be obtained.

*  Notes:
*     - There is a separate function for each numerical type of
*     gridded data, distinguished by replacing the <X> in the function
*     name by the appropriate 1- or 2-character suffix.
*     - A value of zero will be returned if any of these functions is
*     invoked with the global error status set, or if it should fail
*     for any reason.

*  Name:

*     void InterpolateBlockAverage<X>( int ndim_in,
*                                      const int lbnd_in[],

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This is a set of functions which resample a rectangular input
*     grid of data (and, optionally, associated statistical variance
*     values) so as to place them into a new output grid. To generate
*     an output grid pixel, a block average is taken over an ndim-
*     dimensional hypercube of pixels in the input grid.  If variances
*     are being used then the input pixels will be weighted according
*     to the reciprocals of the corresponding variance values, and
*     input pixels without a valid variance will be ignored;
*     otherwise an unweighted average will be taken over
*     all non-bad pixels in the cube.  The size of the cube over which
*     the average is taken is determined by the first element of the
*     params array.
*
*     This "interpolation" scheme is appropriate where an input grid
*     is to be resampled onto a much coarser output grid.

*  Parameters:
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
*        (i'th) dimension being ubnd_in[i]-lbnd_in[i]+1 (assuming "i"
*        is zero-based). They also define the input grid's coordinate
*        system, with each pixel being of unit extent along each
*        dimension with integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the array of data to be resampled (with an element
*        for each pixel in the input grid). The numerical type of
*        these data should match the function used, as given by the
*        suffix on the function name. The storage order should be such
*        that the index of the first grid dimension varies most
*        rapidly and that of the final dimension least rapidly
*        (i.e. Fortran array storage order).
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and type as the "in" array), which
*        represent estimates of the statistical variance associated
*        with each element of the "in" array. If this second array is
*        given (along with the corresponding "out_var" array), then
*        estimates of the variance of the resampled data will also be
*        returned.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     npoint
*        The number of points at which the input grid is to be
*        resampled.
*     offset
*        Pointer to an array of integers with "npoint" elements. For
*        each output point, this array should contain the zero-based
*        offset in the output array(s) (i.e. the "out" and,
*        optionally, the "out_var" arrays) at which the resampled
*        output value(s) should be stored.
*     coords
*        An array of pointers to double, with "ndim_in"
*        elements. Element "coords[coord]" should point at the first
*        element of an array of double (with "npoint" elements) which
*        contains the values of coordinate number "coord" for each
*        interpolation point. The value of coordinate number "coord"
*        for interpolation point number "point" is therefore given by
*        "coords[coord][point]" (assuming both indices to be
*        zero-based).  If any point has a coordinate value of AST__BAD
*        associated with it, then the corresponding output data (and
*        variance) will be set to the value given by "badval" (unles the
*        AST__NOBAD flag is specified).
*     params
*        A pointer to an array of doubles giving further information
*        about how the resampling is to proceed.  Only the first
*        element is significant; the nearest integer to this gives
*        the number of pixels on either side of the central input
*        grid pixel to use in each dimension.  Therefore
*        (1 + 2*params[0])**ndim_in pixels will be averaged over to
*        generate each output pixel.
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which control the
*        operation of the function. Currently, only the flag
*        AST__USEBAD is significant and indicates whether there are
*        "bad" (i.e. missing) data in the input array(s) which must be
*        recognised and propagated to the output array(s).  If this
*        flag is not set, all input values are treated literally.
*     badval
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set in the "flags" value (above),
*        this parameter specifies the value which is used to identify
*        bad data and/or variance values in the input array(s). Its
*        numerical type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. Unles the AST__NOBAD flag is specified in "flags", the
*        same value will also be used to flag any output array elements
*        for which resampled values could not be obtained.  The output
*        arrays(s) may be flagged with this value whether or not the
*        AST__USEBAD flag is set (the function return value indicates
*        whether any such values have been produced).
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the resampled data will be returned. Note
*        that details of how the output grid maps on to this array
*        (e.g. the storage order, number of dimensions, etc.) is
*        arbitrary and is specified entirely by means of the "offset"
*        array. The "out" array should therefore contain sufficient
*        elements to accommodate the "offset" values supplied.  There
*        is no requirement that all elements of the "out" array should
*        be assigned values, and any which are not addressed by the
*        contents of the "offset" array will be left unchanged.
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the resampled values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given. It is addressed in
*        exactly the same way (via the "offset" array) as the "out"
*        array. The values returned are estimates of the statistical
*        variance of the corresponding values in the "out" array, on
*        the assumption that all errors in input grid values (in the
*        "in" array) are statistically independent and that their
*        variance estimates (in the "in_var" array) may simply be
*        summed (with appropriate weighting factors).
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.
*     nbad
*        Pointer to an int in which to return the number of
*        interpolation points at which an output data value (and/or a
*        variance value if relevant) equal to "badval" has been
*        assigned because no valid interpolated value could be
*        obtained.  The maximum value that will be returned is
*        "npoint" and the minimum is zero (indicating that all output
*        values were successfully obtained).

*  Notes:
*     - There is a separate function for each numerical type of
*     gridded data, distinguished by replacing the <X> in the function
*     name by the appropriate 1- or 2-character suffix.

/*
*++
*  Name:
c     astLinearApprox
f     AST_LINEARAPPROX

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain a linear approximation to a Mapping, if appropriate.

*  Type:
*     Public virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "mapping.h"
c     int astLinearApprox( AstMapping *this, const double *lbnd,
c                          const double *ubnd, double tol, double *fit )
f     RESULT = AST_LINEARAPPROX( THIS, LBND, UBND, TOL, FIT, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping function.

*  Description:
*     This function tests the forward coordinate transformation
*     implemented by a Mapping over a given range of input coordinates. If
*     the transformation is found to be linear to a specified level of
*     accuracy, then an array of fit coefficients is returned. These
*     may be used to implement a linear approximation to the Mapping's
*     forward transformation within the specified range of output coordinates.
*     If the transformation is not sufficiently linear, no coefficients
*     are returned.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Mapping.
c     lbnd
f     LBND( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of doubles
f        An array
*        containing the lower bounds of a box defined within the input
*        coordinate system of the Mapping. The number of elements in this
*        array should equal the value of the Mapping's Nin attribute. This
*        box should specify the region over which linearity is required.
c     ubnd
f     UBND( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of doubles
f        An array
*        containing the upper bounds of the box specifying the region over
*        which linearity is required.
c     tol
f     TOL = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The maximum permitted deviation from linearity, expressed as
*        a positive Cartesian displacement in the output coordinate
*        space of the Mapping. If a linear fit to the forward
*        transformation of the Mapping deviates from the true transformation
*        by more than this amount at any point which is tested, then no fit
*        coefficients will be returned.
c     fit
f     FIT( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
c        Pointer to an array of doubles
f        An array
*        in which to return the co-efficients of the linear
*        approximation to the specified transformation. This array should
*        have at least "( Nin + 1 ) * Nout", elements. The first Nout elements
*        hold the constant offsets for the transformation outputs. The
*        remaining elements hold the gradients. So if the Mapping has 2 inputs
*        and 3 outputs the linear approximation to the forward transformation
*        is:
*
c           X_out = fit[0] + fit[3]*X_in + fit[4]*Y_in
f           X_out = fit(1) + fit(4)*X_in + fit(5)*Y_in
*
c           Y_out = fit[1] + fit[5]*X_in + fit[6]*Y_in
f           Y_out = fit(2) + fit(6)*X_in + fit(7)*Y_in
*
c           Z_out = fit[2] + fit[7]*X_in + fit[8]*Y_in
f           Z_out = fit(3) + fit(8)*X_in + fit(9)*Y_in
*
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astLinearApprox()
f     AST_LINEARAPPROX = LOGICAL
*        If the forward transformation is sufficiently linear,
c        a non-zero value is returned. Otherwise zero is returned
f        .TRUE is returned. Otherwise .FALSE. is returned
*        and the fit co-efficients are set to AST__BAD.

*  Notes:
*     - This function fits the Mapping's forward transformation. To fit
*     the inverse transformation, the Mapping should be inverted using
c     astInvert
f     AST_INVERT
*     before invoking this function.
c     - A value of zero
f     - A value of .FALSE.
*     will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.
*--

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     Sub-classes which implement linear mappings should probably
*     over-ride this function to get better accuracy and faster execution,
*     but currently they do not.

*  Description:

*        Pointer to a MapData structure describing the Mapping
*        function, its coordinate constraints, etc.
*     acc
*        The required accuracy with which the maximum is to be found.
*     fract
*        A value between 0.0 and 1.0 which determines the initial step
*        length along each coordinate axis. It should be given as a
*        fraction of the difference between the upper and lower
*        constraint values for each axis (as specified in the
*        "mapdata" structure).
*     x
*        Pointer to an array of double containing the coordinates of
*        an initial estimate of the position of the maximum. On exit,
*        this will be updated to contain the best estimate of the
*        maximum's position, as found by this function.

*                     double xl[], double xu[] );

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping method.

*  Description:
*     This function allows you to find the "bounding box" which just
*     encloses another box after it has been transformed by a Mapping
*     (using either its forward or inverse transformation). A typical
*     use might be to calculate the size which an image would have
*     after being transformed by the Mapping.
*
*     The function works on one dimension at a time. When supplied
*     with the lower and upper bounds of a rectangular region (box) of
*     input coordinate space, it finds the lowest and highest values
*     taken by a nominated output coordinate within that
*     region. Optionally, it also returns the input coordinates where
*     these bounding values are attained. It should be used repeatedly
*     if the extent of the bounding box is required in more than one
*     dimension.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Mapping.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of double, with one element for each
*        Mapping input coordinate. This should contain the lower bound
*        of the input box in each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of double, with one element for each
*        Mapping input coordinate. This should contain the upper bound
*        of the input box in each dimension.
*
*        Note that it is permissible for the lower bound to exceed the
*        corresponding upper bound, as the values will simply be
*        swapped before use.
*     forward
*        If this value is non-zero, then the Mapping's forward
*        transformation will be used to transform the input
*        box. Otherwise, its inverse transformation will be used.
*
*        (If the inverse transformation is selected, then references
*        to "input" and "output" coordinates in this description
*        should be transposed. For example, the size of the "lbnd_in"
*        and "ubnd_in" arrays should match the number of output
*        coordinates, as given by the Mapping's Nout attribute.)
*     coord_out
*        The (zero-based) index of the output coordinate for which the
*        lower and upper bounds are required.
*     lbnd_out
*        Pointer to a double in which to return the lowest value taken
*        by the nominated output coordinate within the specified
*        region of input coordinate space.
*     ubnd_out
*        Pointer to a double in which to return the highest value
*        taken by the nominated output coordinate within the specified
*        region of input coordinate space.
*     xl
*        An optional pointer to an array of double, with one element
*        for each Mapping input coordinate. If given, this array will
*        be filled with the coordinates of an input point (although
*        not necessarily a unique one) for which the nominated output
*        coordinate takes the lower bound value returned in
*        "*lbnd_out".
*
*        If these coordinates are not required, a NULL pointer may be
*        supplied.
*     xu
*        An optional pointer to an array of double, with one element
*        for each Mapping input coordinate. If given, this array will
*        be filled with the coordinates of an input point (although
*        not necessarily a unique one) for which the nominated output
*        coordinate takes the upper bound value returned in
*        "*ubnd_out".
*
*        If these coordinates are not required, a NULL pointer may be
*        supplied.

*  Notes:
*     - Any input points which are transformed by the Mapping to give
*     output coordinates containing the value AST__BAD are regarded as
*     invalid and are ignored, They will make no contribution to
*     determining the output bounds, even although the nominated
*     output coordinate might still have a valid value at such points.
*     - An error will occur if the required output bounds cannot be
*     found. Typically, this might occur if all the input points which
*     the function considers turn out to be invalid (see above). The
*     number of points considered before generating such an error is
*     quite large, however, so this is unlikely to occur by accident
*     unless valid points are restricted to a very small subset of the
*     input coordinate space.
*     - The values returned via "lbnd_out", "ubnd_out", "xl" and "xu"
*     will be set to the value AST__BAD if this function should fail
*     for any reason. Their initial values on entry will not be
*     altered if the function is invoked with the global error status
*     set.
*-

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the basic astMapBox method available
*     via the protected interface to the Mapping class. The public
*     interface to this method is provided by the astMapBoxId_
*     function.

*                      AstMapping ***map_list, int **invert_list )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping method.

*  Description:
*     This function decomposes a Mapping (which, in derived classes,
*     may be a compound Mapping) into a sequence of simpler Mappings
*     which may be applied in sequence to achieve the same effect. The
*     Mapping is decomposed as far as possible, but it is not
*     guaranteed that this will necessarily yield any more than one
*     Mapping, which may actually be the original one supplied.
*
*     This function is provided to support both the simplification of
*     compound Mappings, and the analysis of Mapping structure so that
*     particular forms can be recognised.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Mapping to be decomposed (the Mapping is not
*        actually modified by this function).
*     series
*        If this value is non-zero, an attempt will be made to
*        decompose the Mapping into a sequence of equivalent Mappings
*        which can be applied in series (i.e. one after the other). If
*        it is zero, the decomposition will instead yield Mappings
*        which can be applied in parallel (i.e. on successive sub-sets
*        of the input/output coordinates).
*     invert
*        The value to which the Mapping's Invert attribute is to be
*        (notionally) set before performing the
*        decomposition. Normally, the value supplied here will be the
*        actual Invert value obtained from the Mapping (e.g. using
*        astGetInvert).  Sometimes, however, when a Mapping is
*        encapsulated within another structure, that structure may
*        retain an Invert value (in order to prevent external
*        interference) which should be used instead.
*
*        Note that the actual Invert value of the Mapping supplied is
*        not used (or modified) by this function.
*     nmap
*        The address of an int which holds a count of the number of
*        individual Mappings in the decomposition. On entry, this
*        should count the number of Mappings already in the
*        "*map_list" array (below). On exit, it is updated to include
*        any new Mappings appended by this function.
*     map_list
*        Address of a pointer to an array of Mapping pointers. On
*        entry, this array pointer should either be NULL (if no
*        Mappings have yet been obtained) or should point at a
*        dynamically allocated array containing Mapping pointers
*        ("*nmap" in number) which have been obtained from a previous
*        invocation of this function.
*
*        On exit, the dynamic array will be enlarged to contain any
*        new Mapping pointers that result from the decomposition
*        requested. These pointers will be appended to any previously
*        present, and the array pointer will be updated as necessary
*        to refer to the enlarged array (any space released by the
*        original array will be freed automatically).
*
*        The new Mapping pointers returned will identify a sequence of
*        Mappings which, when applied in order, will perform a forward
*        transformation equivalent to that of the original Mapping
*        (after its Invert flag has first been set to the value
*        requested above). The Mappings should be applied in series or
*        in parallel according to the type of decomposition requested.
*
*        All the Mapping pointers returned by this function should be
*        annulled by the caller, using astAnnul, when no longer
*        required. The dynamic array holding these pointers should
*        also be freed, using astFree.
*     invert_list
*        Address of a pointer to an array of int. On entry, this array
*        pointer should either be NULL (if no Mappings have yet been
*        obtained) or should point at a dynamically allocated array
*        containing Invert attribute values ("*nmap" in number) which
*        have been obtained from a previous invocation of this
*        function.
*
*        On exit, the dynamic array will be enlarged to contain any
*        new Invert attribute values that result from the
*        decomposition requested. These values will be appended to any
*        previously present, and the array pointer will be updated as
*        necessary to refer to the enlarged array (any space released
*        by the original array will be freed automatically).
*
*        The new Invert values returned identify the values which must
*        be assigned to the Invert attributes of the corresponding
*        Mappings (whose pointers are in the "*map_list" array) before
*        they are applied. Note that these values may differ from the
*        actual Invert attribute values of these Mappings, which are
*        not relevant.
*
*        The dynamic array holding these values should be freed by the
*        caller, using astFree, when no longer required.

*  Returned Value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if the supplied Mapping contained any
*     inverted CmpMaps.

*  Notes:
*     - It is unspecified to what extent the original Mapping and the
*     individual (decomposed) Mappings are
*     inter-dependent. Consequently, the individual Mappings cannot be
*     modified without risking modification of the original.
*     - If this function is invoked with the global error status set,
*     or if it should fail for any reason, then the *nmap value, the
*     list of Mapping pointers and the list of Invert values will all
*     be returned unchanged.

*                      AstMapping ***map_list, int **invert_list )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping method.

*  Description:
*     This function attempts to simplify a sequence of Mappings by
*     merging a nominated Mapping in the sequence with its neighbours,
*     so as to shorten the sequence if possible.
*
*     In many cases, simplification will not be possible and the
*     function will return -1 to indicate this, without further
*     action.
*
*     In most cases of interest, however, this function will either
*     attempt to replace the nominated Mapping with one which it
*     considers simpler, or to merge it with the Mappings which
*     immediately precede it or follow it in the sequence (both will
*     normally be considered). This is sufficient to ensure the
*     eventual simplification of most Mapping sequences by repeated
*     application of this function.
*
*     In some cases, the function may attempt more elaborate
*     simplification, involving any number of other Mappings in the
*     sequence. It is not restricted in the type or scope of
*     simplification it may perform, but will normally only attempt
*     elaborate simplification in cases where a more straightforward
*     approach is not adequate.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the nominated Mapping which is to be merged with
*        its neighbours. This should be a cloned copy of the Mapping
*        pointer contained in the array element "(*map_list)[where]"
*        (see below). This pointer will not be annulled, and the
*        Mapping it identifies will not be modified by this function.
*     where
*        Index in the "*map_list" array (below) at which the pointer
*        to the nominated Mapping resides.
*     series
*        A non-zero value indicates that the sequence of Mappings to
*        be simplified will be applied in series (i.e. one after the
*        other), whereas a zero value indicates that they will be
*        applied in parallel (i.e. on successive sub-sets of the
*        input/output coordinates).
*     nmap
*        Address of an int which counts the number of Mappings in the
*        sequence. On entry this should be set to the initial number
*        of Mappings. On exit it will be updated to record the number
*        of Mappings remaining after simplification.
*     map_list
*        Address of a pointer to a dynamically allocated array of
*        Mapping pointers (produced, for example, by the astMapList
*        method) which identifies the sequence of Mappings. On entry,
*        the initial sequence of Mappings to be simplified should be
*        supplied.
*
*        On exit, the contents of this array will be modified to
*        reflect any simplification carried out. Any form of
*        simplification may be performed. This may involve any of: (a)
*        removing Mappings by annulling any of the pointers supplied,
*        (b) replacing them with pointers to new Mappings, (c)
*        inserting additional Mappings and (d) changing their order.
*
*        The intention is to reduce the number of Mappings in the
*        sequence, if possible, and any reduction will be reflected in
*        the value of "*nmap" returned. However, simplifications which
*        do not reduce the length of the sequence (but improve its
*        execution time, for example) may also be performed, and the
*        sequence might conceivably increase in length (but normally
*        only in order to split up a Mapping into pieces that can be
*        more easily merged with their neighbours on subsequent
*        invocations of this function).
*
*        If Mappings are removed from the sequence, any gaps that
*        remain will be closed up, by moving subsequent Mapping
*        pointers along in the array, so that vacated elements occur
*        at the end. If the sequence increases in length, the array
*        will be extended (and its pointer updated) if necessary to
*        accommodate any new elements.
*
*        Note that any (or all) of the Mapping pointers supplied in
*        this array may be annulled by this function, but the Mappings
*        to which they refer are not modified in any way (although
*        they may, of course, be deleted if the annulled pointer is
*        the final one).
*     invert_list
*        Address of a pointer to a dynamically allocated array which,
*        on entry, should contain values to be assigned to the Invert
*        attributes of the Mappings identified in the "*map_list"
*        array before they are applied (this array might have been
*        produced, for example, by the astMapList method). These
*        values will be used by this function instead of the actual
*        Invert attributes of the Mappings supplied, which are
*        ignored.
*
*        On exit, the contents of this array will be updated to
*        correspond with the possibly modified contents of the
*        "*map_list" array.  If the Mapping sequence increases in
*        length, the "*invert_list" array will be extended (and its
*        pointer updated) if necessary to accommodate any new
*        elements.

*  Returned Value:
*     If simplification was possible, the function returns the index
*     in the "map_list" array of the first element which was
*     modified. Otherwise, it returns -1 (and makes no changes to the
*     arrays supplied).

*  Notes:
*     - A value of -1 will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping method.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new Mapping by picking specified inputs from
*     an existing Mapping. This is only possible if the specified inputs
*     correspond to some subset of the Mapping outputs. That is, there
*     must exist a subset of the Mapping outputs for which each output
*     depends only on the selected Mapping inputs, and not on any of the
*     inputs which have not been selected. Also, any output which is not in
*     this subset must not depend on any of the selected inputs. If these
*     conditions are not met by the supplied Mapping, then a NULL Mapping
*     is returned.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Mapping to be split (the Mapping is not
*        actually modified by this function).
*     nin
*        The number of inputs to pick from "this".
*     in
*        Pointer to an array of indices (zero based) for the inputs which
*        are to be picked. This array should have "nin" elements. If "Nin"
*        is the number of inputs of the supplied Mapping, then each element
*        should have a value in the range zero to Nin-1.
*     map
*        Address of a location at which to return a pointer to the new
*        Mapping. This Mapping will have "nin" inputs (the number of
*        outputs may be differetn to "nin"). A NULL pointer will be
*        returned if the supplied Mapping has no subset of outputs which
*        depend only on the selected inputs. The returned Mapping is a
*        deep copy of the required parts of the supplied Mapping.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to a dynamically allocated array of ints. The number of
*     elements in this array will equal the number of outputs for the
*     returned Mapping. Each element will hold the index of the
*     corresponding output in the supplied Mapping. The array should be
*     freed using astFree when no longer needed. A NULL pointer will
*     be returned if no output Mapping can be created.

*  Notes:
*     - If this function is invoked with the global error status set,
*     or if it should fail for any reason, then NULL values will be
*     returned as the function value and for the "map" pointer.
*-

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the basic astMapSplit method available
*     via the protected interface to the Mapping class. The public
*     interface to this method is provided by the astMapSplitId_
*     function.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided for use during optimisation of a
*     Mapping function using the simplex method. It generates the
*     coordinates of a new simplex vertex and evaluates the Mapping
*     function at that point.  If the function's value is better then
*     (i.e. larger than) the value at the previously worst vertex,
*     then it is used to replace that vertex.

*  Parameters:
*     mapdata
*        Pointer to a MapData structure which describes the Mapping
*        function to be used.
*     lo
*        The (zero-based) index of the simplex vertex which initially
*        has the worst (lowest) value.
*     scale
*        The scale factor to be used to generate the new vertex. The
*        distance of the worst vertex from the centre of the face
*        opposite it is scaled by this factor to give the new vertex
*        position. Negative factors result in reflection through this
*        opposite face.
*     x
*        An array of double containing the coordinates of the vertices
*        of the simplex. The coordinates of the first vertex are
*        stored first, then those of the second vertex, etc. This
*        array will be updated by this function if the new vertex is
*        used to replace an existing one.
*     f
*        An array of double containing the Mapping function values at
*        each vertex of the simplex. This array will be updated by
*        this function if the new vertex is used to replace an
*        existing one.
*     ncall
*        Pointer to an int containing a count of the number of times
*        the Mapping function has been invoked. This value will be
*        updated to reflect the actions of this function.
*     xnew
*        An array of double with one element for each input coordinate
*        of the Mapping function. This is used as workspace.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     The Mapping function value at the new vertex. This value is
*     returned whether or not the new vertex replaces an existing one.

*  Notes:
*     - A value of AST__BAD will be returned by this function if it is
*     invoked with the global error status set, or if it should fail
*     for any reason.
*     - A value of AST__BAD will also be returned if the new vertex
*     lies outside the constrained range of input coordinates
*     associated with the Mapping function (as specified in the
*     MapData structure supplied) or if any of the transformed output
*     coordinates produced by the underlying Mapping is bad. In either
*     case the new vertex will not be used to replace an existing one.

*  Description:
*     This function evaluates the rate of change of a specified output of
*     the supplied Mapping with respect to a specified input, at a
*     specified input position.
*
*     The result is the mean gradient within a small interval centred on
*     the supplied position. The interval size is selected automatically
*     to minimise the error on the returned value. For large intervals,
*     the error is dominated by changes in the gradient of the
*     transformation. For small intervals, the error is dominated by
*     rounding errors. The best interval is the one that gives the most
*     consistent measure of the gradient within the interval. To find this
*     consistency, each candidate interval is subdivided into eight
*     sub-intervals, the mean gradient within each sub-interval is found,
*     and the associated consistency measure is then the difference between
*     the maximum and minimum sub-interval gradient found within the interval.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Mapping to be applied.
*     at
*        The address of an array holding the axis values at the position
*        at which the rate of change is to be evaluated. The number of
*        elements in this array should equal the number of inputs to the
*        Mapping.
*     ax1
*        The index of the Mapping output for which the rate of change is to
*        be found (output numbering starts at 0 for the first output).
*     ax2
*        The index of the Mapping input which is to be varied in order to
*        find the rate of change (input numbering starts at 0 for the first
*        input).

*  Returned Value:
*     astRate()
*        The rate of change of Mapping output "ax1" with respect to input
*        "ax2", evaluated at "at", or AST__BAD if the value cannot be
*        calculated.

*  Notes:
*     - A value of AST__BAD will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.
*-

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the basic astRate method available
*     via the protected interface to the Mapping class. The public
*     interface to this method is provided by the astRateId_
*     function.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping method.

*  Description:
*     This is a set of functions for rebinning gridded data (e.g. an
*     image) under the control of a geometrical transformation, which
*     is specified by a Mapping.  The functions operate on a pair of
*     data grids (input and output), each of which may have any number
*     of dimensions. Rebinning may be restricted to a specified
*     region of the input grid. An associated grid of error estimates
*     associated with the input data may also be supplied (in the form
*     of variance values), so as to produce error estimates for the
*     rebined output data. Propagation of missing data (bad pixels)
*     is supported.
*
*     Note, if you will be rebining a sequence of input arrays and then
*     co-adding them into a single array, the alternative
c     astRebinSeq<X> functions
f     AST_REBINSEQ<X> routines
*     will in general be more efficient.
*
*     You should use a rebinning function which matches the numerical
*     type of the data you are processing by replacing <X> in
c     the generic function name astRebin<X> by an appropriate 1- or
f     the generic function name AST_REBIN<X> by an appropriate 1- or
*     2-character type code. For example, if you are rebinning data
c     with type "float", you should use the function astRebinF (see
f     with type REAL, you should use the function AST_REBINR (see
*     the "Data Type Codes" section below for the codes appropriate to
*     other numerical types).
*
*     Rebinning of the grid of input data is performed by transforming
*     the coordinates of the centre of each input grid element (or pixel)
*     into the coordinate system of the output grid. The input pixel
*     value is then divided up and assigned to the output pixels in the
*     neighbourhood of the central output coordinates. A choice of
*     schemes are provided for determining how each input pixel value is
*     divided up between the output pixels. In general, each output pixel
*     may be assigned values from more than one input pixel. All
*     contributions to a given output pixel are summed to produce the
*     final output pixel value. Output pixels can be set to the supplied
*     bad value if they receive contributions from an insufficient number
*     of input pixels. This is controlled by the
c     "wlim" parameter.
f     WLIM argument.
*
*     Input pixel coordinates are transformed into the coordinate
*     system of the output grid using the forward transformation of the
*     Mapping which is supplied. This means that geometrical features
*     in the input data are subjected to the Mapping's forward
*     transformation as they are transferred from the input to the
*     output grid.
*
*     In practice, transforming the coordinates of every pixel of a
*     large data grid can be time-consuming, especially if the Mapping
*     involves complicated functions, such as sky projections. To
*     improve performance, it is therefore possible to approximate
*     non-linear Mappings by a set of linear transformations which are
*     applied piece-wise to separate sub-regions of the data. This
*     approximation process is applied automatically by an adaptive
*     algorithm, under control of an accuracy criterion which
*     expresses the maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may
*     be introduced, as a fraction of a pixel.
*
*     This algorithm first attempts to approximate the Mapping with a
*     linear transformation applied over the whole region of the
*     input grid which is being used. If this proves to be
*     insufficiently accurate, the input region is sub-divided into
*     two along its largest dimension and the process is repeated
*     within each of the resulting sub-regions. This process of
*     sub-division continues until a sufficiently good linear
*     approximation is found, or the region to which it is being
*     applied becomes too small (in which case the original Mapping is
*     used directly).

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to a Mapping, whose forward transformation will be
*        used to transform the coordinates of pixels in the input
*        grid into the coordinate system of the output grid.
*
*        The number of input coordinates used by this Mapping (as
*        given by its Nin attribute) should match the number of input
c        grid dimensions given by the value of "ndim_in"
f        grid dimensions given by the value of NDIM_IN
*        below. Similarly, the number of output coordinates (Nout
*        attribute) should match the number of output grid dimensions
c        given by "ndim_out".
f        given by NDIM_OUT.
c     wlim
f     WLIM = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        Gives the required number of input pixel values which must contribute
*        to an output pixel in order for the output pixel value to be
*        considered valid. If the sum of the input pixel weights contributing
*        to an output pixel is less than the supplied
c        "wlim"
f        WLIM
*        value, then the output pixel value is returned set to the
*        supplied bad value.
c     ndim_in
f     NDIM_IN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
c     lbnd_in
f     LBND_IN( NDIM_IN ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the first pixel
*        in the input grid along each dimension.
c     ubnd_in
f     UBND_IN( NDIM_IN ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the last pixel in
*        the input grid along each dimension.
*
c        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
f        Note that LBND_IN and UBND_IN together define the shape
*        and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
c        (j'th) dimension being ubnd_in[j]-lbnd_in[j]+1 (assuming the
c        index "j" to be zero-based). They also define
f        (J'th) dimension being UBND_IN(J)-LBND_IN(J)+1. They also define
*        the input grid's coordinate system, each pixel having unit
*        extent along each dimension with integral coordinate values
*        at its centre.
c     in
f     IN( * ) = <Xtype> (Given)
c        Pointer to an array, with one element for each pixel in the
f        An array, with one element for each pixel in the
*        input grid, containing the input data to be rebined.  The
*        numerical type of this array should match the 1- or
*        2-character type code appended to the function name (e.g. if
c        you are using astRebinF, the type of each array element
c        should be "float").
f        you are using AST_REBINR, the type of each array element
f        should be REAL).
*
*        The storage order of data within this array should be such
*        that the index of the first grid dimension varies most
*        rapidly and that of the final dimension least rapidly
c        (i.e. Fortran array indexing is used).
f        (i.e. normal Fortran array storage order).
c     in_var
f     IN_VAR( * ) = <Xtype> (Given)
c        An optional pointer to a second array with the same size and
c        type as the "in" array. If given, this should contain a set
c        of non-negative values which represent estimates of the
c        statistical variance associated with each element of the "in"
c        array. If this array is supplied (together with the
c        corresponding "out_var" array), then estimates of the
c        variance of the rebined output data will be calculated.
c
c        If no input variance estimates are being provided, a NULL
c        pointer should be given.
f        An optional second array with the same size and type as the
f        IN array. If the AST__USEVAR flag is set via the FLAGS
f        argument (below), this array should contain a set of
f        non-negative values which represent estimates of the
f        statistical variance associated with each element of the IN
f        array. Estimates of the variance of the rebined output data
f        will then be calculated.
f
f        If the AST__USEVAR flag is not set, no input variance
f        estimates are required and this array will not be used. A
f        dummy (e.g. one-element) array may then be supplied.
c     spread
f     SPREAD = INTEGER (Given)
c        This parameter specifies the scheme to be used for dividing
f        This argument specifies the scheme to be used for dividing
*        each input data value up amongst the corresponding output pixels.
*        It may be used to select
*        from a set of pre-defined schemes by supplying one of the
*        values described in the "Pixel Spreading Schemes"
*        section below.  If a value of zero is supplied, then the
*        default linear spreading scheme is used (equivalent to
*        supplying the value AST__LINEAR).
c     params
f     PARAMS( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
c        An optional pointer to an array of double which should contain
f        An optional array which should contain
*        any additional parameter values required by the pixel
*        spreading scheme. If such parameters are required, this
*        will be noted in the "Pixel Spreading Schemes"
*        section below.
*
c        If no additional parameters are required, this array is not
c        used and a NULL pointer may be given.
f        If no additional parameters are required, this array is not
f        used. A dummy (e.g. one-element) array may then be supplied.
c     flags
f     FLAGS = INTEGER (Given)
c        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which may be used to
f        The sum of a set of flag values which may be used to
*        provide additional control over the rebinning operation. See
*        the "Control Flags" section below for a description of the
*        options available.  If no flag values are to be set, a value
*        of zero should be given.
c     tol
f     TOL = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may be
*        introduced as a result of approximating non-linear Mappings
*        by a set of piece-wise linear transformations. This should be
*        expressed as a displacement in pixels in the output grid's
*        coordinate system.
*
*        If piece-wise linear approximation is not required, a value
*        of zero may be given. This will ensure that the Mapping is
*        used without any approximation, but may increase execution
*        time.
*
*        If the value is too high, discontinuities between the linear
*        approximations used in adjacent panel will be higher, and may
*        cause the edges of the panel to be visible when viewing the output
*        image at high contrast. If this is a problem, reduce the
*        tolerance value used.
c     maxpix
f     MAXPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        A value which specifies an initial scale size (in pixels) for
*        the adaptive algorithm which approximates non-linear Mappings
*        with piece-wise linear transformations. Normally, this should
*        be a large value (larger than any dimension of the region of
*        the input grid being used). In this case, a first attempt to
*        approximate the Mapping by a linear transformation will be
*        made over the entire input region.
*
*        If a smaller value is used, the input region will first be
c        divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed "maxpix"
f        divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed MAXPIX
*        pixels in any dimension. Only at this point will attempts at
*        approximation commence.
*
*        This value may occasionally be useful in preventing false
*        convergence of the adaptive algorithm in cases where the
*        Mapping appears approximately linear on large scales, but has
*        irregularities (e.g. holes) on smaller scales. A value of,
*        say, 50 to 100 pixels can also be employed as a safeguard in
*        general-purpose software, since the effect on performance is
*        minimal.
*
*        If too small a value is given, it will have the effect of
*        inhibiting linear approximation altogether (equivalent to
c        setting "tol" to zero). Although this may degrade
f        setting TOL to zero). Although this may degrade
*        performance, accurate results will still be obtained.
c     badval
f     BADVAL = <Xtype> (Given)
*        This argument should have the same type as the elements of
c        the "in" array. It specifies the value used to flag missing
f        the IN array. It specifies the value used to flag missing
*        data (bad pixels) in the input and output arrays.
*
c        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set via the "flags" parameter,
f        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set via the FLAGS argument,
c        then this value is used to test for bad pixels in the "in"
c        (and "in_var") array(s).
f        then this value is used to test for bad pixels in the IN
f        (and IN_VAR) array(s).
*
*        In all cases, this value is also used to flag any output
c        elements in the "out" (and "out_var") array(s) for which
f        elements in the OUT (and OUT_VAR) array(s) for which
*        rebined values could not be obtained (see the "Propagation
*        of Missing Data" section below for details of the
*        circumstances under which this may occur).
c     ndim_out
f     NDIM_OUT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
*        at least one. It need not necessarily be equal to the number
*        of dimensions in the input grid.
c     lbnd_out
f     LBND_OUT( NDIM_OUT ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the first pixel
*        in the output grid along each dimension.

f     UBND_OUT( NDIM_OUT ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the last pixel in
*        the output grid along each dimension.

f        Note that LBND_OUT and UBND_OUT together define the
*        shape, size and coordinate system of the output grid in the
c        same way as "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" define the shape, size
f        same way as LBND_IN and UBND_IN define the shape, size

c     lbnd
f     LBND( NDIM_IN ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements,
f        An array

*        should lie wholly within the extent of the input grid (as
c        defined by the "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" arrays). Regions of

*        output grid, in which the rebined data values will be
*        returned. The numerical type of this array should match that

*        that the index of the first grid dimension varies most

f        (i.e. normal Fortran array storage order).
c     out_var
f     OUT_VAR( * ) = <Xtype> (Returned)
c        An optional pointer to an array with the same type and size
c        as the "out" array. If given, this array will be used to
c        return variance estimates for the rebined data values. This
c        array will only be used if the "in_var" array has also been
c        supplied.
f        An optional array with the same type and size as the OUT
f        array. If the AST__USEVAR flag is set via the FLAGS argument,
f        this array will be used to return variance estimates for the
f        rebined data values.
*
*        The output variance values will be calculated on the
*        assumption that errors on the input data values are
*        statistically independent and that their variance estimates
*        may simply be summed (with appropriate weighting factors)
*        when several input pixels contribute to an output data
*        value. If this assumption is not valid, then the output error
*        estimates may be biased. In addition, note that the
*        statistical errors on neighbouring output data values (as
*        well as the estimates of those errors) may often be
*        correlated, even if the above assumption about the input data
*        is correct, because of the pixel spreading schemes
*        employed.
*
c        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
c        should be given.
f        If the AST__USEVAR flag is not set, no output variance
f        estimates will be calculated and this array will not be
f        used. A dummy (e.g. one-element) array may then be supplied.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Data Type Codes:
*     To select the appropriate rebinning function, you should
c     replace <X> in the generic function name astRebin<X> with a
f     replace <X> in the generic function name AST_REBIN<X> with a
*     1- or 2-character data type code, so as to match the numerical
*     type <Xtype> of the data you are processing, as follows:
c     - D: double
c     - F: float
c     - I: int
f     - D: DOUBLE PRECISION
f     - R: REAL
f     - I: INTEGER
*
c     For example, astRebinD would be used to process "double"
c     data, while astRebinI would be used to process "int"
c     data, etc.
f     For example, AST_REBIND would be used to process DOUBLE
f     PRECISION data, while AST_REBINI would be used to process
f     integer data (stored in an INTEGER array), etc.
*
*     Note that, unlike
c     astResample<X>, the astRebin<X>
f     AST_RESAMPLE<X>, the AST_REBIN<X>
*     set of functions does not yet support unsigned integer data types
*     or integers of different sizes.

*  Pixel Spreading Schemes:
*     The pixel spreading scheme specifies the Point Spread Function (PSF)
*     applied to each input pixel value as it is copied into the output
*     array. It can be thought of as the inverse of the sub-pixel
*     interpolation schemes used by the
c     astResample<X>
f     AST_RESAMPLE<X>
*     group of functions. That is, in a sub-pixel interpolation scheme the
*     kernel specifies the weight to assign to each input pixel when
*     forming the weighted mean of the input pixels, whereas the kernel in a
*     pixel spreading scheme specifies the fraction of the input data value
*     which is to be assigned to each output pixel. As for interpolation, the
*     choice of suitable pixel spreading scheme involves stricking a balance
*     between schemes which tend to degrade sharp features in the data by
*     smoothing them, and those which attempt to preserve sharp features but
*     which often tend to introduce unwanted artifacts. See the
c     astResample<X>
f     AST_RESAMPLE<X>
*     documentation for further discussion.
*
*     The binning algorithm used has the ability to introduce artifacts
*     not seen when using a resampling algorithm. Particularly, when
*     viewing the output image at high contrast, systems of curves lines
*     covering the entire image may be visible. These are caused by a
*     beating effect between the input pixel positions and the output pixels
*     position, and their nature and strength depend critically upon the
*     nature of the Mapping and the spreading function being used. In
*     general, the nearest neighbour spreading function demonstrates this
*     effect more clearly than the other functions, and for this reason
*     should be used with caution.
*
*     The following values (defined in the
c     "ast.h" header file)
f     AST_PAR include file)
*     may be assigned to the
c     "spread"
f     SPREAD
*     parameter. See the
c     astResample<X>
f     AST_RESAMPLE<X>
*     documentation for details of these schemes including the use of the
c     "fspread" and "params" parameters:
f     FSPREAD and PARAMS arguments:
*
*     - AST__NEAREST
*     - AST__LINEAR
*     - AST__SINC
*     - AST__SINCSINC
*     - AST__SINCCOS
*     - AST__SINCGAUSS
*     - AST__SOMBCOS
*
*     In addition, the following schemes can be used with
f     AST_REBIN<X> but not with AST_RESAMPLE<X>:
c     astRebin<X> but not with astResample<X>:
*
*     - AST__GAUSS: This scheme uses a kernel of the form exp(-k*x*x), with k
*     a positive constant determined by the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM).
*     The FWHM should be supplied in units of output pixels by means of the
c     "params[1]"
f     PARAMS(2)
*     value and should be at least 0.1. The
c     "params[0]"
f     PARAMS(1)
*     value should be used to specify at what point the Gaussian is truncated
*     to zero. This should be given as a number of output pixels on either
*     side of the central output point in each dimension (the nearest integer
*     value is used).

*  Control Flags:
c     The following flags are defined in the "ast.h" header file and
f     The following flags are defined in the AST_PAR include file and
*     may be used to provide additional control over the rebinning
*     process. Having selected a set of flags, you should supply the
c     bitwise OR of their values via the "flags" parameter:
f     sum of their values via the FLAGS argument:
*
*     - AST__USEBAD: Indicates that there may be bad pixels in the
*     input array(s) which must be recognised by comparing with the
c     value given for "badval" and propagated to the output array(s).
f     value given for BADVAL and propagated to the output array(s).
*     If this flag is not set, all input values are treated literally
c     and the "badval" value is only used for flagging output array
f     and the BADVAL value is only used for flagging output array
*     values.
f     - AST__USEVAR: Indicates that variance information should be
f     processed in order to provide estimates of the statistical error
f     associated with the rebined values. If this flag is not set,
f     no variance processing will occur and the IN_VAR and OUT_VAR
f     arrays will not be used. (Note that this flag is only available
f     in the Fortran interface to AST.)

*  Propagation of Missing Data:
*     Instances of missing data (bad pixels) in the output grid are
c     identified by occurrences of the "badval" value in the "out"
f     identified by occurrences of the BADVAL value in the OUT
*     array. These are produced if the sum of the weights of the
*     contributing input pixels is less than
c     "wlim".
f     WLIM.
*
*     An input pixel is considered bad (and is consequently ignored) if
*     its
c     data value is equal to "badval" and the AST__USEBAD flag is
c     set via the "flags" parameter.
f     data value is equal to BADVAL and the AST__USEBAD flag is
f     set via the FLAGS argument.
*
*     In addition, associated output variance estimates (if
c     calculated) may be declared bad and flagged with the "badval"
c     value in the "out_var" array for similar reasons.
f     calculated) may be declared bad and flagged with the BADVAL
f     value in the OUT_VAR array for similar reasons.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This function rebins a specified section of a rectangular grid of
*     data (with any number of dimensions) into another rectangular grid
*     (with a possibly different number of dimensions). The coordinate
*     transformation used to convert input pixel coordinates into positions
*     in the output grid is given by the forward transformation of the
*     Mapping which is supplied.  Any pixel spreading scheme may be specified
*     for distributing the flux of an input pixel amongst the output
*     pixels.
*
*     This function is very similar to RebinWithBlocking and RebinSection
*     which lie below it in the calling hierarchy. However, this function
*     also attempts to adapt to the Mapping supplied and to sub-divide the
*     section being rebinned into smaller sections within which a linear
*     approximation to the Mapping may be used.  This reduces the number of
*     Mapping evaluations, thereby improving efficiency particularly when
*     complicated Mappings are involved.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Mapping, whose forward transformation may be
*        used to transform the coordinates of pixels in the input
*        grid into associated positions in the output grid.
*
*        The number of input coordintes for the Mapping (Nin
*        attribute) should match the value of "ndim_in" (below), and
*        the number of output coordinates (Nout attribute) should
*        match the value of "ndim_out".
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the input data grid, its extent along a
*        particular (i'th) dimension being (ubnd_in[i] - lbnd_in[i] +
*        1). They also define the input grid's coordinate system, with
*        each pixel being of unit extent along each dimension with
*        integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the input array of data to be rebinned (with one
*        element for each pixel in the input grid). The numerical type
*        of these data should match the "type" value (below). The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and data type as the "in" array),
*        which represent estimates of the statistical variance
*        associated with each element of the "in" array. If this
*        second array is given (along with the corresponding "out_var"
*        array), then estimates of the variance of the rebinned data
*        will also be returned.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     type
*        A value taken from the "DataType" enum, which specifies the
*        data type of the input and output arrays containing the
*        gridded data (and variance) values.
*     spread
*        A value selected from a set of pre-defined macros to identify
*        which pixel spread function should be used.
*     params
*        Pointer to an optional array of parameters that may be passed
*        to the pixel spread algorithm, if required. If no parameters
*        are required, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which provide additional
*        control over the resampling operation.
*     tol
*        The maximum permitted positional error in transforming input
*        pixel positions into the output grid in order to rebin
*        it. This should be expressed as a displacement in pixels in
*        the output grid's coordinate system. If the Mapping's forward
*        transformation can be approximated by piecewise linear functions
*        to this accuracy, then such functions may be used instead of the
*        Mapping in order to improve performance. Otherwise, every input
*        pixel position will be transformed individually using the Mapping.
*
*        If linear approximation is not required, a "tol" value of
*        zero may be given. This will ensure that the Mapping is used
*        without any approximation.
*     maxpix
*        A value which specifies the largest scale size on which to
*        search for non-linearities in the Mapping supplied. This
*        value should be expressed as a number of pixels in the input
*        grid. The function will break the input section specified
*        into smaller sub-sections (if necessary), each no larger than
*        "maxpix" pixels in any dimension, before it attempts to
*        approximate the Mapping by a linear function over each
*        sub-section.
*
*        If the value given is larger than the largest dimension of
*        the input section (the normal recommendation), the function
*        will initially search for non-linearity on a scale determined
*        by the size of the input section.  This is almost always
*        satisfactory. Very occasionally, however, a Mapping may
*        appear linear on this scale but nevertheless have smaller
*        irregularities (e.g. "holes") in it.  In such cases, "maxpix"
*        may be set to a suitably smaller value so as to ensure this
*        non-linearity is not overlooked. Typically, a value of 50 to
*        100 pixels might be suitable and should have little effect on
*        performance.
*
*        If too small a value is given, however, it will have the
*        effect of preventing linear approximation occurring at all
*        (equivalent to setting "tol" to zero).  Although this may
*        degrade performance, accurate results will still be obtained.
*     badval_ptr
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set (above), this parameter is a
*        pointer to a value which is used to identify bad data and/or
*        variance values in the input array(s). The referenced value's
*        data type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. The same value will also be used to flag any output
*        array elements for which rebinned values could not be
*        obtained.  The output arrays(s) may be flagged with this
*        value whether or not the AST__USEBAD flag is set (the
*        function return value indicates whether any such values have
*        been produced).
*     ndim_out
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
*        at least one.
*     lbnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the shape
*        and size of the output data grid in the same way as "lbnd_in"
*        and "ubnd_in" define the shape and size of the input grid
*        (see above).
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the first pixel in the
*        section of the input data grid which is to be rebinned.
*     ubnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the last pixel in the
*        section of the input data grid which is to be rebinned.
*
*        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" define the shape and position of
*        the section of the input grid which is to be rebinned. This section
*        should lie wholly within the extent of the input grid (as defined
*        by the "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" arrays). Regions of the input
*        grid lying outside this section will be ignored.
*     npix_out
*        The number of pixels in the output array.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the rebinned data will be returned.  The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the rebinned values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given.
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.
*     work
*        An optional pointer to a double array with the same size as
*        the "out" array. The contents of this array (if supplied) are
*        incremented by the accumulated weights assigned to each output pixel.
*        If no accumulated weights are required, a NULL pointer should be
*        given.
*     nused
*        An optional pointer to a int64_t which will be incremented by the
*        number of input values pasted into the output array. Ignored if NULL.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if "flags" included AST__CONSERVEFLUX (i.e.
*     flux conservation was requested), but the forward transformation of the
*     supplied Mapping had zero determinant everywhere within the region
*     being binned (no error is reported if this happens). Zero is returned
*     otherwise.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This function rebins a specified section of a rectangular grid of
*     data (with any number of dimensions) into another rectangular grid
*     (with a possibly different number of dimensions). The coordinate
*     transformation used to convert input pixel coordinates into positions
*     in the output grid is given by the forward transformation of the
*     Mapping which is supplied or, alternatively, by a linear approximation
*     fitted to a Mapping's forward transformation. Any pixel spreading scheme
*     may be specified for distributing the flux of an input pixel amongst
*     the output pixels.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Mapping, whose forward transformation may be
*        used to transform the coordinates of pixels in the input
*        grid into associated positions in the output grid.
*
*        The number of input coordintes for the Mapping (Nin
*        attribute) should match the value of "ndim_in" (below), and
*        the number of output coordinates (Nout attribute) should
*        match the value of "ndim_out".
*     linear_fit
*        Pointer to an optional array of double which contains the
*        coefficients of a linear fit which approximates the above
*        Mapping's forward coordinate transformation. If this is
*        supplied, it will be used in preference to the above Mapping
*        when transforming coordinates. This may be used to enhance
*        performance in cases where evaluation of the Mapping's
*        forward transformation is expensive. If no linear fit is
*        available, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*
*        The way in which the fit coefficients are stored in this
*        array and the number of array elements are as defined by the
*        astLinearApprox function.
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the input data grid, its extent along a
*        particular (i'th) dimension being (ubnd_in[i] - lbnd_in[i] +
*        1). They also define the input grid's coordinate system, with
*        each pixel being of unit extent along each dimension with
*        integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the input array of data to be rebinned (with one
*        element for each pixel in the input grid). The numerical type
*        of these data should match the "type" value (below). The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and data type as the "in" array),
*        which represent estimates of the statistical variance
*        associated with each element of the "in" array. If this
*        second array is given (along with the corresponding "out_var"
*        array), then estimates of the variance of the rebinned data
*        will also be returned.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     infac
*        A factor by which to multiply the input data values before use.
*     type
*        A value taken from the "DataType" enum, which specifies the
*        data type of the input and output arrays containing the
*        gridded data (and variance) values.
*     spread
*        A value selected from a set of pre-defined macros to identify
*        which pixel spread function should be used.
*     params
*        Pointer to an optional array of parameters that may be passed
*        to the pixel spread algorithm, if required. If no parameters
*        are required, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which provide additional
*        control over the resampling operation.
*     badval_ptr
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set (above), this parameter is a
*        pointer to a value which is used to identify bad data and/or
*        variance values in the input array(s). The referenced value's
*        data type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. The same value will also be used to flag any output
*        array elements for which rebinned values could not be
*        obtained.  The output arrays(s) may be flagged with this
*        value whether or not the AST__USEBAD flag is set (the
*        function return value indicates whether any such values have
*        been produced).
*     ndim_out
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
*        at least one.
*     lbnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the shape
*        and size of the output data grid in the same way as "lbnd_in"
*        and "ubnd_in" define the shape and size of the input grid
*        (see above).
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the first pixel in the
*        section of the input data grid which is to be rebinned.
*     ubnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the last pixel in the
*        section of the input data grid which is to be rebinned.
*
*        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" define the shape and position of
*        the section of the input grid which is to be rebinned. This section
*        should lie wholly within the extent of the input grid (as defined
*        by the "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" arrays). Regions of the input
*        grid lying outside this section will be ignored.
*     npix_out
*        The number of pixels in the output array.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the rebinned data will be returned.  The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the rebinned values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given.
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.
*     work
*        An optional pointer to a double array with the same size as
*        the "out" array. The contents of this array (if supplied) are
*        incremented by the accumulated weights assigned to each output pixel.
*        If no accumulated weights are required, a NULL pointer should be
*        given.
*     nused
*        An optional pointer to a int64_t which will be incremented by the
*        number of input values pasted into the output array. Ignored if NULL.

*  Notes:
*     - This function does not take steps to limit memory usage if the
*     grids supplied are large. To resample large grids in a more
*     memory-efficient way, the ResampleWithBlocking function should
*     be used.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping method.

*  Description:
*     This set of
c     functions is identical to astRebin<X>
f     routines is identical to AST_REBIN<X>
*     except that the rebinned input data is added into the supplied
*     output arrays, rather than simply over-writing the contents of the
*     output arrays. Thus, by calling this
c     function
f     routine
*     repeatedly, a sequence of input arrays can be rebinned and accumulated
*     into a single output array, effectively forming a mosaic of the
*     input data arrays.
*
*     In addition, the weights associated with each output pixel are
*     returned. The weight of an output pixel indicates the number of input
*     pixels which have been accumulated in that output pixel. If the entire
*     value of an input pixel is assigned to a single output pixel, then the
*     weight of that output pixel is incremented by one. If some fraction of
*     the value of an input pixel is assigned to an output pixel, then the
*     weight of that output pixel is incremented by the fraction used.
*
*     The start of a new sequence is indicated by specifying the
*     AST__REBININIT flag via the
c     "flags" parameter.
f     FLAGS argument.
*     This causes the supplied arrays to be filled with zeros before the
*     rebinned input data is added into them. Subsequenct invocations
*     within the same sequence should omit the AST__REBININIT flag.
*
*     The last call in a sequence is indicated by specifying the
*     AST__REBINEND flag. Depending on which flags are supplied, this may
*     cause the output data and variance arrays to be normalised before
*     being returned. This normalisation consists of dividing the data
*     array by the weights array, and can eliminate artifacts which may be
*     introduced into the rebinned data as a consequence of aliasing
*     between the input and output grids. This results in each output
*     pixel value being the weighted mean of the input pixel values that
*     fall in the neighbourhood of the output pixel (rather like
c     astResample<X>).
f     AST_RESAMPLE<X>).
*     Optionally, these normalised
*     values can then be multiplied by a scaling factor to ensure that the
*     total data sum in any small area is unchanged. This scaling factor
*     is equivalent to the number of input pixel values that fall into each
*     output pixel. In addition to
*     normalisation of the output data values, any output variances are
*     also appropriately normalised, and any output data values with
*     weight less than
c     "wlim" are set to "badval".
f     WLIM are set to BADVAL.
*
*     Output variances can be generated in two ways; by rebinning the supplied
*     input variances with appropriate weights, or by finding the spread of
*     input data values contributing to each output pixel (see the AST__GENVAR
*     and AST__USEVAR flags).

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to a Mapping, whose forward transformation will be
*        used to transform the coordinates of pixels in the input
*        grid into the coordinate system of the output grid.
*
*        The number of input coordinates used by this Mapping (as
*        given by its Nin attribute) should match the number of input
c        grid dimensions given by the value of "ndim_in"
f        grid dimensions given by the value of NDIM_IN
*        below. Similarly, the number of output coordinates (Nout
*        attribute) should match the number of output grid dimensions
c        given by "ndim_out".
f        given by NDIM_OUT.
c        If "in" is NULL, the Mapping will not be used, but a valid
c        Mapping must still be supplied.
c     wlim
f     WLIM = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        This value is only used if the AST__REBINEND flag is specified
*        via the
c        "flags" parameter.
f        FLAGS argument.
*        It gives the required number of input pixel values which must
*        contribute to an output pixel (i.e. the output pixel weight) in
*        order for the output pixel value to be considered valid. If the sum
*        of the input pixel weights contributing to an output pixel is less
*        than the supplied
c        "wlim"
f        WLIM
*        value, then the output pixel value is returned set to the
*        supplied bad value. If the supplied value is less than 1.0E-10
*        then 1.0E-10 is used instead.
c     ndim_in
f     NDIM_IN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
c        Not used if "in" is NULL.
c     lbnd_in
f     LBND_IN( NDIM_IN ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the first pixel
*        in the input grid along each dimension.

c     ubnd_in
f     UBND_IN( NDIM_IN ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the last pixel in
*        the input grid along each dimension.

f        Note that LBND_IN and UBND_IN together define the shape
*        and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
c        (j'th) dimension being ubnd_in[j]-lbnd_in[j]+1 (assuming the
c        index "j" to be zero-based). They also define
f        (J'th) dimension being UBND_IN(J)-LBND_IN(J)+1. They also define
*        the input grid's coordinate system, each pixel having unit
*        extent along each dimension with integral coordinate values
*        at its centre.
c        Not used if "in" is NULL.
c     in
f     IN( * ) = <Xtype> (Given)
c        Pointer to an array, with one element for each pixel in the
f        An array, with one element for each pixel in the
*        input grid, containing the input data to be rebined.  The
*        numerical type of this array should match the 1- or
*        2-character type code appended to the function name (e.g. if
c        you are using astRebinSeqF, the type of each array element
c        should be "float").
f        you are using AST_REBINSEQR, the type of each array element
f        should be REAL).
*
*        The storage order of data within this array should be such
*        that the index of the first grid dimension varies most
*        rapidly and that of the final dimension least rapidly
c        (i.e. Fortran array indexing is used).
f        (i.e. normal Fortran array storage order).
c        If a NULL pointer is supplied for "in", then no data is added to
c        the output arrays, but any initialisation or normalisation
c        requested by "flags" is still performed.
c     in_var
f     IN_VAR( * ) = <Xtype> (Given)
*        An optional
c        pointer to a
*        second array with the same size and type as the
c        "in"
f        IN
*        array. If given, this should contain a set of non-negative values
*        which represent estimates of the statistical variance associated
*        with each element of the
c        "in"
f        IN
*        array.
*        If neither the AST__USEVAR nor the AST__VARWGT flag is set, no
*        input variance estimates are required and this
f        array
c        pointer
*        will not be used.
f        A dummy (e.g. one-element) array
c        A NULL pointer
*        may then be supplied.
c     spread
f     SPREAD = INTEGER (Given)
c        This parameter specifies the scheme to be used for dividing
f        This argument specifies the scheme to be used for dividing
*        each input data value up amongst the corresponding output pixels.
*        It may be used to select
*        from a set of pre-defined schemes by supplying one of the
*        values described in the "Pixel Spreading Schemes"
*        section in the description of the
c        astRebin<X> functions.
f        AST_REBIN<X> routines.
*        If a value of zero is supplied, then the default linear spreading
*        scheme is used (equivalent to supplying the value AST__LINEAR).
c        Not used if "in" is NULL.
c     params
f     PARAMS( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
c        An optional pointer to an array of double which should contain
f        An optional array which should contain
*        any additional parameter values required by the pixel
*        spreading scheme. If such parameters are required, this
*        will be noted in the "Pixel Spreading Schemes" section in the
*        description of the
c        astRebin<X> functions.
f        AST_REBIN<X> routines.
*
c        If no additional parameters are required, this array is not
c        used and a NULL pointer may be given.
f        If no additional parameters are required, this array is not
f        used. A dummy (e.g. one-element) array may then be supplied.
c        Not used if "in" is NULL.
c     flags
f     FLAGS = INTEGER (Given)
c        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which may be used to
f        The sum of a set of flag values which may be used to
*        provide additional control over the rebinning operation. See
*        the "Control Flags" section below for a description of the
*        options available.  If no flag values are to be set, a value
*        of zero should be given.
c     tol
f     TOL = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may be
*        introduced as a result of approximating non-linear Mappings
*        by a set of piece-wise linear transformations. This should be
*        expressed as a displacement in pixels in the output grid's
*        coordinate system.
*
*        If piece-wise linear approximation is not required, a value
*        of zero may be given. This will ensure that the Mapping is
*        used without any approximation, but may increase execution
*        time.
*
*        If the value is too high, discontinuities between the linear
*        approximations used in adjacent panel will be higher, and may
*        cause the edges of the panel to be visible when viewing the output
*        image at high contrast. If this is a problem, reduce the
*        tolerance value used.
c        Not used if "in" is NULL.
c     maxpix
f     MAXPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        A value which specifies an initial scale size (in pixels) for
*        the adaptive algorithm which approximates non-linear Mappings
*        with piece-wise linear transformations. Normally, this should
*        be a large value (larger than any dimension of the region of
*        the input grid being used). In this case, a first attempt to
*        approximate the Mapping by a linear transformation will be
*        made over the entire input region.
*
*        If a smaller value is used, the input region will first be
c        divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed "maxpix"
f        divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed MAXPIX
*        pixels in any dimension. Only at this point will attempts at
*        approximation commence.
*
*        This value may occasionally be useful in preventing false
*        convergence of the adaptive algorithm in cases where the
*        Mapping appears approximately linear on large scales, but has
*        irregularities (e.g. holes) on smaller scales. A value of,
*        say, 50 to 100 pixels can also be employed as a safeguard in
*        general-purpose software, since the effect on performance is
*        minimal.
*
*        If too small a value is given, it will have the effect of
*        inhibiting linear approximation altogether (equivalent to
c        setting "tol" to zero). Although this may degrade
f        setting TOL to zero). Although this may degrade
*        performance, accurate results will still be obtained.
c        Not used if "in" is NULL.
c     badval
f     BADVAL = <Xtype> (Given)
*        This argument should have the same type as the elements of
c        the "in" array. It specifies the value used to flag missing
f        the IN array. It specifies the value used to flag missing
*        data (bad pixels) in the input and output arrays.
*
c        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set via the "flags" parameter,
f        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set via the FLAGS argument,
c        then this value is used to test for bad pixels in the "in"
c        (and "in_var") array(s).
f        then this value is used to test for bad pixels in the IN
f        (and IN_VAR) array(s).
*
*        In all cases, this value is also used to flag any output
c        elements in the "out" (and "out_var") array(s) for which
f        elements in the OUT (and OUT_VAR) array(s) for which
*        rebined values could not be obtained (see the "Propagation
*        of Missing Data" section below for details of the
*        circumstances under which this may occur).
c     ndim_out
f     NDIM_OUT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
*        at least one. It need not necessarily be equal to the number
*        of dimensions in the input grid.

f        OUT

f        array

c        NULL pointer
f        dummy (e.g. one-element) array

c     weights
f     WEIGHTS( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given and Returned)
c        Pointer to an array of double,
f        An array

c        "flags".
f        FLAGS.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Data Type Codes:
*     To select the appropriate rebinning function, you should
c     replace <X> in the generic function name astRebinSeq<X> with a
f     replace <X> in the generic function name AST_REBINSEQ<X> with a
*     1- or 2-character data type code, so as to match the numerical
*     type <Xtype> of the data you are processing, as follows:
c     - D: double
c     - F: float
c     - I: int
f     - D: DOUBLE PRECISION
f     - R: REAL
f     - I: INTEGER
*
c     For example, astRebinSeqD would be used to process "double"
c     data, while astRebinSeqI would be used to process "int"
c     data, etc.
f     For example, AST_REBIND would be used to process DOUBLE
f     PRECISION data, while AST_REBINI would be used to process
f     integer data (stored in an INTEGER array), etc.
*
*     Note that, unlike
c     astResample<X>, the astRebinSeq<X>
f     AST_RESAMPLE<X>, the AST_REBINSEQ<X>
*     set of functions does not yet support unsigned integer data types
*     or integers of different sizes.

*  Control Flags:
c     The following flags are defined in the "ast.h" header file and
f     The following flags are defined in the AST_PAR include file and
*     may be used to provide additional control over the rebinning
*     process. Having selected a set of flags, you should supply the
c     bitwise OR of their values via the "flags" parameter:
f     sum of their values via the FLAGS argument:
*
*     - AST__REBININIT: Used to mark the first call in a sequence. It indicates
*     that the supplied
c     "out", "out_var" and "weights"
f     OUT, OUT_VAR and WEIGHTS
*     arrays should be filled with zeros (thus over-writing any supplied
*     values) before adding the rebinned input data into them. This flag
*     should be used when rebinning the first input array in a sequence.
*     - AST__REBINEND: Used to mark the last call in a sequence. It causes
*     each value in the
c     "out" and "out_var"
f     OUT and OUT_VAR
*     arrays to be divided by a normalisation factor before being
*     returned. The normalisation factor for each output data value is just
*     the corresponding value from the weights array. The normalisation
*     factor for each output variance value is the square of the data value
*     normalisation factor (see also AST__CONSERVEFLUX). It also causes
*     output data values to be set bad if the corresponding weight is less
*     than the value supplied for
c     parameter "wlim".
f     argument WLIM.
*     It also causes any temporary values stored in the output variance array
*     (see flag AST__GENVAR below) to be converted into usable variance values.
*     Note, this flag is ignored if the AST__NONORM flag is set.
*     - AST__USEBAD: Indicates that there may be bad pixels in the
*     input array(s) which must be recognised by comparing with the
c     value given for "badval" and propagated to the output array(s).
f     value given for BADVAL and propagated to the output array(s).
*     If this flag is not set, all input values are treated literally
c     and the "badval" value is only used for flagging output array
f     and the BADVAL value is only used for flagging output array
*     values.
*     - AST__USEVAR: Indicates that output variance estimates should be
*     created by rebinning the supplied input variance estimates. An
*     error will be reported if both this flag and the AST__GENVAR flag
*     are supplied.
*     - AST__GENVAR: Indicates that output variance estimates should be
*     created based on the spread of input data values contributing to each
*     output pixel. An error will be reported if both this flag and the
*     AST__USEVAR flag are supplied. If the AST__GENVAR flag is specified,
*     the supplied output variance array is first used as a work array to
*     accumulate the temporary values needed to generate the output
*     variances. When the sequence ends (as indicated by the
*     AST__REBINEND flag), the contents of the output variance array are
*     converted into the required variance estimates. If the generation of
*     such output variances is required, this flag should be used on every
*     invocation of this
c     function
f     routine
*     within a sequence, and any supplied input variances will have no effect
*     on the output variances (although input variances will still be used
*     to weight the input data if the AST__VARWGT flag is also supplied).
*     The statistical meaning of these output varianes is determined by
*     the presence or absence of the AST__DISVAR flag (see below).
*     - AST__DISVAR: This flag is ignored unless the AST__GENVAR flag
*     has also been specified. It determines the statistical meaning of
*     the generated output variances. If AST__DISVAR is not specified,
*     generated variances represent variances on the output mean  values. If
*     AST__DISVAR is specified, the generated variances represent the variance
*     of the distribution from which the input values were taken. Each output
*     variance created with AST__DISVAR will be larger than that created
*     without AST__DISVAR by a factor equal to the number of input samples
*     that contribute to the output sample.
*     - AST__VARWGT: Indicates that the input data should be weighted by
*     the reciprocal of the input variances. Otherwise, all input data are
*     given equal weight. If this flag is specified, the calculation of the
*     output variances (if any) is modified to take account of the
*     varying weights assigned to the input data values.
*     - AST__NONORM: If the simple unnormalised sum of all input data falling
*     in each output pixel is required, then this flag should be set on
*     each call in the sequence and the AST__REBINEND should not be used
*     on the last call. In this case
c     NULL pointers can be supplied for "weights" and "nused".
f     WEIGHTS and NUSED are ignored.
*     This flag cannot be used with the AST__CONSERVEFLUX, AST__GENVAR
*     or AST__VARWGT flag.
*     - AST__CONSERVEFLUX: Indicates that the normalized output pixel values
*     generated by the AST__REBINEND flag should be scaled in such a way as
*     to preserve the total data value in a feature on the sky. Without this
*     flag, each normalised output pixel value represents a weighted mean
*     of the input data values around the corresponding input position.
f     (i.e. AST_REBINSEQ<F> behaves similarly to AST_RESAMPLE<X>). This
f     (i.e. AST_REBINSEQ<F> behaves similarly to AST_RESAMPLE<X>). This
*     is appropriate if the input data represents the spatial density of
*     some quantity (e.g. surface brightness in Janskys per square
*     arc-second) because the output pixel values will have the same
*     normalisation and units as the input pixel values. However, if the
*     input data values represent flux (or some other physical quantity)
*     per pixel, then the AST__CONSERVEFLUX flag could be of use. It causes
*     each output pixel value to be scaled by the ratio of the output pixel
*     size to the input pixel size.
*
*     This flag can only be used if the Mapping is successfully approximated
*     by one or more linear transformations. Thus an error will be reported
*     if it used when the
c     "tol" parameter
f     TOL argument
*     is set to zero (which stops the use of linear approximations), or
*     if the Mapping is too non-linear to be approximated by a piece-wise
*     linear transformation. The ratio of output to input pixel size is
*     evaluated once for each panel of the piece-wise linear approximation to
*     the Mapping, and is assumed to be constant for all output pixels in the
*     panel. The scaling factors for adjacent panels will in general
*     differ slightly, and so the joints between panels may be visible when
*     viewing the output image at high contrast. If this is a problem,
*     reduce the value of the
c     "tol" parameter
f     TOL argument
*     until the difference between adjacent panels is sufficiently small
*     to be insignificant.
*
*     This flag should normally be supplied on each invocation of
c     astRebinSeq<X>
f     AST_REBINSEQ<X>
*     within a given sequence.
*
*     Note, this flag cannot be used in conjunction with the AST__NOSCALE
*     flag (an error will be reported if both flags are specified).

*  Propagation of Missing Data:
*     Instances of missing data (bad pixels) in the output grid are
c     identified by occurrences of the "badval" value in the "out"
f     identified by occurrences of the BADVAL value in the OUT
*     array. These are only produced if the AST__REBINEND flag is
*     specified and a pixel has zero weight.
*
*     An input pixel is considered bad (and is consequently ignored) if
*     its
c     data value is equal to "badval" and the AST__USEBAD flag is
c     set via the "flags" parameter.
f     data value is equal to BADVAL and the AST__USEBAD flag is
f     set via the FLAGS argument.
*
*     In addition, associated output variance estimates (if
c     calculated) may be declared bad and flagged with the "badval"
c     value in the "out_var" array for similar reasons.
f     calculated) may be declared bad and flagged with the BADVAL
f     value in the OUT_VAR array for similar reasons.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This function rebins a specified section of a rectangular grid of
*     data (with any number of dimensions) into another rectangular grid
*     (with a possibly different number of dimensions). The coordinate
*     transformation used to convert input pixel coordinates into positions
*     in the output grid is given by the forward transformation of the
*     Mapping which is supplied.  Any pixel spreading scheme may be specified
*     for distributing the flux of an input pixel amongst the output
*     pixels.
*
*     This function is very similar to RebinSection, except that in
*     order to limit memory usage and to ensure locality of reference,
*     it divides the input grid up into "blocks" which have a limited
*     extent along each input dimension. Each block, which will not
*     contain more than a pre-determined maximum number of pixels, is
*     then passed to RebinSection for resampling.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Mapping, whose forward transformation may be
*        used to transform the coordinates of pixels in the input
*        grid into associated positions in the output grid.
*
*        The number of input coordintes for the Mapping (Nin
*        attribute) should match the value of "ndim_in" (below), and
*        the number of output coordinates (Nout attribute) should
*        match the value of "ndim_out".
*     linear_fit
*        Pointer to an optional array of double which contains the
*        coefficients of a linear fit which approximates the above
*        Mapping's forward coordinate transformation. If this is
*        supplied, it will be used in preference to the above Mapping
*        when transforming coordinates. This may be used to enhance
*        performance in cases where evaluation of the Mapping's
*        forward transformation is expensive. If no linear fit is
*        available, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*
*        The way in which the fit coefficients are stored in this
*        array and the number of array elements are as defined by the
*        astLinearApprox function.
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the input data grid, its extent along a
*        particular (i'th) dimension being (ubnd_in[i] - lbnd_in[i] +
*        1). They also define the input grid's coordinate system, with
*        each pixel being of unit extent along each dimension with
*        integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the input array of data to be rebinned (with one
*        element for each pixel in the input grid). The numerical type
*        of these data should match the "type" value (below). The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and data type as the "in" array),
*        which represent estimates of the statistical variance
*        associated with each element of the "in" array. If this
*        second array is given (along with the corresponding "out_var"
*        array), then estimates of the variance of the rebinned data
*        will also be returned.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     type
*        A value taken from the "DataType" enum, which specifies the
*        data type of the input and output arrays containing the
*        gridded data (and variance) values.
*     spread
*        A value selected from a set of pre-defined macros to identify
*        which pixel spread function should be used.
*     params
*        Pointer to an optional array of parameters that may be passed
*        to the pixel spread algorithm, if required. If no parameters
*        are required, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which provide additional
*        control over the resampling operation.
*     badval_ptr
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set (above), this parameter is a
*        pointer to a value which is used to identify bad data and/or
*        variance values in the input array(s). The referenced value's
*        data type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. The same value will also be used to flag any output
*        array elements for which rebinned values could not be
*        obtained.  The output arrays(s) may be flagged with this
*        value whether or not the AST__USEBAD flag is set (the
*        function return value indicates whether any such values have
*        been produced).
*     ndim_out
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
*        at least one.
*     lbnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the shape
*        and size of the output data grid in the same way as "lbnd_in"
*        and "ubnd_in" define the shape and size of the input grid
*        (see above).
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the first pixel in the
*        section of the input data grid which is to be rebinned.
*     ubnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the last pixel in the
*        section of the input data grid which is to be rebinned.
*
*        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" define the shape and position of
*        the section of the input grid which is to be rebinned. This section
*        should lie wholly within the extent of the input grid (as defined
*        by the "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" arrays). Regions of the input
*        grid lying outside this section will be ignored.
*     npix_out
*        The number of pixels in the output array.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the rebinned data will be returned.  The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the rebinned values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given.
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.
*     work
*        An optional pointer to a double array with the same size as
*        the "out" array. The contents of this array (if supplied) are
*        incremented by the accumulated weights assigned to each output pixel.
*        If no accumulated weights are required, a NULL pointer should be
*        given.
*     nused
*        An optional pointer to a int64_t which will be incremented by the
*        number of input values pasted into the output array. Ignored if NULL.

*  Returned Value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if "flags" included AST__CONSERVEFLUX (i.e.
*     flux conservation was requested), but the supplied linear fit to the
*     forward transformation of the Mapping had zero determinant (no error
*     is reported if this happens). Zero is returned otherwise.

*  Description:
*     This function searches the suppliedMapping (which may be a
*     compound Mapping such as a CmpMap) for any component Mappings
*     that are instances of the AST Region class. It then creates a new
*     Mapping from which all Regions have been removed. If a Region
*     cannot simply be removed (for instance, if it is a component of a
*     parallel CmpMap), then it is replaced with an equivalent UnitMap
*     in the returned Mapping.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the original Mapping.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astRemoveRegions()
f     AST_REMOVEREGIONS = INTEGER
*        A new pointer to the (possibly modified) Mapping.

*  Applicability:
*     CmpFrame
*        If the supplied Mapping is a CmpFrame, any component Frames that
*        are instances of the Region class are replaced by the equivalent
*        Frame.
*     FrameSet
*        If the supplied Mapping is a FrameSet, the returned Mapping
*        will be a copy of the supplied FrameSet in which Regions have
*        been removed from all the inter-Frame Mappings, and any Frames
*        which are instances of the Region class are repalced by the
*        equivalent Frame.
*     Mapping
*        This function applies to all Mappings.
*     Region
*        If the supplied Mapping is a Region, the returned Mapping will
*        be the equivalent Frame.

*  Notes:
*     - This function can safely be applied even to Mappings which
*     contain no Regions. If no Regions are found, it
c     behaves exactly like astClone and returns a pointer to the
f     behaves exactly like AST_CLONE and returns a pointer to the
*     original Mapping.
*     - The Mapping returned by this function may not be independent
*     of the original (even if some Regions were removed), and
*     modifying it may therefore result in indirect modification of
*     the original. If a completely independent result is required, a
c     copy should be made using astCopy.
f     copy should be made using AST_COPY.
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it

*     data grids (input and output), each of which may have any number
*     of dimensions. Resampling may be restricted to a specified
*     region of the output grid. An associated grid of error estimates
*     associated with the input data may also be supplied (in the form
*     of variance values), so as to produce error estimates for the
*     resampled output data. Propagation of missing data (bad pixels)
*     is supported.
*
*     You should use a resampling function which matches the numerical
*     type of the data you are processing by replacing <X> in
c     the generic function name astResample<X> by an appropriate 1- or
f     the generic function name AST_RESAMPLE<X> by an appropriate 1- or
*     2-character type code. For example, if you are resampling data
c     with type "float", you should use the function astResampleF (see
f     with type REAL, you should use the function AST_RESAMPLER (see
*     the "Data Type Codes" section below for the codes appropriate to
*     other numerical types).
*
*     Resampling of the grid of input data is performed by
*     transforming the coordinates of the centre of each output grid
*     element (or pixel) into the coordinate system of the input grid.
*     Since the resulting coordinates will not, in general, coincide
*     with the centre of an input pixel, sub-pixel interpolation is
*     performed between the neighbouring input pixels. This produces a
*     resampled value which is then assigned to the output pixel. A
*     choice of sub-pixel interpolation schemes is provided, but you
*     may also implement your own.
*
*     This algorithm samples the input data value, it does not integrate
*     it. Thus total data value in the input image will not, in general,
*     be conserved. However, an option is provided (see the "Control Flags"
*     section below) which can produce approximate flux conservation by
*     scaling the output values using the ratio of the output pixel size
*     to the input pixel size. However, if accurate flux conservation is
*     important to you, consder using the
c     astRebin<X> or astRebinSeq<X> family of functions
f     AST_REBIN<X> or AST_REBINSEQ<X> family of routines
*     instead.
*
*     Output pixel coordinates are transformed into the coordinate
*     system of the input grid using the inverse transformation of the
*     Mapping which is supplied. This means that geometrical features
*     in the input data are subjected to the Mapping's forward
*     transformation as they are transferred from the input to the
*     output grid (although the Mapping's forward transformation is
*     not explicitly used).
*
*     In practice, transforming the coordinates of every pixel of a
*     large data grid can be time-consuming, especially if the Mapping
*     involves complicated functions, such as sky projections. To
*     improve performance, it is therefore possible to approximate
*     non-linear Mappings by a set of linear transformations which are
*     applied piece-wise to separate sub-regions of the data. This
*     approximation process is applied automatically by an adaptive
*     algorithm, under control of an accuracy criterion which
*     expresses the maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may
*     be introduced, as a fraction of a pixel.
*
*     This algorithm first attempts to approximate the Mapping with a
*     linear transformation applied over the whole region of the
*     output grid which is being used. If this proves to be
*     insufficiently accurate, the output region is sub-divided into
*     two along its largest dimension and the process is repeated
*     within each of the resulting sub-regions. This process of
*     sub-division continues until a sufficiently good linear
*     approximation is found, or the region to which it is being
*     applied becomes too small (in which case the original Mapping is
*     used directly).

f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)

c        should be "float").
f        you are using AST_RESAMPLER, the type of each array element
f        should be REAL).

f     IN_VAR( * ) = <Xtype> (Given)
c        An optional pointer to a second array with the same size and
c        type as the "in" array. If given, this should contain a set
c        of non-negative values which represent estimates of the

f        estimates are required and this array will not be used. A

c     interp
f     INTERP = INTEGER (Given)
c        This parameter specifies the scheme to be used for sub-pixel
f        This argument specifies the scheme to be used for sub-pixel
*        interpolation within the input grid. It may be used to select
*        from a set of pre-defined schemes by supplying one of the
*        values described in the "Sub-Pixel Interpolation Schemes"
*        section below.  If a value of zero is supplied, then the
*        default linear interpolation scheme is used (equivalent to

*
*        Alternatively, you may supply a value which indicates that
c        you will provide your own function to perform sub-pixel
c        interpolation by means of the "finterp " parameter. Again, see
f        you will provide your own routine to perform sub-pixel
f        interpolation by means of the FINTERP argument. Again, see
*        the "Sub-Pixel Interpolation Schemes" section below for
*        details.
c     finterp
f     FINTERP = SUBROUTINE (Given)
c        If the value given for the "interp" parameter indicates that
c        you will provide your own function for sub-pixel
c        interpolation, then a pointer to that function should be
c        given here. For details of the interface which the function
c        should have (several are possible, depending on the value of
c        "interp"), see the "Sub-Pixel Interpolation Schemes" section
c        below.
f        If the value given for the INTERP argument indicates that you
f        will provide your own routine for sub-pixel interpolation,
f        then the name of that routine should be given here (the name
f        should also appear in a Fortran EXTERNAL statement in the
f        routine which invokes AST_RESAMPLE<X>). For details of the
f        interface which the routine should have (several are
f        possible, depending on the value of INTERP), see the
f        "Sub-Pixel Interpolation Schemes" section below.
*
c        If the "interp" parameter has any other value, corresponding
c        to one of the pre-defined interpolation schemes, then this
c        function will not be used and you may supply a NULL pointer.
f        If the INTERP argument has any other value, corresponding to
f        one of the pre-defined interpolation schemes, then this
f        routine will not be used and you may supply the null routine
f        AST_NULL here (note only one underscore).  No EXTERNAL
f        statement is required for this routine, so long as the AST_PAR
f        include file has been used.
c     params
f     PARAMS( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
c        An optional pointer to an array of double which should contain
f        An optional array which should contain
*        any additional parameter values required by the sub-pixel
*        interpolation scheme. If such parameters are required, this
*        will be noted in the "Sub-Pixel Interpolation Schemes"
c        section below (you may also use this array to pass values
c        to your own interpolation function).
f        section below (you may also use this array to pass values
f        to your own interpolation routine).
*
c        If no additional parameters are required, this array is not
c        used and a NULL pointer may be given.
f        If no additional parameters are required, this array is not
f        used. A dummy (e.g. one-element) array may then be supplied.
c     flags
f     FLAGS = INTEGER (Given)
c        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which may be used to
f        The sum of a set of flag values which may be used to
*        provide additional control over the resampling operation. See
*        the "Control Flags" section below for a description of the
*        options available.  If no flag values are to be set, a value
*        of zero should be given.
c     tol
f     TOL = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may be
*        introduced as a result of approximating non-linear Mappings
*        by a set of piece-wise linear transformations. This should be
*        expressed as a displacement in pixels in the input grid's
*        coordinate system.
*
*        If piece-wise linear approximation is not required, a value
*        of zero may be given. This will ensure that the Mapping is
*        used without any approximation, but may increase execution
*        time.
c     maxpix
f     MAXPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        A value which specifies an initial scale size (in pixels) for
*        the adaptive algorithm which approximates non-linear Mappings
*        with piece-wise linear transformations. Normally, this should
*        be a large value (larger than any dimension of the region of
*        the output grid being used). In this case, a first attempt to
*        approximate the Mapping by a linear transformation will be
*        made over the entire output region.
*
*        If a smaller value is used, the output region will first be
c        divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed "maxpix"
f        divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed MAXPIX
*        pixels in any dimension. Only at this point will attempts at
*        approximation commence.
*
*        This value may occasionally be useful in preventing false
*        convergence of the adaptive algorithm in cases where the
*        Mapping appears approximately linear on large scales, but has
*        irregularities (e.g. holes) on smaller scales. A value of,
*        say, 50 to 100 pixels can also be employed as a safeguard in
*        general-purpose software, since the effect on performance is
*        minimal.
*
*        If too small a value is given, it will have the effect of
*        inhibiting linear approximation altogether (equivalent to
c        setting "tol" to zero). Although this may degrade
f        setting TOL to zero). Although this may degrade
*        performance, accurate results will still be obtained.
c     badval
f     BADVAL = <Xtype> (Given)
*        This argument should have the same type as the elements of
c        the "in" array. It specifies the value used to flag missing
f        the IN array. It specifies the value used to flag missing
*        data (bad pixels) in the input and output arrays.
*
c        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set via the "flags" parameter,
f        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set via the FLAGS argument,
c        then this value is used to test for bad pixels in the "in"
c        (and "in_var") array(s).
f        then this value is used to test for bad pixels in the IN
f        (and IN_VAR) array(s).
*
c        Unless the AST__NOBAD flag is set via the "flags" parameter,
f        Unless the AST__NOBAD flag is set via the FLAGS argument,
*        this value is also used to flag any output
c        elements in the "out" (and "out_var") array(s) for which
f        elements in the OUT (and OUT_VAR) array(s) for which
*        resampled values could not be obtained (see the "Propagation
*        of Missing Data" section below for details of the
c        circumstances under which this may occur). The astResample<X>
f        circumstances under which this may occur). The AST_RESAMPLE<X>
*        function return value indicates whether any such values have
*        been produced. If the AST__NOBAD flag is set. then output array
*        elements for which no resampled value could be obtained are
*        left set to the value they had on entry to this function.
c     ndim_out
f     NDIM_OUT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
*        at least one. It need not necessarily be equal to the number
*        of dimensions in the input grid.
c     lbnd_out
f     LBND_OUT( NDIM_OUT ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the first pixel
*        in the output grid along each dimension.
c     ubnd_out
f     UBND_OUT( NDIM_OUT ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the last pixel in
*        the output grid along each dimension.
*
c        Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the
f        Note that LBND_OUT and UBND_OUT together define the
*        shape, size and coordinate system of the output grid in the
c        same way as "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" define the shape, size
f        same way as LBND_IN and UBND_IN define the shape, size
*        and coordinate system of the input grid.
c     lbnd
f     LBND( NDIM_OUT ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the first pixel in the region
*        of the output grid for which a resampled value is to be
*        calculated.
c     ubnd
f     UBND( NDIM_OUT ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the last pixel in the region of
*        the output grid for which a resampled value is to be
*        calculated.
*
c        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" together define the shape and
f        Note that LBND and UBND together define the shape and
*        position of a (hyper-)rectangular region of the output grid
*        for which resampled values should be produced. This region
*        should lie wholly within the extent of the output grid (as
c        defined by the "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" arrays). Regions of
f        defined by the LBND_OUT and UBND_OUT arrays). Regions of
*        the output grid lying outside this region will not be
*        modified.
c     out
f     OUT( * ) = <Xtype> (Returned)
c        Pointer to an array, with one element for each pixel in the
f        An array, with one element for each pixel in the
*        output grid, into which the resampled data values will be
*        returned. The numerical type of this array should match that
c        of the "in" array, and the data storage order should be such
f        of the IN array, and the data storage order should be such
*        that the index of the first grid dimension varies most
*        rapidly and that of the final dimension least rapidly
c        (i.e. Fortran array indexing is used).
f        (i.e. normal Fortran array storage order).
c     out_var
f     OUT_VAR( * ) = <Xtype> (Returned)
c        An optional pointer to an array with the same type and size
c        as the "out" array. If given, this array will be used to
c        return variance estimates for the resampled data values. This
c        array will only be used if the "in_var" array has also been
c        supplied.
f        An optional array with the same type and size as the OUT
f        array. If the AST__USEVAR flag is set via the FLAGS argument,
f        this array will be used to return variance estimates for the
f        resampled data values.
*
*        The output variance values will be calculated on the
*        assumption that errors on the input data values are
*        statistically independent and that their variance estimates
*        may simply be summed (with appropriate weighting factors)
*        when several input pixels contribute to an output data
*        value. If this assumption is not valid, then the output error
*        estimates may be biased. In addition, note that the
*        statistical errors on neighbouring output data values (as
*        well as the estimates of those errors) may often be
*        correlated, even if the above assumption about the input data
*        is correct, because of the sub-pixel interpolation schemes
*        employed.
*
c        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
c        should be given.
f        If the AST__USEVAR flag is not set, no output variance
f        estimates will be calculated and this array will not be
f        used. A dummy (e.g. one-element) array may then be supplied.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astResample<X>()
f     AST_RESAMPLE<X> = INTEGER
*        The number of output pixels for which no valid resampled value
*        could be obtained. Thus, in the absence of any error, a returned
*        value of zero indicates that all the required output pixels
*        received valid resampled data values (and variances). See the
c        "badval" and "flags" parameters.
f        BADVAL and FLAGS arguments.

*  Notes:
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Data Type Codes:
*     To select the appropriate resampling function, you should
c     replace <X> in the generic function name astResample<X> with a
f     replace <X> in the generic function name AST_RESAMPLE<X> with a
*     1- or 2-character data type code, so as to match the numerical
*     type <Xtype> of the data you are processing, as follows:
c     - D: double
c     - F: float
c     - L: long int (may be 32 or 64 bit)
c     - K: 64 bit int
c     - UL: unsigned long int (may be 32 or 64 bit)
c     - UK: unsigned 64 bit int
c     - I: int
c     - UI: unsigned int
c     - S: short int
c     - US: unsigned short int
c     - B: byte (signed char)
c     - UB: unsigned byte (unsigned char)
f     - D: DOUBLE PRECISION
f     - R: REAL
f     - I: INTEGER
f     - UI: INTEGER (treated as unsigned)
f     - S: INTEGER*2 (short integer)
f     - US: INTEGER*2 (short integer, treated as unsigned)
f     - B: BYTE (treated as signed)
f     - UB: BYTE (treated as unsigned)
*
c     For example, astResampleD would be used to process "double"
c     data, while astResampleS would be used to process "short int"
c     data, etc.
f     For example, AST_RESAMPLED would be used to process DOUBLE
f     PRECISION data, while AST_RESAMPLES would be used to process
f     short integer data (stored in an INTEGER*2 array), etc.

*  Sub-Pixel Interpolation Schemes:
*     There is no such thing as a perfect sub-pixel interpolation
*     scheme and, in practice, all resampling will result in some
*     degradation of gridded data.  A range of schemes is therefore
*     provided, from which you can choose the one which best suits
*     your needs.
*
*     In general, a balance must be struck between schemes which tend
*     to degrade sharp features in the data by smoothing them, and
*     those which attempt to preserve sharp features. The latter will
*     often tend to introduce unwanted oscillations, typically visible
*     as "ringing" around sharp features and edges, especially if the
*     data are under-sampled (i.e. if the sharpest features are less
*     than about two pixels across). In practice, a good interpolation
*     scheme is likely to be a compromise and may exhibit some aspects
*     of both these features.
*
*     For under-sampled data, some interpolation schemes may appear to
*     preserve data resolution because they transform single input
*     pixels into single output pixels, rather than spreading their
*     data between several output pixels. While this may look
*     better cosmetically, it can result in a geometrical shift of
*     sharp features in the data. You should beware of this if you
*     plan to use such features (e.g.) for image alignment.
*
*     The following are two easy-to-use sub-pixel interpolation
*     schemes which are generally applicable. They are selected by
c     supplying the appropriate value (defined in the "ast.h" header
c     file) via the "interp" parameter. In these cases, the "finterp"
c     and "params" parameters are not used:
f     supplying the appropriate value (defined in the AST_PAR include
f     file) via the INTERP argument. In these cases, the FINTERP
f     and PARAMS arguments are not used:
*
*     - AST__NEAREST: This is the simplest possible scheme, in which
*     the value of the input pixel with the nearest centre to the
*     interpolation point is used. This is very quick to execute and
*     will preserve single-pixel features in the data, but may
*     displace them by up to half their width along each dimension. It
*     often gives a good cosmetic result, so is useful for quick-look
*     processing, but is unsuitable if accurate geometrical
*     transformation is required.
*     - AST__LINEAR: This is the default scheme, which uses linear
*     interpolation between the nearest neighbouring pixels in the
*     input grid (there are two neighbours in one dimension, four
*     neighbours in two dimensions, eight in three dimensions,
*     etc.). It is superior to the nearest-pixel scheme (above) in not
*     displacing features in the data, yet it still executes fairly
*     rapidly. It is generally a safe choice if you do not have any
*     particular reason to favour another scheme, since it cannot
*     introduce oscillations. However, it does introduce some spatial
*     smoothing which varies according to the distance of the
*     interpolation point from the neighbouring pixels. This can
*     degrade the shape of sharp features in the data in a
*     position-dependent way. It may also show in the output variance
*     grid (if used) as a pattern of stripes or fringes.
*
*     An alternative set of interpolation schemes is based on forming
*     the interpolated value from the weighted sum of a set of
*     surrounding pixel values (not necessarily just the nearest
*     neighbours). This approach has its origins in the theory of
*     digital filtering, in which interpolated values are obtained by
*     conceptually passing the sampled data (represented by a grid of
*     delta functions) through a linear filter which implements a
*     convolution. Because the convolution kernel is continuous, the
*     convolution yields a continuous function which may then be
*     evaluated at fractional pixel positions. The (possibly
*     multi-dimensional) kernel is usually regarded as "separable" and
*     formed from the product of a set of identical 1-dimensional
*     kernel functions, evaluated along each dimension. Different
*     interpolation schemes are then distinguished by the choice of
*     this 1-dimensional interpolation kernel. The number of
*     surrounding pixels which contribute to the result may also be
*     varied.
*
*     From a practical standpoint, it is useful to divide the weighted
*     sum of pixel values by the sum of the weights when determining
*     the interpolated value.  Strictly, this means that a true
*     convolution is no longer being performed. However, the
*     distinction is rarely important in practice because (for
*     slightly subtle reasons) the sum of weights is always
*     approximately constant for good interpolation kernels. The
*     advantage of this technique, which is used here, is that it can
*     easily accommodate missing data and tends to minimise unwanted
*     oscillations at the edges of the data grid.
*
*     In the following schemes, which are based on a 1-dimensional
c     interpolation kernel, the first element of the "params" array
f     interpolation kernel, the first element of the PARAMS array
*     should be used to specify how many pixels are to contribute to the
*     interpolated result on either side of the interpolation point in
*     each dimension (the nearest integer value is used). Execution time
*     increases rapidly with this number. Typically, a value of 2 is
*     appropriate and the minimum value used will be 1 (i.e. two pixels
*     altogether, one on either side of the interpolation point).
c     A value of zero or less may be given for "params[0]"
f     A value of zero or less may be given for PARAMS(1)
*     to indicate that a suitable number of pixels should be calculated
*     automatically.
*
c     In each of these cases, the "finterp" parameter is not used:
f     In each of these cases, the FINTERP argument is not used:
*
*     - AST__GAUSS: This scheme uses a kernel of the form exp(-k*x*x), with
*     k a positive constant. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is
*     given by
c     "params[1]"
f     PARAMS(2)
f     value, which should be at least 0.1 (in addition, setting PARAMS(1)
*     to zero will select the number of contributing pixels so as to utilise
*     the width of the kernel out to where the envelope declines to 1% of its
*     maximum value). This kernel suppresses noise at the expense of
*     smoothing the output array.
*     - AST__SINC: This scheme uses a sinc(pi*x) kernel, where x is the
*     pixel offset from the interpolation point and sinc(z)=sin(z)/z. This
*     sometimes features as an "optimal" interpolation kernel in books on
*     image processing. Its supposed optimality depends on the assumption
*     that the data are band-limited (i.e. have no spatial frequencies above
*     a certain value) and are adequately sampled. In practice, astronomical
*     data rarely meet these requirements. In addition, high spatial
*     frequencies are often present due (e.g.) to image defects and cosmic
*     ray events. Consequently, substantial ringing can be experienced with
*     this kernel. The kernel also decays slowly with distance, so that
*     many surrounding pixels are required, leading to poor performance.
*     Abruptly truncating it, by using only a few neighbouring pixels,
c     improves performance and may reduce ringing (if "params[0]" is set to
f     improves performance and may reduce ringing (if PARAMS(1) is set to
*     zero, then only two pixels will be used on either side). However, a
*     more gradual truncation, as implemented by other kernels, is generally
*     to be preferred. This kernel is provided mainly so that you can
*     convince yourself not to use it!
*     - AST__SINCSINC: This scheme uses an improved kernel, of the form
*     sinc(pi*x).sinc(k*pi*x), with k a constant, out to the point where
*     sinc(k*pi*x) goes to zero, and zero beyond. The second sinc() factor
*     provides an "envelope" which gradually rolls off the normal sinc(pi*x)
*     kernel at large offsets. The width of this envelope is specified by
*     giving the number of pixels offset at which it goes to zero by means
c     of the "params[1]" value, which should be at least 1.0 (in addition,
c     setting "params[0]" to zero will select the number of contributing
f     of the PARAMS(2) value, which should be at least 1.0 (in addition,
f     setting PARAMS(1) to zero will select the number of contributing
*     pixels so as to utilise the full width of the kernel, out to where it
c     reaches zero). The case given by "params[0]=2, params[1]=2" is typically
f     reaches zero). The case given by PARAMS(1)=2, PARAMS(2)=2 is typically
*     a good choice and is sometimes known as the Lanczos kernel. This is a
*     valuable general-purpose interpolation scheme, intermediate in its
*     visual effect on images between the AST__NEAREST and AST__LINEAR
*     schemes. Although the kernel is slightly oscillatory, ringing is
*     adequately suppressed if the data are well sampled.
*     - AST__SINCCOS: This scheme uses a kernel of the form
*     sinc(pi*x).cos(k*pi*x), with k a constant, out to the point where
*     cos(k*pi*x) goes to zero, and zero beyond. As above, the cos() factor
*     provides an envelope which gradually rolls off the sinc() kernel
*     at large offsets. The width of this envelope is specified by giving
*     the number of pixels offset at which it goes to zero by means
c     of the "params[1]" value, which should be at least 1.0 (in addition,
c     setting "params[0]" to zero will select the number of contributing
f     of the PARAMS(2) value, which should be at least 1.0 (in addition,
f     setting PARAMS(1) to zero will select the number of contributing
*     pixels so as to utilise the full width of the kernel, out to where it
*     reaches zero). This scheme gives similar results to the
*     AST__SINCSINC scheme, which it resembles.
*     - AST__SINCGAUSS: This scheme uses a kernel of the form
*     sinc(pi*x).exp(-k*x*x), with k a positive constant. Here, the sinc()
*     kernel is rolled off using a Gaussian envelope which is specified by
c     giving its full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) by means of the "params[1]"
c     value, which should be at least 0.1 (in addition, setting "params[0]"
f     giving its full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) by means of the PARAMS(2)
f     value, which should be at least 0.1 (in addition, setting PARAMS(1)
*     to zero will select the number of contributing pixels so as to utilise
*     the width of the kernel out to where the envelope declines to 1% of its
*     maximum value). On astronomical images and spectra, good results are
*     often obtained by approximately matching the FWHM of the
c     envelope function, given by "params[1]", to the point spread function
f     envelope function, given by PARAMS(2), to the point spread function
*     of the input data. However, there does not seem to be any theoretical
*     reason for this.
*     - AST__SOMB: This scheme uses a somb(pi*x) kernel (a "sombrero"
*     function), where x is the pixel offset from the interpolation point
*     and somb(z)=2*J1(z)/z  (J1 is a Bessel function of the first kind of
*     order 1). It is similar to the AST__SINC kernel, and has the same
*     parameter usage.
*     - AST__SOMBCOS: This scheme uses a kernel of the form
*     somb(pi*x).cos(k*pi*x), with k a constant, out to the point where
*     cos(k*pi*x) goes to zero, and zero beyond. It is similar to the
*     AST__SINCCOS kernel, and has the same parameter usage.
*
*     In addition, the following schemes are provided which are not based
*     on a 1-dimensional kernel:
*
*     - AST__BLOCKAVE: This scheme simply takes an average of all the
*     pixels on the input grid in a cube centred on the interpolation
*     point.  The number of pixels in the cube is determined by the
c     value of the first element of the "params" array, which gives
f     value of the first element of the PARAMS array, which gives
*     the number of pixels in each dimension on either side of the
c     central point.  Hence a block of (2 * params[0])^ndim_in
f     central point.  Hence a block of (2 * PARAMS(1))**NDIM_IN
*     pixels in the input grid will be examined to determine the
*     value of the output pixel.  If the variance is not being used
c     (var_in or var_out = NULL) then all valid pixels in this cube
f     (USEVAR = .FALSE.) then all valid pixels in this cube
*     will be averaged in to the result with equal weight.
*     If variances are being used, then each input pixel will be
*     weighted proportionally to the reciprocal of its variance; any
*     pixel without a valid variance will be discarded.  This scheme
*     is suitable where the output grid is much coarser than the
*     input grid; if the ratio of pixel sizes is R then a suitable
c     value of params[0] may be R/2.
f     value of PARAMS(1) may be R/2.
*
c     Finally, supplying the following values for "interp" allows you
c     to implement your own sub-pixel interpolation scheme by means of
c     your own function. You should supply a pointer to this function
c     via the "finterp" parameter:
f     Finally, supplying the following values for INTERP allows you to
f     implement your own sub-pixel interpolation scheme by means of
f     your own routine. You should supply the name of this routine via
f     the FINTERP argument:
*
c     - AST__UKERN1: In this scheme, you supply a function to evaluate
c     your own 1-dimensional interpolation kernel, which is then used
c     to perform sub-pixel interpolation (as described above). The
c     function you supply should have the same interface as the
c     fictitious astUkern1 function (q.v.).  In addition, a value
c     should be given via "params[0]" to specify the number of
c     neighbouring pixels which are to contribute to each interpolated
c     value (in the same way as for the pre-defined interpolation
c     schemes described above). Other elements of the "params" array
c     are available to pass values to your interpolation function.
f     - AST__UKERN1: In this scheme, you supply a routine to evaluate
f     your own 1-dimensional interpolation kernel, which is then used
f     to perform sub-pixel interpolation (as described above). The
f     routine you supply should have the same interface as the
f     fictitious AST_UKERN1 routine (q.v.).  In addition, a value
f     should be given via PARAMS(1) to specify the number of
f     neighbouring pixels which are to contribute to each interpolated
f     value (in the same way as for the pre-defined interpolation
f     schemes described above). Other elements of the PARAMS array
f     are available to pass values to your interpolation routine.
*
c     - AST__UINTERP: This is a completely general scheme, in which
c     your interpolation function has access to all of the input
c     data. This allows you to implement any interpolation algorithm
c     you choose, which could (for example) be non-linear, or
c     adaptive. In this case, the astResample<X> functions play no
c     role in the sub-pixel interpolation process and simply handle
c     the geometrical transformation of coordinates and other
c     housekeeping. The function you supply should have the same
c     interface as the fictitious astUinterp function (q.v.). In this
c     case, the "params" parameter is not used by astResample<X>, but
c     is available to pass values to your interpolation function.
f     - AST__UINTERP: This is a completely general scheme, in which
f     your interpolation routine has access to all of the input
f     data. This allows you to implement any interpolation algorithm
f     you choose, which could (for example) be non-linear, or
f     adaptive. In this case, the AST_RESAMPLE<X> functions play no
f     role in the sub-pixel interpolation process and simply handle
f     the geometrical transformation of coordinates and other
f     housekeeping. The routine you supply should have the same
f     interface as the fictitious AST_UINTERP routine (q.v.). In this
f     case, the PARAMS argument is not used by AST_RESAMPLE<X>, but
f     is available to pass values to your interpolation routine.

*  Control Flags:
c     The following flags are defined in the "ast.h" header file and
f     The following flags are defined in the AST_PAR include file and
*     may be used to provide additional control over the resampling
*     process. Having selected a set of flags, you should supply the
c     bitwise OR of their values via the "flags" parameter:
f     sum of their values via the FLAGS argument:
*
*     - AST__NOBAD: Indicates that any output array elements for which no
*     resampled value could be obtained should be left set to the value
*     they had on entry to this function. If this flag is not supplied,
*     such output array elements are set to the value supplied for
c     parameter "badval". Note, this flag cannot be used in conjunction
f     argument BADVAL. Note, this flag cannot be used in conjunction
*     with the AST__CONSERVEFLUX flag (an error will be reported if both
*     flags are specified).
*     - AST__URESAMP1, 2, 3 & 4: A set of four flags which are
*     reserved for your own use. They may be used to pass private
c     information to any sub-pixel interpolation function which you
f     information to any sub-pixel interpolation routine which you
*     implement yourself. They are ignored by all the pre-defined
*     interpolation schemes.
*     - AST__USEBAD: Indicates that there may be bad pixels in the
*     input array(s) which must be recognised by comparing with the
c     value given for "badval" and propagated to the output array(s).
f     value given for BADVAL and propagated to the output array(s).
*     If this flag is not set, all input values are treated literally
c     and the "badval" value is only used for flagging output array
f     and the BADVAL value is only used for flagging output array
*     values.
f     - AST__USEVAR: Indicates that variance information should be
f     processed in order to provide estimates of the statistical error
f     associated with the resampled values. If this flag is not set,
f     no variance processing will occur and the IN_VAR and OUT_VAR
f     arrays will not be used. (Note that this flag is only available
f     in the Fortran interface to AST.)
*     - AST__CONSERVEFLUX: Indicates that the output pixel values should
*     be scaled in such a way as to preserve (approximately) the total data
*     value in a feature on the sky. Without this flag, each output pixel
*     value represents an instantaneous sample of the input data values at
*     the corresponding input position. This is appropriate if the input
*     data represents the spatial density of some quantity (e.g. surface
*     brightness in Janskys per square arc-second) because the output
*     pixel values will have the same normalisation and units as the
*     input pixel values. However, if the input data values represent
*     flux (or some other physical quantity) per pixel, then the
*     AST__CONSERVEFLUX flag could be used. This causes each output
*     pixel value to be scaled by the ratio of the output pixel size to
*     the input pixel size.
*
*     This flag can only be used if the Mapping is successfully approximated
*     by one or more linear transformations. Thus an error will be reported
*     if it used when the
c     "tol" parameter
f     TOL argument
*     is set to zero (which stops the use of linear approximations), or
*     if the Mapping is too non-linear to be approximated by a piece-wise
*     linear transformation. The ratio of output to input pixel size is
*     evaluated once for each panel of the piece-wise linear approximation to
*     the Mapping, and is assumed to be constant for all output pixels in the
*     panel. The scaling factors for adjacent panels will in general
*     differ slightly, and so the joints between panels may be visible when
*     viewing the output image at high contrast. If this is a problem,
*     reduce the value of the
c     "tol" parameter
f     TOL argument
*     until the difference between adjacent panels is sufficiently small
*     to be insignificant.
*
*     Note, this flag cannot be used in conjunction with the AST__NOBAD
*     flag (an error will be reported if both flags are specified).

*  Propagation of Missing Data:
*     Unless the AST__NOBAD flag is specified, instances of missing data
*     (bad pixels) in the output grid are
c     identified by occurrences of the "badval" value in the "out"
f     identified by occurrences of the BADVAL value in the OUT
*     array. These may be produced if any of the following happen:
*
*     - The input position (the transformed position of the output
*     pixel's centre) lies outside the boundary of the grid of input
*     pixels.
*     - The input position lies inside the boundary of a bad input
*     pixel. In this context, an input pixel is considered bad if its
c     data value is equal to "badval" and the AST__USEBAD flag is
c     set via the "flags" parameter.
f     data value is equal to BADVAL and the AST__USEBAD flag is
f     set via the FLAGS argument.
*     (Positions which have half-integral coordinate values, and
*     therefore lie on a pixel boundary, are regarded as lying within
*     the pixel with the larger, i.e. more positive, index.)
*     - The set of neighbouring input pixels (excluding those which
*     are bad) is unsuitable for calculating an interpolated
*     value. Whether this is true may depend on the sub-pixel
*     interpolation scheme in use.
*     - The interpolated value lies outside the range which can be
c     represented using the data type of the "out" array.
f     represented using the data type of the OUT array.
*
*     In addition, associated output variance estimates (if
c     calculated) may be declared bad and flagged with the "badval"
c     value in the "out_var" array under any of the following
f     calculated) may be declared bad and flagged with the BADVAL
f     value in the OUT_VAR array under any of the following
*     circumstances:
*
c     - The associated resampled data value (in the "out" array) is bad.
f     - The associated resampled data value (in the OUT array) is bad.
*     - The set of neighbouring input pixels which contributed to the
*     output data value do not all have valid variance estimates
*     associated with them. In this context, an input variance
*     estimate may be regarded as bad either because it has the value
c     "badval" (and the AST__USEBAD flag is set), or because it is
f     BADVAL (and the AST__USEBAD flag is set), or because it is
*     negative.
*     - The set of neighbouring input pixels for which valid variance
*     values are available is unsuitable for calculating an overall
*     variance value. Whether this is true may depend on the sub-pixel
*     interpolation scheme in use.
*     - The variance value lies outside the range which can be
c     represented using the data type of the "out_var" array.
f     represented using the data type of the OUT_VAR array.
*
*     If the AST__NOBAD flag is specified via
c     parameter "flags",
f     argument FLAGS,
*     then output array elements that would otherwise be set to
c     "badval"
f     BADVAL
*     are instead left holding the value they had on entry to this
*     function. The number of such array elements is returned as
*     the function value.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This function resamples a rectangular grid of data (with any
*     number of dimensions) into a specified section of another
*     rectangular grid (with a possibly different number of
*     dimensions). The coordinate transformation used to convert
*     output pixel coordinates into positions in the input grid is
*     given by the inverse transformation of the Mapping which is
*     supplied.  Any pixel interpolation scheme may be specified for
*     interpolating between the pixels of the input grid.
*
*     This function is very similar to ResampleWithBlocking and
*     ResampleSection which lie below it in the calling
*     hierarchy. However, this function also attempts to adapt to the
*     Mapping supplied and to sub-divide the section being resampled
*     into smaller sections within which a linear approximation to the
*     Mapping may be used.  This reduces the number of Mapping
*     evaluations, thereby improving efficiency particularly when
*     complicated Mappings are involved.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Mapping, whose inverse transformation may be
*        used to transform the coordinates of pixels in the output
*        grid into associated positions in the input grid, from which
*        the output pixel values should be derived (by interpolation
*        if necessary).
*
*        The number of input coordintes for the Mapping (Nin
*        attribute) should match the value of "ndim_in" (below), and
*        the number of output coordinates (Nout attribute) should
*        match the value of "ndim_out".
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the input data grid, its extent along a
*        particular (i'th) dimension being (ubnd_in[i] - lbnd_in[i] +
*        1). They also define the input grid's coordinate system, with
*        each pixel being of unit extent along each dimension with
*        integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the input array of data to be resampled (with one
*        element for each pixel in the input grid). The numerical type
*        of these data should match the "type" value (below). The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and data type as the "in" array),
*        which represent estimates of the statistical variance
*        associated with each element of the "in" array. If this
*        second array is given (along with the corresponding "out_var"
*        array), then estimates of the variance of the resampled data
*        will also be returned.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     type
*        A value taken from the "DataType" enum, which specifies the
*        data type of the input and output arrays containing the
*        gridded data (and variance) values.
*     interp
*        A value selected from a set of pre-defined macros to identify
*        which sub-pixel interpolation algorithm should be used.
*     finterp
*        If "interp" is set to a value which requires a user-supplied
*        function, then a pointer to that function shoild be given
*        here. Otherwise, this value is not used and may be a NULL
*        pointer.
*     params
*        Pointer to an optional array of parameters that may be passed
*        to the interpolation algorithm, if required. If no parameters
*        are required, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which provide
*        additional control over the resampling operation.
*     tol
*        The maximum permitted positional error in transforming output
*        pixel positions into the input grid in order to resample
*        it. This should be expressed as a displacement in pixels in
*        the input grid's coordinate system. If the Mapping's inverse
*        transformation can be approximated by piecewise linear
*        functions to this accuracy, then such functions may be used
*        instead of the Mapping in order to improve
*        performance. Otherwise, every output pixel position will be
*        transformed individually using the Mapping.
*
*        If linear approximation is not required, a "tol" value of
*        zero may be given. This will ensure that the Mapping is used
*        without any approximation.
*     maxpix
*        A value which specifies the largest scale size on which to
*        search for non-linearities in the Mapping supplied. This
*        value should be expressed as a number of pixels in the output
*        grid. The function will break the output section specified
*        into smaller sub-sections (if necessary), each no larger than
*        "maxpix" pixels in any dimension, before it attempts to
*        approximate the Mapping by a linear function over each
*        sub-section.
*
*        If the value given is larger than the largest dimension of
*        the output section (the normal recommendation), the function
*        will initially search for non-linearity on a scale determined
*        by the size of the output section.  This is almost always
*        satisfactory. Very occasionally, however, a Mapping may
*        appear linear on this scale but nevertheless have smaller
*        irregularities (e.g. "holes") in it.  In such cases, "maxpix"
*        may be set to a suitably smaller value so as to ensure this
*        non-linearity is not overlooked. Typically, a value of 50 to
*        100 pixels might be suitable and should have little effect on
*        performance.
*
*        If too small a value is given, however, it will have the
*        effect of preventing linear approximation occurring at all
*        (equivalent to setting "tol" to zero).  Although this may
*        degrade performance, accurate results will still be obtained.
*     badval_ptr
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set (above), this parameter is a
*        pointer to a value which is used to identify bad data and/or
*        variance values in the input array(s). The referenced value's
*        data type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. Unless the AST__NOBAD flag is set, the same value will
*        also be used to flag any output array elements for which
*        resampled values could not be obtained.  The output arrays(s)
*        may be flagged with this value whether or not the AST__USEBAD
*        flag is set (the function return value indicates whether any
*        such values have been produced).
*     ndim_out
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
*        at least one.
*     lbnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the shape
*        and size of the output data grid in the same way as "lbnd_in"
*        and "ubnd_in" define the shape and size of the input grid
*        (see above).
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the first pixel in the
*        section of the output data grid for which a value is
*        required.
*     ubnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the last pixel in the
*        section of the output data grid for which a value is
*        required.
*
*        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" define the shape and position of
*        the section of the output grid for which resampled values are
*        required. This section should lie wholly within the extent of
*        the output grid (as defined by the "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out"
*        arrays). Regions of the output grid lying outside this section
*        will not be modified.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the resampled data will be returned.  The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the resampled values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given.
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.

*  Returned Value:
*     The number of output grid points for which no valid output value
*     could be obtained.

*  Notes:
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Name:

*                          void *out, void *out_var )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This function resamples a rectangular grid of data (with any
*     number of dimensions) into a specified section of another
*     rectangular grid (with a possibly different number of
*     dimensions). The coordinate transformation used is given by the
*     inverse transformation of the Mapping which is supplied or,
*     alternatively, by a linear approximation fitted to a Mapping's
*     inverse transformation. Any pixel interpolation scheme may be
*     specified for interpolating between the pixels of the input
*     grid.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Mapping, whose inverse transformation may be
*        used to transform the coordinates of pixels in the output
*        grid into associated positions in the input grid, from which
*        the output pixel values should be derived (by interpolation
*        if necessary).
*
*        The number of input coordintes for the Mapping (Nin
*        attribute) should match the value of "ndim_in" (below), and
*        the number of output coordinates (Nout attribute) should
*        match the value of "ndim_out".
*     linear_fit
*        Pointer to an optional array of double which contains the
*        coefficients of a linear fit which approximates the above
*        Mapping's inverse coordinate transformation. If this is
*        supplied, it will be used in preference to the above Mapping
*        when transforming coordinates. This may be used to enhance
*        performance in cases where evaluation of the Mapping's
*        inverse transformation is expensive. If no linear fit is
*        available, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*
*        The way in which the fit coefficients are stored in this
*        array and the number of array elements are as defined by the
*        astLinearApprox function.
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the input data grid, its extent along a
*        particular (i'th) dimension being (ubnd_in[i] - lbnd_in[i] +
*        1). They also define the input grid's coordinate system, with
*        each pixel being of unit extent along each dimension with
*        integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the input array of data to be resampled (with one
*        element for each pixel in the input grid). The numerical type
*        of these data should match the "type" value (below). The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and data type as the "in" array),
*        which represent estimates of the statistical variance
*        associated with each element of the "in" array. If this
*        second array is given (along with the corresponding "out_var"
*        array), then estimates of the variance of the resampled data
*        will also be returned.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     type
*        A value taken from the "DataType" enum, which specifies the
*        data type of the input and output arrays containing the
*        gridded data (and variance) values.
*     interp
*        A value selected from a set of pre-defined macros to identify
*        which sub-pixel interpolation algorithm should be used.
*     finterp
*        If "interp" is set to a value which requires a user-supplied
*        function, then a pointer to that function shoild be given
*        here. Otherwise, this value is not used and may be a NULL
*        pointer.
*     params
*        Pointer to an optional array of parameters that may be passed
*        to the interpolation algorithm, if required. If no parameters
*        are required, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*     factor
*        A factor by which to scale the resampled output data values before
*        returning them. If flux is being conserved this should be set to
*        the ratio of the output pixel size to the input pixel size in the
*        section. Otherwise it should be set to 1.0.
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which provide
*        additional control over the resampling operation.
*     badval_ptr
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set (above), this parameter is a
*        pointer to a value which is used to identify bad data and/or
*        variance values in the input array(s). The referenced value's
*        data type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. Unless the AST__NOBAD flag is set, the same value will
*        also be used to flag any output array elements for which
*        resampled values could not be obtained.  The output arrays(s)
*        may be flagged with this value whether or not the AST__USEBAD
*        flag is set (the function return value indicates whether any
*        such values have been produced).
*     ndim_out
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
*        at least one.
*     lbnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the shape
*        and size of the output data grid in the same way as "lbnd_in"
*        and "ubnd_in" define the shape and size of the input grid
*        (see above).
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the first pixel in the
*        section of the output data grid for which a value is
*        required.
*     ubnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the last pixel in the
*        section of the output data grid for which a value is
*        required.
*
*        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" define the shape and position of
*        the section of the output grid for which resampled values are
*        required. This section should lie wholly within the extent of
*        the output grid (as defined by the "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out"
*        arrays). Regions of the output grid lying outside this section
*        will not be modified.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the resampled data will be returned.  The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the resampled values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given.
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.

*  Returned Value:
*       The number of output grid points for which no valid output value
*       could be obtained.

*  Notes:
*     - This function does not take steps to limit memory usage if the
*     grids supplied are large. To resample large grids in a more
*     memory-efficient way, the ResampleWithBlocking function should
*     be used.
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This function resamples a rectangular grid of data (with any
*     number of dimensions) into a specified section of another
*     rectangular grid (with a possibly different number of
*     dimensions). The coordinate transformation used is given by the
*     inverse transformation of the Mapping which is supplied or,
*     alternatively, by a linear approximation fitted to a Mapping's
*     inverse transformation. Any pixel interpolation scheme may be
*     specified for interpolating between the pixels of the input
*     grid.
*
*     This function is very similar to ResampleSection, except that in
*     order to limit memory usage and to ensure locality of reference,
*     it divides the output grid up into "blocks" which have a limited
*     extent along each output dimension. Each block, which will not
*     contain more than a pre-determined maximum number of pixels, is
*     then passed to ResampleSection for resampling.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Mapping, whose inverse transformation may be
*        used to transform the coordinates of pixels in the output
*        grid into associated positions in the input grid, from which
*        the output pixel values should be derived (by interpolation
*        if necessary).
*
*        The number of input coordintes for the Mapping (Nin
*        attribute) should match the value of "ndim_in" (below), and
*        the number of output coordinates (Nout attribute) should
*        match the value of "ndim_out".
*     linear_fit
*        Pointer to an optional array of double which contains the
*        coefficients of a linear fit which approximates the above
*        Mapping's inverse coordinate transformation. If this is
*        supplied, it will be used in preference to the above Mapping
*        when transforming coordinates. This may be used to enhance
*        performance in cases where evaluation of the Mapping's
*        inverse transformation is expensive. If no linear fit is
*        available, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*
*        The way in which the fit coefficients are stored in this
*        array and the number of array elements are as defined by the
*        astLinearApprox function.
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the input data grid, its extent along a
*        particular (i'th) dimension being (ubnd_in[i] - lbnd_in[i] +
*        1). They also define the input grid's coordinate system, with
*        each pixel being of unit extent along each dimension with
*        integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the input array of data to be resampled (with one
*        element for each pixel in the input grid). The numerical type
*        of these data should match the "type" value (below). The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and data type as the "in" array),
*        which represent estimates of the statistical variance
*        associated with each element of the "in" array. If this
*        second array is given (along with the corresponding "out_var"
*        array), then estimates of the variance of the resampled data
*        will also be returned.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     type
*        A value taken from the "DataType" enum, which specifies the
*        data type of the input and output arrays containing the
*        gridded data (and variance) values.
*     interp
*        A value selected from a set of pre-defined macros to identify
*        which sub-pixel interpolation algorithm should be used.
*     finterp
*        If "interp" is set to a value which requires a user-supplied
*        function, then a pointer to that function shoild be given
*        here. Otherwise, this value is not used and may be a NULL
*        pointer.
*     params
*        Pointer to an optional array of parameters that may be passed
*        to the interpolation algorithm, if required. If no parameters
*        are required, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which provide
*        additional control over the resampling operation.
*     badval_ptr
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set (above), this parameter is a
*        pointer to a value which is used to identify bad data and/or
*        variance values in the input array(s). The referenced value's
*        data type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. Unless the AST__NOBAD flag is set, the same value will
*        also be used to flag any output array elements for which
*        resampled values could not be obtained.  The output arrays(s)
*        may be flagged with this value whether or not the AST__USEBAD
*        flag is set (the function return value indicates whether any
*        such values have been produced).
*     ndim_out
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
*        at least one.
*     lbnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the output data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the shape
*        and size of the output data grid in the same way as "lbnd_in"
*        and "ubnd_in" define the shape and size of the input grid
*        (see above).
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the first pixel in the
*        section of the output data grid for which a value is
*        required.
*     ubnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the last pixel in the
*        section of the output data grid for which a value is
*        required.
*
*        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" define the shape and position of
*        the section of the output grid for which resampled values are
*        required. This section should lie wholly within the extent of
*        the output grid (as defined by the "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out"
*        arrays). Regions of the output grid lying outside this section
*        will not be modified.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the resampled data will be returned.  The
*        storage order should be such that the coordinate of the first
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order is used).
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the resampled values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given.
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     The number of output grid points for which no valid output value
*     could be obtained.

*  Notes:
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Synopsis:

c     AstMapping *astSimplify( AstMapping *this )
f     RESULT = AST_SIMPLIFY( THIS, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping method.

*  Description:
*     This function simplifies a Mapping (which may be a compound
*     Mapping such as a CmpMap) to eliminate redundant computational
*     steps, or to merge separate steps which can be performed more
*     efficiently in a single operation.
*
*     As a simple example, a Mapping which multiplied coordinates by
*     5, and then multiplied the result by 10, could be simplified to
*     a single step which multiplied by 50. Similarly, a Mapping which
*     multiplied by 5, and then divided by 5, could be reduced to a
*     simple copying operation.
*
*     This function should typically be applied to Mappings which have
*     undergone substantial processing or have been formed by merging
*     other Mappings. It is of potential benefit, for example, in
*     reducing execution time if applied before using a Mapping to
*     transform a large number of coordinates.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the original Mapping.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astSimplify()
f     AST_SIMPLIFY = INTEGER
*        A new pointer to the (possibly simplified) Mapping.

*  Applicability:
*     Mapping
*        This function applies to all Mappings.
*     FrameSet
*        If the supplied Mapping is a FrameSet, the returned Mapping
*        will be a copy of the supplied FrameSet in which all the
*        inter-Frame Mappings have been simplified.

*  Notes:
*     - Mappings that have a set value for their Ident attribute are
*     left unchanged after simplification. This is so that their
*     individual identity is preserved. This restriction does not
*     apply to the simplification of Frames.
*     - This function can safely be applied even to Mappings which
*     cannot be simplified. If no simplification is possible, it
c     behaves exactly like astClone and returns a pointer to the
f     behaves exactly like AST_CLONE and returns a pointer to the
*     original Mapping.
*     - The Mapping returned by this function may not be independent
*     of the original (even if simplification was possible), and
*     modifying it may therefore result in indirect modification of
*     the original. If a completely independent result is required, a
c     copy should be made using astCopy.
f     copy should be made using AST_COPY.
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This is a set of functions which rebins a rectangular region of an
*     input grid of data (and, optionally, associated statistical variance
*     values) so as to place them into a new output grid. Each input
*     grid point may be mapped on to a position in the output grid in
*     an arbitrary way. The input and output grids may have any number
*     of dimensions, not necessarily equal.
*
*     Where the input positions given do not correspond with a pixel centre
*     in the output grid, the each input pixel value is spread out between the
*     surrounding output pixels using weights determined by a separable kernel
*     which is the product of a 1-dimensional kernel function evaluated along
*     each output dimension. A pointer should be supplied to the 1-dimensional
*     kernel function to be used.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Mapping being used in the rebinning operation
*        (this is only used for constructing error messages).
*     ndim_out
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the output grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the output grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the shape
*        and size of the output grid, its extent along a particular
*        (i'th) dimension being ubnd_out[i]-lbnd_out[i]+1 (assuming "i"
*        is zero-based). They also define the output grid's coordinate
*        system, with each pixel being of unit extent along each
*        dimension with integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the array of data to be rebinned. The numerical type
*        of these data should match the function used, as given by the
*        suffix on the function name. Note that details of how the input
*        grid maps on to this array (e.g. the storage order, number of
*        dimensions, etc.) is arbitrary and is specified entirely by means
*        of the "offset" array. The "in" array should therefore contain
*        sufficient elements to accommodate the "offset" values supplied.
*        There is no requirement that all elements of the "in" array
*        should be rebinned, and any which are not addressed by the
*        contents of the "offset" array will be ignored.
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and type as the "in" array), which
*        represent estimates of the statistical variance associated
*        with each element of the "in" array. If this second array is
*        given (along with the corresponding "out_var" array), then
*        estimates of the variance of the resampled data will also be
*        returned. It is addressed in exactly the same way (via the
*        "offset" array) as the "in" array.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     infac
*        A factor by which to multiply the input data values before use.
*     npoint
*        The number of input points which are to be rebinned.
*     offset
*        Pointer to an array of integers with "npoint" elements. For
*        each input point, this array should contain the zero-based
*        offset in the input array(s) (i.e. the "in" and, optionally,
*        the "in_var" arrays) from which the value to be rebinned should
*        be obtained.
*     coords
*        An array of pointers to double, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        Element "coords[coord]" should point at the first element of
*        an array of double (with "npoint" elements) which contains the
*        values of coordinate number "coord" for each point being
*        rebinned. The value of coordinate number "coord" for
*        rebinning point number "point" is therefore given by
*        "coords[coord][point]" (assuming both indices are
*        zero-based).  If any point has a coordinate value of AST__BAD
*        associated with it, then the corresponding input data (and
*        variance) value will be ignored.
*     kernel
*        Pointer to the 1-dimensional kernel function to be used.
*     neighb
*        The number of neighbouring pixels in each dimension (on each
*        side of the interpolation position) which are to receive
*        contributions from the input pixel value. This value should be at
*        least 1.
*     params
*        Pointer to an optional array of parameter values to be passed
*        to the kernel function. If no parameters are required by this
*        function, then a NULL pointer may be supplied.
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which control the
*        operation of the function. These are chosend from:
*
*        - AST__USEBAD: indicates whether there are "bad" (i.e. missing) data
*        in the input array(s) which must be recognised.  If this flag is not
*        set, all input values are treated literally.
*        - AST__GENVAR: Indicates that output variances should be generated
*        from the spread of values contributing to each output pixel.
*        - AST__USEVAR: Indicates that output variances should be generated
*        by rebinning the input variances.
*        - AST__VARWGT: Indicates that input variances should be used to
*        create weights for the input data values.
*
*        Only one of AST__GENVAR and AST__USEVAR should be supplied.
*     badval
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set in the "flags" value (above),
*        this parameter specifies the value which is used to identify
*        bad data and/or variance values in the input array(s). Its
*        numerical type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. The same value will also be used to flag any output
*        array elements for which resampled values could not be
*        obtained.  The output arrays(s) may be flagged with this
*        value whether or not the AST__USEBAD flag is set (the
*        function return value indicates whether any such values have
*        been produced).
*     npix_out
*        Number of pixels in output array.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the rebinned data will be returned. The
*        storage order should be such that the index of the first grid
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order).
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the rebinned values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given. The values returned
*        are estimates of the statistical variance of the corresponding
*        values in the "out" array, on the assumption that all errors in
*        input grid values (in the "in" array) are statistically independent
*        and that their variance estimates (in the "in_var" array) may
*        simply be summed (with appropriate weighting factors).
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.
*     work
*        A pointer to an array with the same data type and size as the "out"
*        array which is used as work space. The values in the supplied
*        array are incremented on exit by the sum of the weights used
*        with each output pixel.
*     nused
*        An optional pointer to a int64_t which will be incremented by the
*        number of input values pasted into the output array. Ignored if NULL.

*  Notes:
*     - There is a separate function for each numerical type of
*     gridded data, distinguished by replacing the <X> in the function
*     name by the appropriate 1- or 2-character suffix.

*  Name:
*     SpreadLinear<X>

*  Purpose:
*     Rebin a data grid, using the linear spreading scheme.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "mapping.h"
*     void SpreadLinear<X>( int ndim_out,
*                           const int *lbnd_out, const int *ubnd_out,
*                           const <Xtype> *in, const <Xtype> *in_var,
*                           double infac, int npoint, const int *offset,
*                           const double *const *coords, int flags,
*                           <Xtype> badval, int npix_out, <Xtype> *out,
*                           <Xtype> *out_var, double *work, int64_t *nused  )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This is a set of functions which rebins a rectangular region of an
*     input grid of data (and, optionally, associated statistical variance
*     values) so as to place them into a new output grid. Each input
*     grid point may be mapped on to a position in the output grid in
*     an arbitrary way. Where the positions given do not correspond
*     with a pixel centre in the input grid, the spreading scheme
*     used divides the input pixel value up linearly between the
*     nearest neighbouring output pixels in each dimension (there are 2
*     nearest neighbours in 1 dimension, 4 in 2 dimensions, 8 in 3
*     dimensions, etc.).

*  Parameters:
*     ndim_out
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the output grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the output grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the shape
*        and size of the output grid, its extent along a particular
*        (i'th) dimension being ubnd_out[i]-lbnd_out[i]+1 (assuming "i"
*        is zero-based). They also define the output grid's coordinate
*        system, with each pixel being of unit extent along each
*        dimension with integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the array of data to be rebinned. The numerical type
*        of these data should match the function used, as given by the
*        suffix on the function name. Note that details of how the input
*        grid maps on to this array (e.g. the storage order, number of
*        dimensions, etc.) is arbitrary and is specified entirely by means
*        of the "offset" array. The "in" array should therefore contain
*        sufficient elements to accommodate the "offset" values supplied.
*        There is no requirement that all elements of the "in" array
*        should be rebinned, and any which are not addressed by the
*        contents of the "offset" array will be ignored.
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and type as the "in" array), which
*        represent estimates of the statistical variance associated
*        with each element of the "in" array. If this second array is
*        given (along with the corresponding "out_var" array), then
*        estimates of the variance of the resampled data will also be
*        returned. It is addressed in exactly the same way (via the
*        "offset" array) as the "in" array.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     infac
*        A factor by which to multiply the input data values before use.
*     npoint
*        The number of input points which are to be rebinned.
*     offset
*        Pointer to an array of integers with "npoint" elements. For
*        each input point, this array should contain the zero-based
*        offset in the input array(s) (i.e. the "in" and, optionally,
*        the "in_var" arrays) from which the value to be rebinned should
*        be obtained.
*     coords
*        An array of pointers to double, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        Element "coords[coord]" should point at the first element of
*        an array of double (with "npoint" elements) which contains the
*        values of coordinate number "coord" for each point being
*        rebinned. The value of coordinate number "coord" for
*        rebinning point number "point" is therefore given by
*        "coords[coord][point]" (assuming both indices are
*        zero-based).  If any point has a coordinate value of AST__BAD
*        associated with it, then the corresponding input data (and
*        variance) value will be ignored.
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which control the
*        operation of the function. These are chosend from:
*
*        - AST__USEBAD: indicates whether there are "bad" (i.e. missing) data
*        in the input array(s) which must be recognised.  If this flag is not
*        set, all input values are treated literally.
*        - AST__GENVAR: Indicates that any input variances are to be
*        ignored, and that the output variances should be generated from
*        the spread of values contributing to each output pixel.
*     badval
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set in the "flags" value (above),
*        this parameter specifies the value which is used to identify
*        bad data and/or variance values in the input array(s). Its
*        numerical type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. The same value will also be used to flag any output
*        array elements for which resampled values could not be
*        obtained.  The output arrays(s) may be flagged with this
*        value whether or not the AST__USEBAD flag is set (the
*        function return value indicates whether any such values have
*        been produced).
*     npix_out
*        Number of pixels in output array.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the rebinned data will be returned. The
*        storage order should be such that the index of the first grid
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order).
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the rebinned values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given. The values returned
*        are estimates of the statistical variance of the corresponding
*        values in the "out" array, on the assumption that all errors in
*        input grid values (in the "in" array) are statistically independent
*        and that their variance estimates (in the "in_var" array) may
*        simply be summed (with appropriate weighting factors).
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.
*     work
*        An optional pointer to a double array with the same size as
*        the "out" array. The contents of this array (if supplied) are
*        incremented by the accumulated weights assigned to each output pixel.
*        If no accumulated weights are required, a NULL pointer should be
*        given.
*     nused
*        An optional pointer to a int64_t which will be incremented by the
*        number of input values pasted into the output array. Ignored if NULL.

*  Notes:
*     - There is a separate function for each numerical type of
*     gridded data, distinguished by replacing the <X> in the function
*     name by the appropriate 1- or 2-character suffix.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This is a set of functions which rebins a rectangular region of an
*     input grid of data (and, optionally, associated statistical variance
*     values) so as to place them into a new output grid. Each input
*     grid point may be mapped on to a position in the output grid in
*     an arbitrary way. Where the positions given do not correspond
*     with a pixel centre in the output grid, the spreading scheme
*     used is simply to select the nearest pixel (i.e. the one whose
*     bounds contain the supplied position).

*  Parameters:
*     ndim_out
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the output grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_out
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the output grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the shape
*        and size of the output grid, its extent along a particular
*        (i'th) dimension being ubnd_out[i]-lbnd_out[i]+1 (assuming "i"
*        is zero-based). They also define the output grid's coordinate
*        system, with each pixel being of unit extent along each
*        dimension with integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     in
*        Pointer to the array of data to be rebinned. The numerical type
*        of these data should match the function used, as given by the
*        suffix on the function name. Note that details of how the input
*        grid maps on to this array (e.g. the storage order, number of
*        dimensions, etc.) is arbitrary and is specified entirely by means
*        of the "offset" array. The "in" array should therefore contain
*        sufficient elements to accommodate the "offset" values supplied.
*        There is no requirement that all elements of the "in" array
*        should be rebinned, and any which are not addressed by the
*        contents of the "offset" array will be ignored.
*     in_var
*        An optional pointer to a second array of positive numerical
*        values (with the same size and type as the "in" array), which
*        represent estimates of the statistical variance associated
*        with each element of the "in" array. If this second array is
*        given (along with the corresponding "out_var" array), then
*        estimates of the variance of the resampled data will also be
*        returned. It is addressed in exactly the same way (via the
*        "offset" array) as the "in" array.
*
*        If no variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer should
*        be given.
*     infac
*        A factor by which to multiply the input data values before use.
*     npoint
*        The number of input points which are to be rebinned.
*     offset
*        Pointer to an array of integers with "npoint" elements. For
*        each input point, this array should contain the zero-based
*        offset in the input array(s) (i.e. the "in" and, optionally,
*        the "in_var" arrays) from which the value to be rebinned should
*        be obtained.
*     coords
*        An array of pointers to double, with "ndim_out" elements.
*        Element "coords[coord]" should point at the first element of
*        an array of double (with "npoint" elements) which contains the
*        values of coordinate number "coord" for each point being
*        rebinned. The value of coordinate number "coord" for
*        rebinning point number "point" is therefore given by
*        "coords[coord][point]" (assuming both indices are
*        zero-based).  If any point has a coordinate value of AST__BAD
*        associated with it, then the corresponding input data (and
*        variance) value will be ignored.
*     flags
*        The bitwise OR of a set of flag values which control the
*        operation of the function. These are chosend from:
*
*        - AST__USEBAD: indicates whether there are "bad" (i.e. missing) data
*        in the input array(s) which must be recognised.  If this flag is not
*        set, all input values are treated literally.
*        - AST__GENVAR: Indicates that output variances should be generated
*        from the spread of values contributing to each output pixel.
*        - AST__USEVAR: Indicates that output variances should be generated
*        by rebinning the input variances.
*        - AST__VARWGT: Indicates that input variances should be used to
*        create weights for the input data values.
*
*        Only one of AST__GENVAR and AST__USEVAR should be supplied.
*     badval
*        If the AST__USEBAD flag is set in the "flags" value (above),
*        this parameter specifies the value which is used to identify
*        bad data and/or variance values in the input array(s). Its
*        numerical type must match that of the "in" (and "in_var")
*        arrays. The same value will also be used to flag any output
*        array elements for which resampled values could not be
*        obtained.  The output arrays(s) may be flagged with this
*        value whether or not the AST__USEBAD flag is set (the
*        function return value indicates whether any such values have
*        been produced).
*     npix_out
*        Number of pixels in output array.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with the same data type as the "in"
*        array, into which the rebinned data will be returned. The
*        storage order should be such that the index of the first grid
*        dimension varies most rapidly and that of the final dimension
*        least rapidly (i.e. Fortran array storage order).
*     out_var
*        An optional pointer to an array with the same data type and
*        size as the "out" array, into which variance estimates for
*        the rebinned values may be returned. This array will only be
*        used if the "in_var" array has been given. The values returned
*        are estimates of the statistical variance of the corresponding
*        values in the "out" array, on the assumption that all errors in
*        input grid values (in the "in" array) are statistically independent
*        and that their variance estimates (in the "in_var" array) may
*        simply be summed (with appropriate weighting factors).
*
*        If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
*        should be given.
*     work
*        A pointer to an array with the same data type and size as the "out"
*        array which is used as work space. The values in the supplied
*        array are incremented on exit by the sum of the weights used
*        with each output pixel.
*     nused
*        An optional pointer to a size_t which will be incremented by the
*        number of input values pasted into the output array. Ignored if NULL.

*  Notes:
*     - There is a separate function for each numerical type of
*     gridded data, distinguished by replacing the <X> in the function
*     name by the appropriate 1- or 2-character suffix.

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping method.

*  Description:
*     This function uses the supplied Mapping to transforms a regular square
*     grid of points covering a specified box. It attempts to do this
*     quickly by first approximating the Mapping with a linear transformation
*     applied over the whole region of the input grid which is being used.
*     If this proves to be insufficiently accurate, the input region is
*     sub-divided into two along its largest dimension and the process is
*     repeated within each of the resulting sub-regions. This process of
*     sub-division continues until a sufficiently good linear approximation
*     is found, or the region to which it is being applied becomes too small
*     (in which case the original Mapping is used directly).

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Mapping to be applied.
c     ncoord_in
f     NCOORD_IN = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of coordinates being supplied for each box corner
*        (i.e. the number of dimensions of the space in which the
*        input points reside).
c     lbnd
f     LBND( NCOORD_IN ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ncoord_in" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the first pixel
*        in the input grid along each dimension.
c     ubnd
f     UBND( NCOORD_IN ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ncoord_in" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the last pixel in
*        the input grid along each dimension.
*
c        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" together define the shape
f        Note that LBND and UBND together define the shape
*        and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
c        (j'th) dimension being ubnd[j]-lbnd[j]+1 (assuming the
c        index "j" to be zero-based). They also define
f        (J'th) dimension being UBND(J)-LBND(J)+1. They also define
*        the input grid's coordinate system, each pixel having unit
*        extent along each dimension with integral coordinate values
*        at its centre.
c     tol
f     TOL = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
*        The maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may be
*        introduced as a result of approximating non-linear Mappings
*        by a set of piece-wise linear transformations. This should be
*        expressed as a displacement within the output coordinate system
*        of the Mapping.
*
*        If piece-wise linear approximation is not required, a value
*        of zero may be given. This will ensure that the Mapping is
*        used without any approximation, but may increase execution
*        time.
*
*        If the value is too high, discontinuities between the linear
*        approximations used in adjacent panel will be higher. If this
*        is a problem, reduce the tolerance value used.
c     maxpix
f     MAXPIX = INTEGER (Given)
*        A value which specifies an initial scale size (in input grid points)
*        for the adaptive algorithm which approximates non-linear Mappings
*        with piece-wise linear transformations. Normally, this should
*        be a large value (larger than any dimension of the region of
*        the input grid being used). In this case, a first attempt to
*        approximate the Mapping by a linear transformation will be
*        made over the entire input region.
*
*        If a smaller value is used, the input region will first be
c        divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed "maxpix"
f        divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed MAXPIX
*        grid points in any dimension. Only at this point will attempts
*        at approximation commence.
*
*        This value may occasionally be useful in preventing false
*        convergence of the adaptive algorithm in cases where the
*        Mapping appears approximately linear on large scales, but has
*        irregularities (e.g. holes) on smaller scales. A value of,
*        say, 50 to 100 grid points can also be employed as a safeguard
*        in general-purpose software, since the effect on performance is
*        minimal.
*
*        If too small a value is given, it will have the effect of
*        inhibiting linear approximation altogether (equivalent to
c        setting "tol" to zero). Although this may degrade
f        setting TOL to zero). Although this may degrade
*        performance, accurate results will still be obtained.
c     forward
f     FORWARD = LOGICAL (Given)
c        A non-zero value indicates that the Mapping's forward
c        coordinate transformation is to be applied, while a zero
c        value indicates that the inverse transformation should be
c        used.
f        A .TRUE. value indicates that the Mapping's forward
f        coordinate transformation is to be applied, while a .FALSE.
f        value indicates that the inverse transformation should be
f        used.
c     ncoord_out
f     NCOORD_OUT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of coordinates being generated by the Mapping for
*        each output point (i.e. the number of dimensions of the
*        space in which the output points reside). This need not be
c        the same as "ncoord_in".
f        the same as NCOORD_IN.
c     outdim
f     OUTDIM = INTEGER (Given)
c        The number of elements along the second dimension of the "out"
f        The number of elements along the first dimension of the OUT
*        array (which will contain the output coordinates). The value
*        given should not be less than the number of points in the grid.
c     out
f     OUT( OUTDIM, NCOORD_OUT ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
c        The address of the first element in a 2-dimensional array of
c        shape "[ncoord_out][outdim]", into
c        which the coordinates of the output (transformed) points will
c        be written. These will be stored such that the value of
c        coordinate number "coord" for output point number "point"
c        will be found in element "out[coord][point]".
f        An array into which the coordinates of the output
f        (transformed) points will be written. These will be stored
f        such that the value of coordinate number COORD for output
f        point number POINT will be found in element OUT(POINT,COORD).
*        The points are ordered such that the first axis of the input
*        grid changes most rapidly. For example, if the input grid is
*        2-dimensional and extends from (2,-1) to (3,1), the output
*        points will be stored in the order (2,-1), (3, -1), (2,0), (3,0),
*        (2,1), (3,1).
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Notes:
c     - If the forward coordinate transformation is being applied, the
c     Mapping supplied must have the value of "ncoord_in" for its Nin
c     attribute and the value of "ncoord_out" for its Nout attribute. If
c     the inverse transformation is being applied, these values should
c     be reversed.
f     - If the forward coordinate transformation is being applied, the
f     Mapping supplied must have the value of NCOORD_IN for its Nin
f     attribute and the value of NCOORD_OUT for its Nout attribute. If
f     the inverse transformation is being applied, these values should
f     be reversed.

*                              double *out[] )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This function transforms grid points within a specified section of a
*     rectangular grid (with any number of dimensions) using the forward
*     transformation of the specified Mapping.
*
*     This function is very similar to TranGridWithBlocking and TranGridSection
*     which lie below it in the calling hierarchy. However, this function
*     also attempts to adapt to the Mapping supplied and to sub-divide the
*     section being transformed into smaller sections within which a linear
*     approximation to the Mapping may be used.  This reduces the number of
*     Mapping evaluations, thereby improving efficiency particularly when
*     complicated Mappings are involved.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Mapping to be applied. The forward transformation
*        is used.
*     ncoord_in
*        The number of coordinates being supplied for each box corner
*        (i.e. the number of dimensions of the space in which the
*        input points reside).
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the whole input grid, its extent along a
*        particular (i'th) dimension being (ubnd_in[i] - lbnd_in[i] +
*        1). They also define the input grid's coordinate system, with
*        each pixel being of unit extent along each dimension with
*        integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ncoord_in" elements,
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the first pixel
*        in the input grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ncoord_in" elements,
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the last pixel in
*        the input grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" together define the shape
*        and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
*        (j'th) dimension being ubnd[j]-lbnd[j]+1 (assuming the
*        index "j" to be zero-based). They also define
*        the input grid's coordinate system, each pixel having unit
*        extent along each dimension with integral coordinate values
*        at its centre.
*     tol
*        The maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may be
*        introduced as a result of approximating non-linear Mappings
*        by a set of piece-wise linear transformations. This should be
*        expressed as a displacement in pixels in the output grid's
*        coordinate system.
*
*        If piece-wise linear approximation is not required, a value
*        of zero may be given. This will ensure that the Mapping is
*        used without any approximation, but may increase execution
*        time.
*
*        If the value is too high, discontinuities between the linear
*        approximations used in adjacent panel will be higher. If this
*        is a problem, reduce the tolerance value used.
*     maxpix
*        A value which specifies an initial scale size (in grid points)
*        for the adaptive algorithm which approximates non-linear Mappings
*        with piece-wise linear transformations. Normally, this should
*        be a large value (larger than any dimension of the region of
*        the input grid being used). In this case, a first attempt to
*        approximate the Mapping by a linear transformation will be
*        made over the entire input region.
*
*        If a smaller value is used, the input region will first be
*        divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed "maxpix"
*        grid points in any dimension. Only at this point will attempts
*        at approximation commence.
*
*        This value may occasionally be useful in preventing false
*        convergence of the adaptive algorithm in cases where the
*        Mapping appears approximately linear on large scales, but has
*        irregularities (e.g. holes) on smaller scales. A value of,
*        say, 50 to 100 grid points can also be employed as a safeguard
*        in general-purpose software, since the effect on performance is
*        minimal.
*
*        If too small a value is given, it will have the effect of
*        inhibiting linear approximation altogether (equivalent to
*        setting "tol" to zero). Although this may degrade
*        performance, accurate results will still be obtained.
*     ncoord_out
*        The number of dimensions of the space in which the output points
*        reside.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with "ndim_out" elements. Element [i] of
*        this array is a pointer to an array in which to store the
*        transformed values for output axis "i". The points are ordered
*        such that the first axis of the input grid changes most rapidly.
*        For example, if the input grid is 2-dimensional and extends from
*        (2,-1) to (3,1), the output points will be stored in the order
*        (2,-1), (3, -1), (2,0), (3,0), (2,1), (3,1).

*  Name:

*  Purpose:
*     Transform grid points within a section of a rectangular grid.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "mapping.h"
*     void TranGridSection( AstMapping *this, const double *linear_fit,
*                           int ndim_in, const int *lbnd_in,

*                           const int *ubnd, int ndim_out, double *out[] )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This function transforms grid points within a specified section of a
*     rectangular grid (with any number of dimensions) using a specified
*     Mapping or, alternatively, a linear approximation fitted to the
*     Mapping's forward transformation.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Mapping, whose forward transformation may be
*        used to transform the coordinates of points in the input
*        grid.
*
*        The number of input coordintes for the Mapping (Nin
*        attribute) should match the value of "ndim_in" (below), and
*        the number of output coordinates (Nout attribute) should
*        match the value of "ndim_out".
*     linear_fit
*        Pointer to an optional array of double which contains the
*        coefficients of a linear fit which approximates the above
*        Mapping's forward coordinate transformation. If this is
*        supplied, it will be used in preference to the above Mapping
*        when transforming coordinates. This may be used to enhance
*        performance in cases where evaluation of the Mapping's
*        forward transformation is expensive. If no linear fit is
*        available, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*
*        The way in which the fit coefficients are stored in this
*        array and the number of array elements are as defined by the
*        astLinearApprox function.
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input data grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the input data grid, its extent along a
*        particular (i'th) dimension being (ubnd_in[i] - lbnd_in[i] +
*        1). They also define the input grid's coordinate system, with
*        each pixel being of unit extent along each dimension with
*        integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the first pixel in the
*        section of the input data grid which is to be rebinned.
*     ubnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the last pixel in the
*        section of the input data grid which is to be rebinned.
*
*        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" define the shape and position of
*        the section of the input grid which is to be rebinned. This section
*        should lie wholly within the extent of the input grid (as defined
*        by the "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" arrays). Regions of the input
*        grid lying outside this section will be ignored.
*     ndim_out
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
*        at least one.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with "ndim_out" elements. Element [i] of
*        this array is a pointer to an array in which to store the
*        transformed values for output axis "i". The points are ordered
*        such that the first axis of the input grid changes most rapidly.
*        For example, if the input grid is 2-dimensional and extends from
*        (2,-1) to (3,1), the output points will be stored in the order
*        (2,-1), (3, -1), (2,0), (3,0), (2,1), (3,1).

*  Notes:
*     - This function does not take steps to limit memory usage if the
*     grids supplied are large. To resample large grids in a more
*     memory-efficient way, the ResampleWithBlocking function should
*     be used.

/*
*  Name:
*     TranGridWithBlocking

*  Purpose:
*     Transforms positions in a section of a grid in a memory-efficient way.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "mapping.h"
*     void TranGridWithBlocking( AstMapping *this, const double *linear_fit,
*                                int ndim_in, const int *lbnd_in,
*                                const int *ubnd_in, const int *lbnd,
*                                const int *ubnd, int ndim_out,
*                                double *out[], int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping member function.

*  Description:
*     This function transforms positions within a specified section of a
*     rectangular grid (with any number of dimensions) using the forward
*     transformation of the supplied Mapping.
*
*     This function is very similar to TranGridSection, except that in
*     order to limit memory usage and to ensure locality of reference,
*     it divides the input grid up into "blocks" which have a limited
*     extent along each input dimension. Each block, which will not
*     contain more than a pre-determined maximum number of pixels, is
*     then passed to TranGridSection for transformation.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a Mapping, whose forward transformation may be
*        used to transform the coordinates of pixels in the input
*        grid into associated positions in the output grid.
*
*        The number of input coordintes for the Mapping (Nin
*        attribute) should match the value of "ndim_in" (below), and
*        the number of output coordinates (Nout attribute) should
*        match the value of "ndim_out".
*     linear_fit
*        Pointer to an optional array of double which contains the
*        coefficients of a linear fit which approximates the above
*        Mapping's forward coordinate transformation. If this is
*        supplied, it will be used in preference to the above Mapping
*        when transforming coordinates. This may be used to enhance
*        performance in cases where evaluation of the Mapping's
*        forward transformation is expensive. If no linear fit is
*        available, a NULL pointer should be supplied.
*
*        The way in which the fit coefficients are stored in this
*        array and the number of array elements are as defined by the
*        astLinearApprox function.
*     ndim_in
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the first
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the centre of the last
*        pixel in the input grid along each dimension.
*
*        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
*        and size of the whole input grid, its extent along a
*        particular (i'th) dimension being (ubnd_in[i] - lbnd_in[i] +
*        1). They also define the input grid's coordinate system, with
*        each pixel being of unit extent along each dimension with
*        integral coordinate values at its centre.
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the first pixel in the
*        section of the input data grid which is to be transformed.
*     ubnd
*        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements.
*        This should give the coordinates of the last pixel in the
*        section of the input data grid which is to be transformed.
*
*        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" define the shape and position of the
*        section of the input grid which is to be transformed.
*     ndim_out
*        The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
*        at least one.
*     out
*        Pointer to an array with "ndim_out" elements. Element [i] of
*        this array is a pointer to an array in which to store the
*        transformed values for output axis "i". The points are ordered
*        such that the first axis of the input grid changes most rapidly.
*        For example, if the input grid is 2-dimensional and extends from
*        (2,-1) to (3,1), the output points will be stored in the order
*        (2,-1), (3, -1), (2,0), (3,0), (2,1), (3,1).
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

c     - If the forward coordinate transformation is being applied, the
c     Mapping supplied must have the value of "ncoord_in" for its Nin
c     attribute and the value of "ncoord_out" for its Nout attribute. If
c     the inverse transformation is being applied, these values should
c     be reversed.

*  Description:
*     This function applies a Mapping to transform the coordinates of

*
*     If the coordinates are stored in a single (2-dimensional) array,

*     npoint
*        The number of points to be transformed.
*     ncoord_in

*        input points reside).
*     ptr_in
*        An array of pointers to double, with "ncoord_in"
*        elements. Element "ptr_in[coord]" should point at the first
*        element of an array of double (with "npoint" elements) which
*        contain the values of coordinate number "coord" for each
*        input (untransformed) point. The value of coordinate number
*        "coord" for input point number "point" is therefore given by
*        "ptr_in[coord][point]" (assuming both indices are
*        zero-based).
*     forward
*        A non-zero value indicates that the Mapping's forward
*        coordinate transformation is to be applied, while a zero
*        value indicates that the inverse transformation should be
*        used.
*     ncoord_out
*        The number of coordinates being generated by the Mapping for
*        each output point (i.e. the number of dimensions of the space
*        in which the output points reside). This need not be the same
*        as "ncoord_in".
*     ptr_out
*        An array of pointers to double, with "ncoord_out"
*        elements. Element "ptr_out[coord]" should point at the first
*        element of an array of double (with "npoint" elements) into

*        (transformed) point will be written.  The value of coordinate

*        be found in "ptr_out[coord][point]".

*  Notes:
*     - If the forward coordinate transformation is being applied, the

*     points.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Mapping. The nature of the coordinate

*        supplied. Note that there is no constructor for the Mapping
*        class itself, so this object should be from a derived class.
*     in
*        Pointer to the PointSet holding the input coordinate data.
*     forward
*        A non-zero value indicates that the forward coordinate
*        transformation should be applied, while a zero value requests
*        the inverse transformation.
*     out
*        Pointer to a PointSet which will hold the transformed
*        (output) coordinate values. A NULL value may also be given,
*        in which case a new PointSet will be created by this
*        function.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to the output (possibly new) PointSet.

*  Notes:
*     - An error will result if the Mapping supplied does not define
*     the requested coordinate transformation (either forward or
*     inverse).
*     - The number of coordinate values per point in the input
*     PointSet must match the number of input coordinates for the
*     Mapping being applied (or number of output coordinates if the
*     inverse transformation is requested).
*     - If an output PointSet is supplied, it must have space for
*     sufficient number of points and coordinate values per point to
*     accommodate the result (e.g. the number of Mapping output
*     coordinates, or number of input coordinates if the inverse
*     transformation is requested). Any excess space will be ignored.
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Description:
c     This is a fictitious function which does not actually

c     you may implement a function with this interface for yourself
c     (and give it any name you wish). A pointer to such a function
c     may be passed via the "finterp" parameter of the astResample<X>
c     functions (q.v.) in order to perform sub-pixel interpolation
c     during resampling of gridded data (you must also set the
c     "interp" parameter of astResample<X> to the value
c     AST__UINTERP). This allows you to use your own interpolation
c     algorithm in addition to those which are pre-defined.
f     This is a fictitious routine which does not actually
f     exist. Instead, this description constitutes a template so that

f     may be passed via the FINTERP argument of the AST_RESAMPLE<X>

f     during resampling of gridded data (you must also set the
f     INTERP argument of AST_RESAMPLE<X> to the value
f     AST__UINTERP). This allows you to use your own interpolation
f     algorithm in addition to those which are pre-defined.

*        the input grid along each dimension.
*
c        Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape,
f        Note that LBND_IN and UBND_IN together define the shape,
*        size and coordinate system of the input grid in the same
c        way as they do in astResample<X>.
f        way as they do in AST_RESAMPLE<X>.
c     in
f     IN( * ) = <Xtype> (Given)
c        Pointer to an array, with one element for each pixel in the
f        An array, with one element for each pixel in the
*        input grid, containing the input data. This will be the same
c        array as was passed to astResample<X> via the "in" parameter.
f        array as was passed to AST_RESAMPLE<X> via the IN argument.
*        The numerical type of this array should match that of the
*        data being processed.
c     in_var
f     IN_VAR( * ) = <Xtype> (Given)
c        Pointer to an optional second array with the same size and
c        type as the "in" array. If given, this will contain the set

c        "in_var" parameter.
f        An optional second array with the same size and type as the

*
c        If no variance values are being processed, this will be a

f        If the AST__USEVAR flag is not set, then no variance values

c        "point" should be stored in "out[offset[point]]" (assuming
c        the index "point" is zero-based).
f        For each interpolation point, this array will contain the
f        offset from the start of the OUT (and OUT_VAR) array(s) at
f        which the interpolated value (and its variance, if required)
f        should be stored. For example, the interpolated value for

c        elements. Element "coords[coord]" will point at the first
c        element of an array of double (with "npoint" elements) which
c        contains the values of coordinate number "coord" for each
c        interpolation point. The value of coordinate number "coord"
c        for interpolation point number "point" is therefore given by
c        "coords[coord][point]" (assuming both indices are
c        zero-based).
f        A 2-dimensional array containing the coordinates of the
f        points at which interpolation should be performed. These will

f        to the value AST__BAD (as defined in the AST_PAR include

c        should either be set to the value given by "badval",
f        should either be set to the value given by BADVAL,

c        specified by "flags".
f        specified by FLAGS.
c     params
f     PARAMS( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)
c        This will be a pointer to the same array as was given via the

c        This will be the same value as was given via the "flags"
c        parameter of astResample<X>. You may test this value to
f        This will be the same value as was given via the FLAGS
f        argument of AST_RESAMPLE<X>. You may test this value to
*        provide additional control over the operation of your
*        resampling algorithm. Note that the special flag values
*        AST__URESAMP1, 2, 3 & 4 are reserved for you to use for your
*        own purposes and will not clash with other pre-defined flag
c        values (see astResample<X>).
f        values (see AST_RESAMPLE<X>).
c     badval
f     BADVAL = <Xtype> (Given)
c        This will be the same value as was given via the "badval"
c        parameter of astResample<X>, and will have the same numerical
c        type as the data being processed (i.e. as elements of the

c        "flags" parameter) and (unless the AST__NOBAD flag is set in
c        "flags") for identifying bad output values in
c        the "out" (and "out_var") array(s).
f        This will be the same value as was given for the BADVAL
f        argument of AST_RESAMPLE<X>, and will have the same numerical
f        type as the data being processed (i.e. as elements of the IN
f        array).  It should be used to test for bad pixels in the
f        input grid (but only if the AST__USEBAD flag is set via the
f        FLAGS argument) and (unless the AST__NOBAD flag is set in
f        FLAGS) for identifying bad output values in the OUT (and
f        OUT_VAR) array(s).
c     out
f     OUT( * ) = <Xtype> (Returned)
c        Pointer to an array with the same numerical type as the "in"
f        An array with the same numerical type as the IN

f        In general, not all elements of this array (or the OUT_VAR

*
c        If given, it is addressed in exactly the same way (via the
c        "offset" array) as the "out" array. The values returned
c        should be estimates of the statistical variance of the

c        independent and that their variance estimates may simply be

c     The function calculates the value of a 1-dimensional sub-pixel
f     The routine calculates the value of a 1-dimensional sub-pixel
*     interpolation kernel. This determines how the weight given to
*     neighbouring pixels in calculating an interpolated value depends
*     on the pixel's offset from the interpolation point. In more than
*     one dimension, the weight assigned to a pixel is formed by
*     evaluating this 1-dimensional kernel using the offset along each
*     dimension in turn. The product of the returned values is then
*     used as the pixel weight.

*  Parameters:
c     offset
f     OFFSET = DOUBLE PRECISION (Given)

f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - Not all functions make good interpolation kernels. In general,
*     acceptable kernels tend to be symmetrical about zero, to have a
*     positive peak (usually unity) at zero, and to evaluate to zero
*     whenever the pixel offset has any other integral value (this
*     ensures that the interpolated values pass through the original
*     data). An interpolation kernel may or may not have regions with
*     negative values. You should consult a good book on image
*     processing for more details.
c     - If an error occurs within this function, it should use
c     astSetStatus to set the AST error status to an error value.

*     function. The modification used allows the method to cope with
*     coordinate constraints and (equivalently) regions where the
*     function returns "bad" values. The method is robust and not
*     susceptible to overflow, so is suitable for applying to Mapping
*     functions of unknown form.

*  Parameters:
*     mapdata
*        Pointer to a MapData structure which describes the Mapping
*        function, its coordinate constraints, etc.
*     acc
*        The accuracy required in the value of the maximum.
*     maxcall
*        The maximum number of Mapping function evaluations to use.
*     dx
*        Pointer to an array of double containing an offset along each
*        input coordinate for the Mapping function supplied. These
*        offsets will be used to construct the initial simplex
*        (i.e. they are the initial "step lengths" for each
*        coordinate) and may be positive or negative.
*     xmax
*        Pointer to an array of double which contains the coordinates
*        of an initial estimate of the location of the maximum. On
*        exit, this will be updated to contain the best estimate of
*        the location of the maximum as generated by this function.
*     err
*        Pointer to a double in which to return an estimate of the
*        error in the value of the maximum found. For normal
*        convergence, this should be no larger than "acc". However, if
*        the maximum number of Mapping function evaluations is
*        reached, the returned value may be larger than this, although
*        it should still be valid. In such cases, re-starting the
*        algorithm at the new location returned in "xmax" may be
*        advisable.
*     ncall
*        Pointer to an int in which the number of Mapping function
*        evaluations will be returned.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     An estimate of the Mapping function value at the local maximum.

*  Notes:
*     - The function may return before the requested accuracy has been
*     met and before all Mapping function evaluations have been
*     made. This signifies that an excessive number of function values
*     have been needed outside the coordinate constraints. This is
*     only likely if the function is unable to make progress near such
*     a constraint, in which case the algorithm should probably be
*     re-started.
*     - A value of AST__BAD will be returned if no maximum could be
*     found.  This means that all the Mapping function evaluations
*     performed returned a value of AST__BAD.
*     - A value of AST__BAD will also be returned and no useful
*     information about a solution will be produced if this routine is
*     invoked with the global error status set, or if it should fail
*     for any reason.

*  Purpose:
*     Mapping inversion flag.

*  Type:
*     Public attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     Integer (boolean).

*  Description:
*     This attribute controls which one of a Mapping's two possible
*     coordinate transformations is considered the "forward"
*     transformation (the other being the "inverse"
*     transformation). If the attribute value is zero (the default),
*     the Mapping's behaviour will be the same as when it was first
*     created. However, if it is non-zero, its two transformations
*     will be inter-changed, so that the Mapping displays the inverse
*     of its original behaviour.
*
*     Inverting the boolean sense of the Invert attribute will cause
*     the values of a Mapping's Nin and Nout attributes to be
*     interchanged. The values of its TranForward and TranInverse
*     attributes will also be interchanged. This operation may be
c     performed with the astInvert function.
f     performed with the AST_INVERT routine.

*  Applicability:
*     Mapping
*        All Mappings have this attribute.
*     UnitMap
*        The value of the Invert attribute has no effect on the
*        behaviour of a UnitMap.
*     FrameSet
*        Inverting the boolean sense of the Invert attribute for a
*        FrameSet will cause its base and current Frames (and its Base
*        and Current attributes) to be interchanged. This, in turn,
*        may affect other properties and attributes of the FrameSet
*        (such as Nin, Nout, Naxes, TranForward, TranInverse,

*  Applicability:
*     Mapping
*        All Mappings have this attribute.
*     CmpMap
*        The IsLinear value for a CmpMap is determined by the classes
*        of the encapsulated Mappings. For instance, a CmpMap that combines
*        a ZoomMap and a ShiftMap will have a non-zero value for its IsLinear
*        attribute, but a CmpMap that contains a MathMap will have a
*        value of zero for its IsLinear attribute.
*     Frame
*        The IsLinear value for a Frame is 1 (since a Frame is equivalent
*        to a UnitMap).

*        The IsLinear value for a FrameSet is obtained from the Mapping

*     This attribute indicates whether a Mapping has been simplified
*     by the

f     AST_SIMPLIFY
*     method. If the IsSimple value is non-zero, then the Mapping has
*     been simplified and so there is nothing to be gained by simplifying
*     it again. Indeed, the
c     astSimplify
f     AST_SIMPLIFY
*     method will immediately return the Mapping unchanged if the IsSimple
*     attribute indicates that the Mapping has already been simplified.

*  Applicability:
*     Mapping
*        All Mappings have this attribute.
*     Frame
*        All classes of Frame return zero for the IsSimple attribute.
*        This is because changes can be made to a Frame which affect the
*        Mapping represented by the Frame, and so there can be no
*        guarantee that the Mapping may not need re-simplifying. Most
*        non-Frame Mappings, on the other hand, are immutable and so when
*        they are simplified it is certain that they weill remain in a
*        simple state.

*
*     This attribute is provided as an aid to debugging, and to avoid

*  Applicability:

*        When applied to a compound Mapping (CmpMap), only the Report

*     FrameSet
*        When applied to any FrameSet, the formatting capabilities of
*        the base and current Frames will be used (as above) to
*        individually format the input and output coordinates, as
*        appropriate. The Report attribute of a FrameSet is not itself
*        affected by selecting a new base or current Frame, but the

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping initialiser.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided for use by class implementations to initialise
*     a new Mapping object. It allocates memory (if necessary) to accommodate
*     the Mapping plus any additional data associated with the derived class.
*     It then initialises a Mapping structure at the start of this memory. If
*     the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a virtual
*     function table for a Mapping at the start of the memory passed via the
*     "vtab" parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory in which the Mapping is to be initialised.
*        This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the Mapping data
*        (sizeof(Mapping)) plus any data used by the derived class. If a value
*        of NULL is given, this function will allocate the memory itself using
*        the "size" parameter to determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the Mapping (plus derived class data).
*        This will be used to allocate memory if a value of NULL is given for
*        the "mem" parameter. This value is also stored in the Mapping
*        structure, so a valid value must be supplied even if not required for
*        allocating memory.
*     init
*        A logical flag indicating if the Mapping's virtual function table is
*        to be initialised. If this value is non-zero, the virtual function
*        table will be initialised by this function.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be associated
*        with the new Mapping.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which contains
*        the name of the class to which the new object belongs (it is this
*        pointer value that will subsequently be returned by the astGetClass
*        method).
*     nin
*        The number of coordinate values per input point.
*     nout
*        The number of coordinate vales per output point.
*     tran_forward
*        A non-zero value indicates that the Mapping will be able to
*        transform coordinates in the forward direction. A zero value
*        indicates that it will not.
*     tran_inverse
*        A non-zero value indicates that the Mapping will be able to
*        transform coordinates in the inverse direction. A zero value
*        indicates that it will not.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Mapping.

*  Notes:
*     -  The Mappings produced by this function implement all the basic methods
*     defined by the Mapping class. However, their astTransform method does not
*     actually perform any coordinate transformation (although it performs all
*     necessary argument validation and creates an output PointSet if
*     necessary, leaving its coordinate values undefined).
*     -  This means that Mappings produced by this function are of limited use
*     on their own, but may easily be extended by a derived class simply by
*     over-riding the astTransform method to add the necessary coordinate
*     arithmetic.
*     -  A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked with the
*     global error status set, or if it should fail for any reason.

*  Name:
*     astLoadMapping

*  Purpose:
*     Load a Mapping.

*  Type:
*     Protected function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "mapping.h"
*     AstMapping *astLoadMapping( void *mem, size_t size,
*                                 AstMappingVtab *vtab, const char *name,
*                                 AstChannel *channel )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping loader.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided to load a new Mapping using data read
*     from a Channel. It first loads the data used by the parent class
*     (which allocates memory if necessary) and then initialises a
*     Mapping structure in this memory, using data read from the input
*     Channel.
*
*     If the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a
*     virtual function table for a Mapping at the start of the memory
*     passed via the "vtab" parameter.


*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory into which the Mapping is to be
*        loaded.  This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the
*        Mapping data (sizeof(Mapping)) plus any data used by derived
*        classes. If a value of NULL is given, this function will
*        allocate the memory itself using the "size" parameter to
*        determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the Mapping (plus derived class
*        data).  This will be used to allocate memory if a value of
*        NULL is given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also
*        stored in the Mapping structure, so a valid value must be
*        supplied even if not required for allocating memory.
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "size" value is ignored
*        and sizeof(AstMapping) is used instead.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be
*        associated with the new Mapping. If this is NULL, a pointer
*        to the (static) virtual function table for the Mapping class
*        is used instead.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which
*        contains the name of the class to which the new object
*        belongs (it is this pointer value that will subsequently be
*        returned by the astGetClass method).
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "name" value is ignored
*        and a pointer to the string "Mapping" is used instead.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Mapping.

*  Notes:
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Description:
c     This function returns pointers to two Mappings which, when applied
f     This routine returns pointers to two Mappings which, when applied
*     either in series or parallel, are equivalent to the supplied Mapping.
*
*     Since the Frame class inherits from the Mapping class, Frames can

c     series

c        Address of a location to receive a value indicating if the
c        component Mappings are applied in series or parallel. A non-zero
c        value means that the supplied Mapping is equivalent to applying map1
c        followed by map2 in series. A zero value means that the supplied
c        Mapping is equivalent to applying map1 to the lower numbered axes
c        and map2 to the higher numbered axes, in parallel.
f        Indicates if the
f        component Mappings are applied in series or parallel. A .TRUE.
f        value means that the supplied Mapping is equivalent to applying MAP1
f        followed by MAP2 in series. A zero value means that the supplied
f        Mapping is equivalent to applying MAP1 to the lower numbered axes
f        and MAP2 to the higher numbered axes, in parallel.
c     invert1
f     INVERT1 = INTEGER (Returned)

f     INVERT2 = INTEGER (Returned)
c        The value of the Invert attribute to be used with map2.
f        The value of the Invert attribute to be used with MAP2.

*  Applicability:
*     CmpMap
c        If the supplied Mapping is a CmpMap, then map1 and map2 will be

*        the Invert attribute of either of the component Mappings using
*        the returned pointers will have no effect on the supplied CmpMap.
*        This is because the CmpMap remembers and uses the original settings
*        of the Invert attributes (that is, the values of the Invert
*        attributes when the CmpMap was first created). These are the
c        Invert values which are returned in invert1 and invert2.

f        Invert values which are returned in INVERT1 and INVERT2.
*     Mapping
c        For any class of Mapping other than a CmpMap, map1 will be
c        returned holding a clone of the supplied Mapping pointer, and map2
c        will be returned holding a NULL pointer. Invert1 will be returned
c        holding the current value of the Invert attribute for the supplied
c        Mapping, and invert2 will be returned holding zero.
f        For any class of Mapping other than a CmpMap, MAP1 will be
f        returned holding a clone of the supplied Mapping pointer, and MAP2
f        will be returned holding AST__NULL. INVERT1 will be returned
f        holding the current value of the Invert attribute for the supplied
f        Mapping, and INVERT2 will be returned holding zero.
*     CmpFrame

*     Frame
c        For any class of Frame other than a CmpFrame, map1 will be

f        returned holding a clone of the supplied Frame pointer, and MAP2
f        will be returned holding AST__NULL.

*  Notes:
*     - The returned Invert values should be used in preference to the
*     current values of the Invert attribute in map1 and map2. This is
*     because the attributes may have changed value since the Mappings
*     were combined.
*     - Any changes made to the component Mappings using the returned
*     pointers will be reflected in the supplied Mapping.

c     taken by a nominated output coordinate within that

f     The routine works on one dimension at a time. When supplied with

*
*        Note that it is permissible for the upper bound to be less
*        than the corresponding lower bound, as the values will simply
*        be swapped before use.
c     forward
f     FORWARD = LOGICAL (Given)
c        If this value is non-zero, then the Mapping's forward
c        transformation will be used to transform the input
c        box. Otherwise, its inverse transformation will be used.
f        If this value is .TRUE., then the Mapping's forward

f        of the Mapping's input coordinates.)
c     coord_out
f     COORD_OUT = INTEGER (Given)
*        The index of the output coordinate for which the lower and

c     lbnd_out
f     LBND_OUT = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
c        Pointer to a double in which to return the lowest value taken
c        by the nominated output coordinate within the specified

c     xl
f     XL( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
c        An optional pointer to an array of double, with one element
c        for each Mapping input coordinate. If given, this array will
c        be filled with the coordinates of an input point (although

c        coordinate attains the lower bound value returned in

c
c        If these coordinates are not required, a NULL pointer may be
c        supplied.
f        An array with one element for each Mapping input
f        coordinate. This will return the coordinates of an input
f        point (although not necessarily a unique one) for which the
f        nominated output coordinate attains the lower bound value
f        returned in LBND_OUT.
c     xu
f     XU( * ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
c        An optional pointer to an array of double, with one element
c        for each Mapping input coordinate. If given, this array will
c        be filled with the coordinates of an input point (although
c        not necessarily a unique one) for which the nominated output
c        coordinate attains the upper bound value returned in

c
c        If these coordinates are not required, a NULL pointer may be
c        supplied.
f        An array with one element for each Mapping input
f        coordinate. This will return the coordinates of an input

f        nominated output coordinate attains the upper bound value
f        returned in UBND_OUT.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - Any input points which are transformed by the Mapping to give
*     output coordinates containing the value AST__BAD are regarded as
*     invalid and are ignored. They will make no contribution to
*     determining the output bounds, even although the nominated
*     output coordinate might still have a valid value at such points.
c     - An error will occur if the required output bounds cannot be
c     found. Typically, this might happen if all the input points
c     which the function considers turn out to be invalid (see
c     above). The number of points considered before generating such
c     an error is quite large, so this is unlikely to occur by
c     accident unless valid points are restricted to a very small

*        Mapping which are fed by the picked inputs. A value of one is
*        used to refer to the first Mapping output. The supplied array should
*        have a length at least equal to the number of outputs in the

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the astMapSplit method available via the
*     public interface to the Mapping class and uses 1-based axis indices.
*     The protected interface method is provided by the astMapSplit function
*     and uses zero-based axis indices. Also, an ID value is returned for
*     "map" rather than a pointer.
