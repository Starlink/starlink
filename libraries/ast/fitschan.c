*  Name:
*     FitsChan

*  Purpose:
*     I/O Channel using FITS header cards to represent Objects.

*  Constructor Function:
c     astFitsChan
f     AST_FITSCHAN

*  Description:
*     A FitsChan is a specialised form of Channel which supports I/O
*     operations involving the use of FITS (Flexible Image Transport
*     System) header cards. Writing an Object to a FitsChan (using
c     astWrite) will, if the Object is suitable, generate a
f     AST_WRITE) will, if the Object is suitable, generate a
*     description of that Object composed of FITS header cards, and
*     reading from a FitsChan will create a new Object from its FITS
*     header card description.
*
*     While a FitsChan is active, it represents a buffer which may
*     contain zero or more 80-character "header cards" conforming to
*     FITS conventions. Any sequence of FITS-conforming header cards
*     may be stored, apart from the "END" card whose existence is
*     merely implied.  The cards may be accessed in any order by using
*     the FitsChan's integer Card attribute, which identifies a "current"
*     card, to which subsequent operations apply. Searches
c     based on keyword may be performed (using astFindFits), new
c     cards may be inserted (astPutFits, astPutCards, astSetFits<X>) and
c     existing ones may be deleted (astDelFits), extracted (astGetFits<X>),
c     or changed (astSetFits<X>).
f     based on keyword may be performed (using AST_FINDFITS), new
f     cards may be inserted (AST_PUTFITS, AST_PUTCARDS, AST_SETFITS<X>) and
f     existing ones may be deleted (AST_DELFITS), extracted
f     (AST_GETFITS<X>) or changed (AST_SETFITS<X>).
*
*     When you create a FitsChan, you have the option of specifying
*     "source" and "sink" functions which connect it to external data
*     stores by reading and writing FITS header cards. If you provide
*     a source function, it is used to fill the FitsChan with header cards
*     when it is accessed for the first time. If you do not provide a
*     source function, the FitsChan remains empty until you explicitly enter
c     data into it (e.g. using astPutFits, astPutCards, astWrite
f     data into it (e.g. using AST_PUTFITS, AST_PUTCARDS, AST_WRITE
*     or by using the SourceFile attribute to specifying a text file from
*     which headers should be read). When the FitsChan is deleted, any
*     remaining header cards in the FitsChan can be saved in either of
*     two ways: 1) by specifying a value for the SinkFile attribute (the
*     name of a text file to which header cards should be written), or 2)
*     by providing a sink function (used to to deliver header cards to an
*     external data store). If you do not provide a sink function or a
*     value for SinkFile, any header cards remaining when the FitsChan
*     is deleted will be lost, so you should arrange to extract them
*     first if necessary
c     (e.g. using astFindFits or astRead).
f     (e.g. using AST_FINDFITS or AST_READ).
*
*     Coordinate system information may be described using FITS header
*     cards using several different conventions, termed
*     "encodings". When an AST Object is written to (or read from) a
*     FitsChan, the value of the FitsChan's Encoding attribute
*     determines how the Object is converted to (or from) a
*     description involving FITS header cards. In general, different
*     encodings will result in different sets of header cards to
*     describe the same Object. Examples of encodings include the DSS
*     encoding (based on conventions used by the STScI Digitised Sky
*     Survey data), the FITS-WCS encoding (based on a proposed FITS
*     standard) and the NATIVE encoding (a near loss-less way of
*     storing AST Objects in FITS headers).
*
*     The available encodings differ in the range of Objects they can
*     represent, in the number of Object descriptions that can coexist
*     in the same FitsChan, and in their accessibility to other
*     (external) astronomy applications (see the Encoding attribute
*     for details). Encodings are not necessarily mutually exclusive
*     and it may sometimes be possible to describe the same Object in
*     several ways within a particular set of FITS header cards by
*     using several different encodings.
*
c     The detailed behaviour of astRead and astWrite, when used with
f     The detailed behaviour of AST_READ and AST_WRITE, when used with
*     a FitsChan, depends on the encoding in use. In general, however,
c     all successful use of astRead is destructive, so that FITS header cards
f     all successful use of AST_READ is destructive, so that FITS header cards
*     are consumed in the process of reading an Object, and are
*     removed from the FitsChan (this deletion can be prevented for
*     specific cards by calling the
c     astRetainFits function).
f     AST_RETAINFITS routine).
*     An unsuccessful call of
c     astRead
f     AST_READ
*     (for instance, caused by the FitsChan not containing the necessary
*     FITS headers cards needed to create an Object) results in the
*     contents of the FitsChan being left unchanged.
*
*     If the encoding in use allows only a single Object description
*     to be stored in a FitsChan (e.g. the DSS, FITS-WCS and FITS-IRAF
c     encodings), then write operations using astWrite will
f     encodings), then write operations using AST_WRITE will
*     over-write any existing Object description using that
*     encoding. Otherwise (e.g. the NATIVE encoding), multiple Object
*     descriptions are written sequentially and may later be read
*     back in the same sequence.

*     The FitsChan class inherits from the Channel class.

*  History:
*     11-DEC-1996 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     20-MAR-1997 (DSB):
*        Made keyword setting and getting functions protected instead of
*        public. Renamed public methods. Added Ncard attribute.
*     20-MAY-1997 (RFWS):
*        Tidied public prologues.
*     30-JUN-1997 (DSB):
*        Added support for reading post-2000 DATE-OBS strings. Reading DSS
*        or FITS-WCS objects now returns NULL unless the FitsChan is
*        positioned at the start-of-file prior to the read. Bug fixed
*        which caused Ncard to be returned too large by one. Removed
*        dependancy on hard-wired header and footer text in Native
*        FitsChans.
*     18-AUG-1997 (DSB):
*        Bug fixed in WcsNative which caused incorrect CRVAL values
*        to be used if the axes needed permuting. Values assigned to the
*        Projection attribute fo the SkyFrames created by astRead.
*     2-SEP-1997 (DSB):
*        Added the IRAF convention that EPOCH=0.0 really means EPOCH=1950.0
*        (the EPOCH keyword is deprecated in the new FITS-WCS conventions
*        and is taken always as a Besselian epoch).
*     19-SEP-1997 (DSB):
*        Corrected interpretation of the FITS CD matrix.
*     25-SEP-1997 (DSB):
*        o  Fix bug in LinearMap which caused it always to detect a linear
*        mapping. For instance, this allowed DssMaps to be erroneously
*        written out using FITS-WCS encoding with a CAR projection.
*        o  Assign a full textual description to SkyFrame's Projection
*        attribute instead of a 3 letter acronym.
*        o  If DATE-OBS >= 1999.0 then DATE-OBS is now written in new
*        Y2000 format. For DATE-OBS < 1999.0, the old format is written.
*        o  Add new attribute CDMatrix to determine whether PC or CD
*        matrices should be used when writing objects using FITS-WCS
*        encoding.
*        o  Modified the way floating point values are formatted to omit
*        unnecessary leading zeros from the exponent (i.e. E-5 instead of
*        E-05).
*        o  New-line characters at the end of supplied header cards are now
*        ignored.
*        o  Cater for EQUINOX specified as a string prefixed by B or J
*        rather than as a floating point value (some HST data does this).
*        o  Corrected SetValue so that it always inserts comment cards
*        rather than over-write existing comment cards. Previously,
*        writing a FrameSet to a DSS encoded FitsChan resulted in all
*        comments cards being stripped except for the last one.
*        o  Reading a FrameSet from a DSS-encoded FrameSet now only
*        removes the keywords actually required to construct the FrameSet.
*        Previously, all keywords were removed.
*        o  The EPOCH and EQUINOX keywords created when a FrameSet is
*        written to a DSS-encoded FitsChan are now determined from the
*        epoch and equinox of the current Frame, instead of from a copy
*        of the original FitsChan stored within the DssMap.
*        o  The Encoding and CDMatrix attributes, and keyword types are
*        now stored as strings externally instead of integers.
*     11-NOV-1997 (DSB):
*        o  Assume default of j2000 for DSS EQUINOX value.
*        o  Check for null object pointers in the interfaces for
*        virtual functions which execute even if an error has previously
*        occurred. Otherwise, a segmentation violation can occur when
*        trying to find the member function pointer.
*        o  Trailing spaces ignored in Encoding attribute.
*        o  Bugs fixed in FindWcs and SetValue which resulted in WCS cards
*        being written at the wrong place if the supplied FitsChan does not
*        contain any WCS keywords.
*        o  Default for CDMatrix (if no axis rotation keywords can be found)
*        changed to 2 (i.e. use "CDi_j" form keywords).
*        o  Write now leaves the current card unchanged if nothing is
*        written to the FitsChan.
*     17-NOV-1997 (RFWS):
*        Disabled use of CDmatrix. Fixed initialisation problems in
*        astLoadFitsChan.
*     24-NOV-1997 (DSB):
*        Replace references to error code AST__OPT with AST__RDERR.
*     28-NOV-1997 (DSB):
*        o  Function WcsValues modified to prevent it from changing the
*        current card. Previously, this could cause new cards to be
*        written to the wrong place in a FITS-WCS encoded FitsChan.
*        o  Description of argument "value" corrected in prologue of
*        function SetFits.
*        o  Argument "lastkey" removed from function SetValue since it
*        was never used (it was a relic from a previous method of
*        determining where to store new cards). Corresponding changes
*        have been made to all the functions which create "lastkey" values
*        or pass them on to SetValue (i.e DescWcs, WcsPrimary, WcsSecondary,
*        WriteWcs and WriteDss).
*     10-DEC-1997 (DSB):
*        Bug fixed which caused the initial character designating the system
*        within CTYPE value (eg E in ELON, G in GLON, etc) to be omitted.
*     1-JUN-1998 (DSB):
*        CDELT values of zero are now replaced by a small non-zero value
*        when creating the "pixel-to-relative physical" transformation
*        matrix. Previously, zero CDELT values could cause the matrix to
*        be non-invertable.
*     4-SEP-1998 (DSB):
*        - Indicate that SphMaps created by this class when using FITS-WCS
*        encoding all operate on the unit sphere. This aids simplification.
*        - Fix a bug in StoreFits which caused CD matrices to be indexed
*        incorrectly (sometimes causing floating exceptions) if they do not
*        describe a celestial longitude/latitude system.
*        - Changed astFindFits to ignore trailing spaces in the keyword
*        template.
*        - astSplit changed so that an error is not reported if a textual
*        keyword value ends before column 20.
*     7-OCT-1998 (DSB):
*        - Corrected test for linearity in LinearMap to include a factor
*        of the test vector length. Also LinearMap now uses a simplified
*        Mapping.
*     5-NOV-1998 (DSB):
*        Added FITS-IRAF encoding.
*     9-NOV-1998 (DSB):
*        - Corrected values of macros DSS_ENCODING and MAX_ENCODING.
*        - Corrected erroneous success indication in IrafStore.
*        - Included checks for bad values in function LinearMap.
*     17-NOV-1998 (DSB):
*        The Domain name GRID is now given to the Base Frame in any FrameSets
*        created by astRead when using FitsChans with DSS, FITS-WCS or
*        FITS-IRAF encodings.
*     18-DEC-1998 (DSB):
*        Check for "D" exponents in floating point keyword strings.
*     12-FEB-1998 (DSB):
*        Modified EncodeFloat to avoid exceeding the 20 character FITS
*        limit wherever possible if FitsDigits is positive.
*     10-MAY-1998 (DSB):
*        Bug fixed in astSplit which caused comments associated with string
*        keywords to be lost when storing the card in a FitsChan.
*     15-JUN-1999 (DSB):
*        Report an error if an unrecognised projection name is supplied.
*     9-DEC-1999 (DSB):
*        - Fixed bug in WcsNatPole which could result in longitude values
*        being out by 180 degrees for cylindrical projections such as CAR.
*        - Only report an "unrecognised projection" error for CTYPE values
*        which look like celestial longitude or latitude axes (i.e. if the
*        first 4 characters are "RA--", "DEC-", "xLON" or "xLAT", and the
*        fifth character is "-").
*        - Added function SpecTrans to translated keywords related to the
*        IRAF ZPX projection into keyword for the standard ZPN projection.
*        - Add ICRS as a valid value for the RADECSYS keyword. Since the
*        SkyFrame class does not yet support ICRS, an FK5 SkyFrame is
*        created if RADECSYS=ICRS.
*     16-DEC-1999 (DSB):
*        - Modified SpecTrans so that all keywords used to created a
*        standard WCS representation from a non-standard one are consumed
*        by the astRead operation.
*        - Changed the text of ASTWARN cards added to the FitsChan if an
*        IRAF ZPX projection is found to require unsupported corrections.
*        - Simplified the documentation describing the handling of the IRAF
*        ZPX projection.
*        - Fixed code which assumed that the 10 FITS-WCS projection
*        parameters were PROJP1 -> PROJP10. In fact they are PROJP0 -
*        PROJP9. This could cause projection parameter values to be
*        incorrectly numbered when they are written out upon deletion of
*        the FitsChan.
*     1-FEB-2000 (DSB):
*        Check that FITS_IRAF encoding is not being used before using a
*        PC matrix when reading WCS information from a header. This is
*        important if the header contains both PC and CD matrices.
*     8-FEB-2000 (DSB):
*        - Header cards are now only consumed by an astRead operation if the
*        operation succeeds (i.e. returns a non-null Object).
*        - The original FITS-WCS encoding has been renamed as FITS-PC (to
*        indicate the use of a PCiiijjj matrix), and a new FITS-WCS
*        encoding has been added.
*        - The disabled CDMatrix attribute has been removed.
*        - Bug in LinearMap corrected which prevented genuinely linear
*        Mappings from being judged to be linear. This bug was previously
*        fudged (so it now appears) by the introduction of the test vector
*        length factor (see History entry for 7-OCT-1998). This test
*        vector length scale factor has consequently now been removed.
*        - Added FITS-AIPS encoding.
*        - The critical keywords used to select default encoding have been
*        changed.
*        - Support for common flavours of IRAF TNX projections added.
*        - The algorithm used to find a WcsMap in the supplied FrameSet
*        has been improved so that compound Mappings which contain complex
*        mixtures of parallel and serial Mappings can be translated into
*        FITS-WCS encoding.
*        - Trailing white space in string keyword values is now retained
*        when using foreign encodings to enable correct concatenation where
*        a string has been split over several keywords. E.g. if 2 string
*        keywords contain a list of formatted numerical values (e.g. IRAF
*        WAT... keywords), and the 1st one ends "0.123 " and the next one
*        begins "1234.5 ", the trailing space at the end of the first keyword
*        is needed to prevent the two numbers being merged into "0.1231234.5".
*        Trailing spaces in native encodings is still protected by enclosing
*        the whole string in double quotes.
*        - The Channel methods WriteString and GetNextData can now save
*        and restore strings of arbitary length. This is done by storing
*        as much of the string as possible in the usual way, and then
*        storing any remaining characters in subsequent CONTINUE cards,
*        using the FITSIO conventions. This storage and retrieval of long
*        strings is only available for native encodings.
*     19-MAY-2000 (DSB):
*        Added attribute Warnings. Lowered DSS in the priority list
*        of encodings implemented by GetEncoding.
*     6-OCT-2000 (DSB):
*        Increased size of buffers used to store CTYPE values to take
*        account of the possiblity of lots of trailing spaces.
*     5-DEC-2000 (DSB):
*        Add support for the WCSNAME FITS keyword.
*     12-DEC-2000 (DSB):
*        Add a title to each physical, non-celestial coord Frame based on
*        its Domain name (if any).
*     3-APR-2001 (DSB):
*        -  Use an "unknown" celestial coordinate system, instead of a
*        Cartesian coordinate system, if the CTYPE keywords specify an
*        unknown celestial coordinate system.
*        -  Do not report an error if there are no CTYPE keywords in the
*        header (assume a unit mapping, like in La Palma FITS files).
*        -  Add a NoCTYPE warning condition.
*        -  Added AllWarnings attribute.
*        -  Ensure multiple copies of identical warnings are not produced.
*        -  Use the Object Ident attribute to store the identifier letter
*        associated with each Frame read from a secondary axis description,
*        so that they can be given the same letter when they are written
*        out to a new FITS file.
*     10-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        - Corrected function value returned by SkySys to be 1 unless an
*        error occurs. This error resulted in CAR headers being produced
*        by astWrite with CRVAL and CD values till in radians rather than
*        degrees.
*        - Introduced SplitMap2 in order to guard against producing
*        celestial FITS headers for a Mapping which includes more than
*        one WcsMap.
*     13-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        - Modified FixNew so that it retains the current card index if possible.
*        This fixed a bug which could cause headers written out using Native
*        encodings to be non-contiguous.
*        - Corrected ComBlock to correctly remove AST comment blocks in
*        native encoded fitschans.
*     14-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        - Modified FixUsed so that it it does not set the current card
*        back to the start of file if the last card in the FitsChan is
*        deleted.
*     16-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        Modified WcsNative to limit reference point latitude to range
*        +/-90 degs (previously values outside this range were wrapped
*        round onto the opposite meridian). Also added new warning
*        condition "badlat".
*     23-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        - Re-write LinearMap to use a least squares fit.
*        - Check that CDj_i is not AST__BAD within WcsWithWcs when
*        forming the increments along each physical axis.
*     28-SEP-2001 (DSB):
*        GoodWarns changed so that no error is reported if a blank list
*        of conditions is supplied.
*     12-OCT-2001 (DSB):
*        - Added DefB1950 attribute.
*        - Corrected equations which calculate CROTA when writing
*        FITS-AIPS encodings.
*        - Corrected equations which turn a CROTA value into a CD matrix.
*     29-NOV-2001 (DSB):
*        Corrected use of "_" and "-" characters when referring to FK4-NO-E
*        system in function SkySys.
*     20-FEB-2002 (DSB)
*        Added CarLin attribute.
*     8-MAY-2002 (DSB):
*        Correct DSSToStore to ignore trailing blanks in the PLTDECSN
*        keyword value.
*     9-MAY-2002 (DSB):
*        Correct GetCard to avoid infinite loop if the current card has
*        been marked as deleted.
*     25-SEP-2002 (DSB):
*        AIPSFromStore: use larger of coscro and sincro when determining
*        CDELT values. Previously a non-zero coscro was always used, even
*        if it was a s small as 1.0E-17.
*     3-OCT-2002 (DSB):
*        - SkySys: Corrected calculation of longitude axis index for unknown
*        celestial systems.
*        - SpecTrans: Corrected check for latcor terms for ZPX projections.
*        - WcsFrame: Only store an explicit equinox value in a skyframe if
*        it needs one (i.e. if the system is ecliptic or equatorial).
*        - WcsWithWcs: For Zenithal projections, always use the default
*        LONPOLE value, and absorb any excess rotation caused by this
*        into the CD matrix.
*        - WcsWithWcs: Improve the check that the native->celestial mapping
*        is a pure rotation, allowing for rotations which change the
*        handed-ness of the system (if possible).
*        - WcsWithWcs: Avoid using LONPOLE keywords when creating headers
*        for a zenithal projection. Instead, add the corresponding rotation
*        into the CD matrix.
*     22-OCT-2002 (DSB):
*        - Retain leading and trailing white space within COMMENT cards.
*        - Only use CTYPE comments as axis labels if all non-celestial
*          axes have a unique non-blank comment (otherwise use CTYPE
*          values as labels).
*        - Updated to use latest FITS-WCS projections. This means that the
*          "TAN with projection terms" is no longer a standard FITS
*          projection. It is now represented using the AST-specific TPN
*          projection (until such time as FITS-WCS paper IV is finished).
*        - Remove trailing "Z" from DATE-OBS values created by astWrite.
*     14-NOV-2002 (DSB):
*        - WcsWithWcs: Corrected to ignore longitude axis returned by
*        astPrimaryFrame since it does not take into account any axis
*        permutation.
*     26-NOV-2002 (DSB):
*        - SpecTrans: Corrected no. of characters copied from CTYPE to PRJ,
*        (from 5 to 4), and terminate PRJ correctly.
*     8-JAN-2003 (DSB):
*        Changed private InitVtab method to protected astInitFitsChanVtab
*        method.
*     22-JAN-2003 (DSB):
*        Restructured the functions used for reading FITS_WCS headers to
*        make the distinction between the generic parts (pixel->intermediate
*        world coordinates) and the specialised parts (e.g. celestial,
*        spectral, etc) clearer.
*     31-JAN-2003 (DSB)
*        - Added Clean attribute.
*        - Corrected initialisation and defaulting of CarLin and DefB1950
*        attributes.
*        - Extensive changes to allow foreign encodings to be produced in
*        cases where the Base Frame has fewer axes than the Current Frame.
*     12-FEB-2003 (DSB)
*        - Modified SetFits so that the existing card comment is retained
*        if the new data value equals the existing data value.
*     30-APR-2003 (DSB):
*        - Revert to standard "TAN" code for distorted tan projections,
*        rather than using the "TPN" code. Also recognise QVi_m (produced
*        by AUTOASTROM) as an alternative to PVi_m when reading distorted
*        TAN headers.
*     22-MAY-2003 (DSB):
*        Modified GetEncoding so that the presence of RADECSYS and/or
*        PROJPm is only considered significant if the modern equivalent
*        keyword (REDESYS or PVi_m) is *NOT* present.
*     2-JUN-2003 (DSB):
*        - Added support for PCi_j kewwords within FITS-WCS encoding
*        - Added CDMatrix attribute
*        - Changed internal FitsStore usage to use PC/CDELT instead of CD
*        (as preparation for FITS-WCS paper IV).
*        - Added warning "BadMat".
*     11-JUN-2003 (DSB):
*        - Modified WcsNative to use the new SphMap PolarLong attribute
*        in order to ensure correct propagation of the longitude CRVAL
*        value in cases where the fiducial point is coincident with a pole.
*        - Use PVi_3 and PVi_4 for longitude axis "i" (if present) in
*        preference to LONPOLE and LATPOLE when reading a FITS-WCS header.
*        Note, these projection values are never written out (LONPOLE and
*        LATPOLE are written instead).
*        - Associate "RADESYS=ICRS" with SkyFrame( "System=ICRS" ), rather
*        than SkyFrame( "System=FK5" ).
*        - If DefB1950 is zero, use ICRS instead of FK5 as the default RADESYS
*        if no EQUINOX is present.
*     1-SEP-2003 (DSB):
*        - Modify Dump so that it dumps all cards including those flagged as
*        having been read.
*        - Added "reset" parameter to FixUsed.
*        - WcsMapFrm: store an Ident of ' ' for the primary coordinate
*        description (previously Ident was left unset)
*        - Default value for DefB1950 attribute now depends on the value
*        of the Encoding attribute.
*     15-SEP-2003 (DSB):
*        - Added Warnings "BadVal", "Distortion".
*        - Ignore FITS-WCS paper IV CTYPE distortion codes (except for
*          "-SIP" which is interpreted correctly on reading).
*     22-OCT-2003 (DSB):
*        - GetEncoding: If the header contains CDi_j but does not contain
*        any of the old IRAF keywords (RADECSYS, etc) then assume FITS-WCS
*        encoding. This allows a FITS-WCS header to have both CDi_j *and*
*        CROTA keywords.
*     5-JAN-2004 (DSB):
*        - SpecTrans: Use 1.0 (instead of the CDELT value) as the
*        diagonal PCi_j term for non-celestial axes with associated CROTA
*        values.
*     12-JAN-2004 (DSB):
*        - CelestialAxes: Initialise "tmap1" pointer to NULL in case of error
*        (avoids a segvio happening in the case of an error).
*        - AddVersion: Do not attempt to add a Frame into the FITS header
*        if the mapping from grid to frame is not invertable.
*        - WorldAxes: Initialise the returned "perm" values to safe values,
*        and return these values if no basis vectors cen be created.
*     19-JAN-2004 (DSB):
*        - When reading a FITS-WCS header, allow all keywords to be defaulted
*        as decribed in paper I.
*     27-JAN-2004 (DSB):
*        - Modify FitLine to use correlation between actual and estimated
*        axis value as the test for linearity.
*        - Modify RoundFString to avoid writing beyond the end of the
*        supplied buffer if the supplied string contains a long list of 9's.
*     11-MAR-2004 (DSB):
*        - Modified SpecTrans to check all axis descriptions for keywords
*        to be translated.
*     19-MAR-2004 (DSB):
*        - Added astPutCards to support new fits_hdr2str function in
*        CFITSIO.
*     25-MAR-2004 (DSB):
*        - Corrected bug in astSplit which causes legal cards to be
*        rejected because characters beyond the 80 char limit are being
*        considered significant.
*        - Corrected bug in SpecTrans which caused QV keywords to be
*        ignored.
*     15-APR-2004 (DSB):
*        - SpecTrans modified to include translation of old "-WAV", "-FRQ"
*        and "-VEL" spectral algorithm codes to modern "-X2P" form.
*        - WcsFromStore modified to supress creation of WCSAXES keywords
*        for un-used axis versions.
*        - IsMapLinear modified to improve fit by doing a second least
*        squares fit to the residualleft by the first least squares fit.
*     16-APR-2004 (DSB):
*        - NonLinSpecWcs: Issue a warning if an illegal non-linear
*        spectral code is encountered.
*        - Add a BadCTYPE warning condition.
*        - Corrected default value for Clean so that it is zero (as
*        documented).
*     21-APR-2004 (DSB):
*        - FindWcs: Corrected to use correct OBSGEO template. This bug
*        caused OBSGEO keywords to be misplaced in written headers.
*     23-APR-2004 (DSB):
*        - SplitMap: Modified so that a Mapping which has celestial axes
*        with constant values (such as produced by a PermMap) are treated
*        as a valid sky coordinate Mapping.
*        - AddFrame modified so that WCS Frames with a different number
*        of axes ot the pixel Frame can be added into the FrameSet.
*        - IRAFFromStore and AIPSFromStore modified so that they do not
*        create any output keywords if the number of WCS axes is different
*        to the number of pixel axes.
*        - Handling of OBSGEO-X/Y/Z corrected again.
*        - WCSFromStore modified to avouid writing partial axis descriptions.
*     26-APR-2004 (DSB):
*        - Corrected text of output SPECSYS keyword values.
*     17-MAY-2004 (DSB):
*        - Added IWC attribute.
*     15-JUN-2004 (DSB):
*        - Ensure out-of-bounds longitude CRPIX values for CAR
*        projections are wrapped back into bounds.
*     21-JUN-2004 (DSB):
*        - Ensure primary MJD-OBS value is used when reading foreign FITS
*        headers.
*     7-JUL-2004 (DSB):
*        - Issue errors if an un-invertable PC/CD matrix is supplied in a
*        FITS-WCS Header.
*     11-JUL-2004 (DSB):
*        - Re-factor code for checking spectral axis CTYPE values into
*        new function IsSpectral.
*        - Modify AIPSFromSTore to create spectral axis keywords if
*        possible.
*        - Modify SpecTrans to recognize AIPS spectral axis keywords, and
*        to convert "HZ" to "Hz".
*        - Added FITS-AIPS++ encoding.
*     12-AUG-2004 (DSB):
*        - Convert GLS projection codes to equivalent SFL in SpecTrans.
*        - Added FITS-CLASS encoding.
*     16-AUG-2004 (DSB):
*        - Removed support for paper III keyword VSOURCE, and added
*        support for SSYSSRC keyword.
*        - Added initial support for CLASS encoding.
*        - In FitOK: Changed tolerance for detecting constant values
*        from 1.0E-10 to 1.0E-8.
*     17-AUG-2004 (DSB):
*        Correct GetFiducialNSC so that the stored values for longitude
*        parameters 1 and 2 are ignored unless the value of parameter 0 is
*        not zero.
*     19-AUG-2004 (DSB):
*        Modify SpecTrans to ignore any CDELT values if the header
*        includes some CDi_j values.
*     26-AUG-2004 (DSB):
*        Modify astSplit_ to allow floating point keyword values which
*        include an exponent to be specified with no decimal point
*        (e.g. "2E-4").
*     27-AUG-2004 (DSB):
*        Completed initial attempt at a FITS-CLASS encoding.
*     9-SEP-2004 (DSB):
*        Fixed usage of uninitialised values within ReadCrval.
*     13-SEP-2004 (DSB):
*        Check the "text" pointer can be used safely before using it in
*        DSSToStore.
*     27-SEP-2004 (DSB):
*        In SpecTrans, before creating new PCi_j values,  check that no
*        PCi_j values have been created via an earlier translation.
*     28-SEP-2004 (DSB):
*        In AIPSPPFromStore only get projection parameters values if there
*        are some celestialaxes. Also allow CROTA to describe rotation of
*        non-celestial axes (same for AIPSFromSTore).
*     4-OCT-2004 (DSB):
*        Correct rounding of CRPIX in AddVersion to avoid integer overflow.
*     11-NOV-2004 (DSB):
*        - WcsFcRead: Avoid issuing warnings about bad keywords which
*        have already been translated into equivalent good forms.
*        - SpecTrans: If both PROJP and PV keywords are present, use PV
*        in favour of PROJP only if the PV values look correct.
*     17-NOV-2004 (DSB):
*        - Make astSetFits<X> public.
*     16-MAR-2005 (DSB):
*        - Primary OBSGEO-X/Y/Z, MJD-AVG and MJDOBS keywords are associated
*        with all axis descriptions and should not have a trailing single
*        character indicating an alternate axis set.
*     9-AUG-2005 (DSB):
*        In WcsMapFrm, check reffrm is used before annulling it.
*     8-SEP-2005 (DSB):
*        - Change "if( a < b < c )" constructs to "if( a < b && b < c )"
*        - DSBSetup: correct test on FrameSet pointer state
*        - Ensure CLASS keywords written to a FitsChan do not come before
*        the final fixed position keyword.
*     9-SEP-2005 (DSB):
*        - Added "AZ--" and "EL--" as allowed axis types in FITS-WCS
*        ctype values.
*     12-SEP-2005 (DSB):
*        - Cast difference between two pointers to (int)
*        - CLASSFromStore:Check source velocity is defined before
*          storing it in the output header.
*     13-SEP-2005 (DSB):
*        - Corrected B1940 to B1950 in AddEncodingFrame. This bug
*        prevented some FrameSets being written out using FITS-CLASS.
*        - Rationalise the use of the "mapping" pointer in AddVersion.
*        - WcsCelestial: Modified so that the FITS reference point is
*        stored as the SkyFrame SkyRef attribute value.
*     7-OCT-2005 (DSB):
*        Make astGetFits<X> public.
*     30-NOV-2005 (DSB):
*        Add support for undefined FITS keyword values.

*        - Include an IMAGFREQ keyword in the output when writing a
*        DSBSpecFrame out using FITS-WCS encoding.
*        - Correct test for constant values in FitOK.
*     7-DEC-2005 (DSB):
*        Free memory allocated by calls to astReadString.
*     30-JAN-2006 (DSB):
*        Modify astSplit so that it does no read the supplied card beyond
*        column 80.
*     14-FEB-2006 (DSB):
*        Override astGetObjSize.
*     28-FEB-2006 (DSB):
*        Correct documentation typo ("NCards" -> "Ncard").
*     5-APR-2006 (DSB):
*        Modify SpecTrans to convert CTYPE="LAMBDA" to CTYPE="WAVE".
*     26-MAY-2006 (DSB):
*        Guard against NULL comment pointer when converting RESTFREQ to
*        RESTFRQ in SpecTrans.
*     29-JUN-2006 (DSB):
*        - Added astRetainFits.
*        - Consume VELOSYS FITS-WCS keywords when reading an object.
*        - Write out VELOSYS FITS-WCS keywords when writing an object.
*     7-AUG-2006 (DSB):
*        Remove trailing spaces from the string returned by astGetFitsS
*        if the original string contains 8 or fewer characters.
*     16-AUG-2006 (DSB):
*        Document non-destructive nature of unsuccessful astRead calls.
*     17-AUG-2006 (DSB):
*        Fix bugs so that the value of the Clean attribute is honoured
*        even if an error has occurred.
*     4-SEP-2006 (DSB):
*        Modify GetClean so that it ignores the inherited status.
*     20-SEP-2006 (DSB):
*        Fix memory leak in WcsSpectral.
*     6-OCT-2006 (DSB):
*        Modify IsSpectral and IsAIPSSpectral to allow for CTYPE values that
*        are shorter than eight characters.
*     13-OCT-2006 (DSB):
*        - Ensure SpecFrames and SkyFrames created from a foreign FITS header
*        are consistent in their choice of Epoch.
*        - Convert MJD-OBS and MJD-AVG values from TIMESYS timescale to
*        TDB before using as the Epoch value in an AstFrame. Use UTC if
*        TIMESYS is absent.
*        - Convert Epoch values from TDB to UTC before storing as the
*        value of an MJD-OBS or MJD-AVG keyword (no TIMESYS keyword is
*        written).
*     23-OCT-2006 (DSB):
*        Prefer MJD-AVG over MJD-OBS.
*     30-OCT-2006 (DSB):
*        In FitOK: Changed lower limit on acceptbale correlation from
*        0.999999 to 0.99999.
*     1-NOV-2006 (DSB):
*        - When reading a foreign header that contains a DUT1 keyword,
*        use it to set the Dut1 attribute in the SkyFrame. Note, JACH
*        store DUT1 in units of days. This may clash with the FITS-WCS
*        standard (when its produced). Also note that DUT1 is not written
*        out as yet when writing a FrameSet to a foreign FITS header.
*        - Correct bug that prevented ZSOURCE keyword being added to the
*        output header if the source velocity was negative.
*     9-NOV-2006 (DSB):
*        Add STATUS argument to docs for F77 AST_SETx.
*     20-DEC-2006 (DSB):
*        Correct FK5 to ICRS in error message issued if no RADESYS or
*        EQUINOX is found.
*     16-JAN-2007 (DSB):
*        Cast ignored function return values to (void) to avoid compiler
*        warnings.
*     31-JAN-2007 (DSB):
*        Change SpecTrans to ignore blank unit strings (previously
*        converted them to "Hz").
*     16-APR-2007 (DSB):
*        In SplitMat, increase the allowed level of rounding erros from
*        1.0E-10 to 1.0E-7 (to avoid spurious low CDi_j values being
*        created that should be zero).
*     30-APR-2007 (DSB):
*        - Change DSBSetup so that the central DSBSpecFrame frequency is
*        CRVAL and the IF is the difference between CRVAL and LO.
*        - Change tolerance in FitOK from 0.99999 to 0.995 to handle data from Nicolas
*        Peretto.
*     1-MAY-2007 (DSB):
*        - In astSplit, if a keyword value looks like an int but is too long to
*         fit in an int, then treat it as a float instead.
*     18-MAY-2007 (DSB):
*        In CnvType, use input type rather than output type when checking
*        for a COMMENT card. Also, return a null data value buffer for a
*        COMMENT card.
*     4-JUN-2007 (DSB):
*        In CLASSFromStore, create a DELTAV header even if it is equal to
*        the spectral CDELT value. Also, convert spatial reference point
*        to (az,el) and write out as headers AZIMUTH and ELEVATIO.
*     9-JUL-2007 (DSB):
*        Fixed bug in DSBSetUp - previously, this function assumed that
*        the supplied DSBSpecFrame represented frequency, and so gave
*        incorrect values for IF and DSBCentre if the header described
*        velocity.
*     9-AUG-2007 (DSB):
*        Changed GetEncoding so that critcal keywords are ignored if
*        there are no CTYPE, CRPIX or CRVAL keywords in the header.
*     10-AUG-2007 (DSB):
*        - Changed GetEncoding so that FITS_PC is not returned if there are
*        any CDi_j or PCi_j keywords in the header.
*        - Added astPurgeWCS method.
*     13-AUG-2007 (DSB):
*        - Include the DSS keywords AMDX%d and AMDY%d in FindWCS.
*     16-AUG-2007 (DSB):
*        - Force all FITS-CLASS headers to contain frequency axes
*        (velocity axes seem not to be recognised properly by CLASS).
*        - Change the CLASS "VELO-LSR" header to be the velocity at the
*        reference channel, not the source velocity.
*     22-AUG-2007 (DSB):
*        - Remove debugging printf statements.
*     20-SEP-2007 (DSB):
*        Changed FitOK to check that the RMS residual is not more than
*        a fixed small fraction of the pixel size.
*     4-DEC-2007 (DSB):
*        Changed CreateKeyword so that it uses a KeyMap to search for
*        existing keywords. This is much faster than checking every
*        FitsCard in the FitsChan explicitly.
*     18-DEC-2007 (DSB):
*        Add keyword VLSR to the CLASS encoding. It holds the same value
*        as VELO-LSR, but different versions of class use different names.
*        Also write out the DELTAV keyword in the LSR rest frame rather
*        than the source rest frame.
*     31-JAN-2008 (DSB):
*        Correct calculation of redshift from radio velocity in ClassTrans.
*     25-FEB-2008 (DSB):
*        Ensure a SkyFrame represents absolute (rather than offset)
*        coords before writing it out in any non-native encoding.
*     28-FEB-2008 (DSB):
*        Test for existing of SkyRefIs attribute before accessing it.
*     2-APR-2008 (DSB):
*        In CLASSFromStore, adjust the spatial CRVAL and CRPIX values to be
*        the centre of the first pixel if the spatial axes are degenerate.
*     17-APR-2008 (DSB):
*        Ignore latitude axis PV terms supplied in a TAN header
*        (previously, such PV terms were used as polynomial correction
*        terms in a TPN projection).
*     30-APR-2008 (DSB):
*        SetValue changed so that new keywords are inserted before the
*        current card.
*     1-MAY-2008 (DSB):
*        Added UndefRead warning.
*     7-MAY-2008 (DSB):
*        Correct conversion of CDi_j to PCi_j/CDELT in SpecTrans.
*     8-MAY-2008 (DSB):
*        When writing out a FITS-WCS header, allow linear grid->WCS
*        mapping to be represented by a CAR projection.
*     9-MAY-2008 (DSB):
*        Make class variables IgnoreUsed and MarkNew static.
*     30-JUN-2008 (DSB):
*        Improve efficiency of FindWcs.
*     2-JUL-2008 (DSB):
*        FitsSof now returns non-zero if the FitsChan is empty.
*     16-JUL-2008 (DSB):
*        Plug memory leak caused by failure to free the Warnings
*        attribute string when a FitsChan is deleted.
*     24-JUL-2008 (TIMJ):
*        Fix buffer overrun in astGetFits when writing the keyword
*        to the buffer (occurred if the input string was 80 characters).
*     1-OCT-2008 (DSB):
*        When reading a FITS-WCS header, spurious PVi_j keywords no
*        longer generate an error. Instead they generate warnings via the
*        new "BadPV" warning type.
*     21-NOV-2008 (DSB):
*        Do not remove keywords from read headers if they may be of
*        relevance to things other than WCS (e.g. MJD-OBS, OBSGEO, etc).
*     2-DEC-2008 (DSB):
*        - astGetFits<X> now reports an error if the keyword value is undefined.
*        - Add new functions astTestFits and astSetFitsU.
*        - Remove use of AST__UNDEF<X> constants.
*        - Remove "undefread" warning.
*     16-JAN-2009 (DSB):
*        Use astAddWarning to store each warning in the parent Channel
*        structure.
*     4-MAR-2009 (DSB):
*        DATE-OBS and MJD-OBS cannot have an axis description character.
*     13-MAR-2009 (DSB):
*        The VELOSYS value read from the header is never used, so do not
*        report an error if VELOSYS has an undefined value.
*     11-JUN-2009 (DSB):
*        Delay reading cards from the source until they are actually
*        needed. Previously, the source function was called in the
*        FitsChan initialiser, but this means it is not possible for
*        application code to call astPutChannelData before the source
*        function is called. The ReadFromSource function is now called
*        at the start of each (nearly) public or protected function to
*        ensure the source function has been called (the source function
*        pointer in the FitsChan is then nullified to ensure it is not
*        called again).
*     18-JUN-2009 (DSB):
*        Include the effect of observer height (in the ObsAlt attribute)
*        when creating OBSGEO-X/Y/Z headers, and store a value for
*        ObsAlt when reading a set of OBSGEO-X/Y/Z headers.
*     2-JUL-2009 (DSB):
*        Check FitsChan is not empty at start of FindWcs.
*     7-JUL-2009 (DSB):
*        Add new function astSetFitsCM.
*     30-JUL-2009 (DSB):
*        Fix axis numbering in SkyPole.
*     12-FEB-2010 (DSB):
*        Use "<bad>" to represent AST__BAD externally.
*     25-JUN-2010 (DSB):
*        Fix problem rounding lots of 9's in RoundFString. The problem
*        only affected negative values, and could lead to an extra zero
*        being included in the integer part.
*     28-JUN-2010 (DSB):
*        Another problem in RoundFString! If the value has a series of
*        9's followed by a series of zeros, with no decimal point (e.g.
*        "260579999000"), then the trailing zeros were being lost.
*     16-JUL-2010 (DSB):
*        In SpecTrans, avoid over-writing the spatial projection code
*        with the spectral projection code.
*     20-JUL-2010 (DSB):
*        Correct interpretation of NCP projection code.
*     14-OCT-2010 (DSB):
*        - Correct loading of FitsChans that contain UNDEF keywords.
*        - Correct translation of spectral units with non-standard
*        capitalisation in SpecTrans.
*     10-JAN-2011 (DSB):
*        Fix memory leak in MakeIntWorld.
*     13-JAN-2011 (DSB):
*        Rename astEmpty ast astEmptyFits and make public.
*     20-JAN-2011 (DSB):
*        - Extensive changes to support -TAB algorithm
*        - Recovery from a major unrequested reformatting of whitespace by
*        my editor!
*     7-FEB-2011 (DSB):
*        Put a space between keyword value and slash that starts a comment
*        when formatting a FITS header card.
*     11-FEB-2011 (DSB):
*        Change meaning of TabOK attribute. It is no longer a simple
*        boolean indicating if the -TAB algorithm is supported. Instead
*        it gives the value to be used for the EXTVER header - i.e. the
*        version number to store with any binary table created as a
*        result of calling astWrite. If TabOK is zero or begative, then
*        the -TAB algorithm is not supported. This is so that there is
*        some way of having multiple binary table extensions with the same
*        name (but different EXTVER values).
*     14-FEB-2011 (DSB):
*        - Spectral reference point CRVAL records the obs. centre. So for -TAB
*        (when CRVAL is set to zero) we need to record the obs centre some
*        other way (use the AST-specific AXREF keywords, as for spatial axes).
*        - Whether to scale spatial axes from degs to rads depends on
*        whether the spatial axes are descirbed by -TAB or not.
*        - Relax the linearity requirement in IsMapLinear by a factor of
*        10 to prevent a change in rest frame resulting in a non-linear
*        mapping.
*     17-FEB-2011 (DSB):
*        Fix bug in axis linearity check (IsMapLinear).
*     22-FEB-2011 (DSB):
*        The translations of AIPS non-standard CTYPE values were always
*        stored as primary axis description keywords, even if the original
*        non-standard CTYPE values were read from an alternative axis
*        descriptions.
*     5-APR-2011 (DSB):
*        In SpecTrans, correct the MSX CAR projection translation. The
*        first pixel starts at GRID=0.5, not GRID=0.0. So the CRPIX value
*        needs to be reduced by 0.5 prior to normalisation, and then
*        increased by 0.5 after normalisation.
*     23-MAY-2011 (DSB):
*        Add support for TNX projections that use Chebyshev polynomials.
*     24-MAY-2011 (DSB):
*        - Add support for ZPX projections that include IRAF polynomial
*        corrections.
*        - Add PolyTan attribute.
*        - Fix interpretation of -SIP headers that have no inverse.
*     1-JUN-2011 (DSB):
*        In astInitFitsChanVtab, only create the two TimeFrames if they
*        have not already been created (fixes scuba2 trac ticket #666).
*     9-JUN-2011 (DSB):
*        In WCSFcRead, ignore trailing spaces when reading string values
*        for WCS keywords.
*     23-JUN-2011 (DSB):
*        - Override the parent astSetSourceFile method so that it reads
*        headers from the SourceFile and appends them to the end of the
*        FitsChan.
*        - On deletion, write out the FitsChan contents to the file
*        specified by the SinkFile attribute. If no file is specified,
*        use the sink function specified when the FitsChan was created.
*     30-AUG-2011 (DSB):
*        - Added astWriteFits and astReadFits.
*        - Move the deletion of tables and warnings from Delete to
*        EmptyFits.
*     21-SEP-2011 (DSB):
*        - In RoundFString, remember to update the pointer to the exponent.
*        This bug caused parts of the exponent to dissappear when
*        formatting a value that included some trailing zeros and a
*        series of adjacent 9's.
*        - Added Nkey attribute.
*     22-SEP-2011 (DSB):
*        - Added CardType attribute
*        - Allow GetFits to be used to get/set the value of the current
*        card.
*     4-OCT-2011 (DSB):
*        When reading a FITS-WCFS header, if the projection is TPV (as produced
*        by SCAMP), change to TPN (the internal AST code for a distorted
*        TAN projection).
*     22-NOV-2011 (DSB):
*        Allow the "-SIP" code to be used with non-celestial axes.
*     1-FEB-2012 (DSB):
*        Write out MJD-OBS in the timescale specified by any TIMESYS
*        keyword in the FitsChan, and ensure the TIMESYS value is included
*        in the output header.
*     23-FEB-2012 (DSB):
*        Use iauGd2gc in place of palGeoc where is saves some calculations.
*     24-FEB-2012 (DSB):
*        Move invocation of AddEncodingFrame from Write to end of
*        MakeFitsFrameSet. This is so that AddEncodingFrame can take
*        advantage of any standardisations (such as adding celestial axes)
*        performed by MakeFItsFrameSet. Without this, a FRameSet contain
*        a 1D SpecFrame (no celestial axes) would fail to be exported using
*        FITS-CLASS encoding.
*     29-FEB-2012 (DSB):
*        Fix bug in CLASSFromStore that caused spatial axes added by
*        MakeFitsFrameSet to be ignored.
*     2-MAR-2012 (DSB):
*        - In CLASSFromSTore, ensure NAXIS2/3 values are stored in teh FitsChan,
*        and cater for FrameSets that have only a apectral axis and no celestial
*        axes (this prevented the VELO_LSR keyword being created)..
*     7-MAR-2012 (DSB):
*        Use iauGc2gd in place of Geod.
*     22-JUN-2012 (DSB):
*        - Check for distorted TAN projections that have zero for all PVi_m
*        coefficients. Issue a warning and ignore the distortion in such
*        cases.
*        - Remove all set but unused variables.
*        - Convert SAO distorted TAN projections (which use COi_j keywords
*        for polynomial coeffs) to TPN.
*     26-JUN-2012 (DSB):
*        Correct call to astKeyFields in SAOTrans (thanks to Bill Joye
*        for pointing out this error).
*     8-AUG-2012 (DSB):
*        Correct assignment to lonpole within CLASSFromStore.
*     10-AUG-2012 (DSB):
*        Default DSS keywords CNPIX1 and CNPIX2 to zero if they are
*        absent, rather than reporting an error.
*     7-DEC-2012 (DSB):
*        - When writing out a FrameSet that uses an SkyFrame to describe a
*        generalised spherical coordinate system ("system=unknown"), ensure
*        that the generated FITS CTYPE values use FITS-compliant codes
*        for the axis type ( "xxLN/xxLT" or "xLON/xLAT" ).
*        - Add support for reading and writing offset SkyFrames to
*        FITS-WCS.
*     30-JAN-2013 (DSB):
*        When reading a FITS-CLASS header, use "VLSR" keyword if
*        "VELO-..." is not available.
*     15-APR-2013 (DSB):
*        Correct initialisation of missing coefficients When reading a
*        SAO plate solution header.
*     16-APR-2013 (DSB):
*        When determining default Encoding value, use "VLSR" keyword if
*        "VELO-..." is not available.
*     30-MAY-2013 (DSB):
*        Prevent seg fault caused by overrunning the coeffs array in
*        WATCoeffs in cases where the TNX/ZPX projection is found to be
*        of a form that cannot be implemented as a TPN projection.
*     11-JUN-2013 (DSB):
*        Fix support for reading GLS projections, and add support for
*        rotated GLS projections.
*     28-AUG-2013 (DSB):
*        In WcsCelestial, if celestial axes are found with no projection
*        code in CTYPE, assume an old-fashioned CAR projection (i.e. no
*        rotation from native to WCS coords). Before this change,
*        CTYPE = "RA" | "DEC" axes got treated as radians, not degrees.
*     16-SEP-2013 (DSB):
*        When exporting alternate offset SkyFrames to FITS-WCS headers,
*        correctly test the alternate Frame in the supplied FrameSet, rather
*        than the current Frame.
*     24-SEP-2013 (DSB):
*        Fix bug in choosing default value for PolyTan attribute.
*     19-OCT-2013 (DSB):
*        - In SIPMapping, always ignore any inverse polynomial supplied in
*        a SIP header as they seem often to be inaccurate. A new inverse is
*        created to replace it.
*        - In SIPMapping, only use a fit to the inverted SIP transformation
*        if an accuracy of 0.01 pixel can be achieved over an area three
*        times the dimensions of the image. Otherwise use an iterative
*        inverse for each point. People were seeing bad round-trip errors
*        when transforming points outside the image because the fit was
*        being used when it was not very accurate.
*     12-NOV-2013 (DSB):
*        Added CardName and CardComm attributes.
*     13-NOV-2013 (DSB):
*        Use a zero-length string for the CardComm attribute if the card
*        has no comment.
*     15-NOV-2013 (DSB):
*        - Added method astShowFits.
*        - Ensure PurgeWcs removes WCS cards even if an error occurs when
*        reading FrameSets from the FitsChan.
*        - Change IsMapTab1D to improve chances of a -TAB mapping being found.
*     6-JAN-2014 (DSB):
*        - Allow default options for newly created FitsChans to be
*        specified by the FITSCHAN_OPTIONS environment variable.
*        - Ensure the used CarLin value is not changed by a trailing frequency axis.
*     9-JUL-2014 (DSB):
*        Added attribute FitsAxisOrder, which allows an order to be
*        specified for WCS axis within FITS headers generated using astWrite.
*     9-SEP-2014 (DSB):
*        Modify Split so that any non-printing characters such as
*        newlines at the end of the string are ignored.
*     30-SEP-2014 (DSB):
*        Modify CnvType to indicate that comment cards cannot be
*        converted to any other data type. For instance, this causes
*        a warning to be issued if an equals sign is misplaced in a
*        WCS-related card (causing it to be treated as a comment card).
*     24-MAR-2015 (DSB):
*        Modify SpecTrans to avoid modifying the CRPIC value for CAR
*        projections when they do not need to be modified. The princiuple
*        is that the bulk of the array should be witin the native longitude
*        range [-180,+180]. Prompted by bug report from Bill Joye "yet
*        another CAR issue" on 24-MAR-2015 (file CHIPASS_Equ.head in
*        ast_tester).
*     27-APR-2015 (DSB):
*        Modify MakeFitsFrameSet so that isolated SkyAxes (e.g.
*        individual axes that have been oicked from a SkyFrame) are
*        re-mapped into degrees before being used.
*     20-APR-2015 (DSB):
*        In MakeIntWorld, relax tolerance for checking that each FITS-WCS IWC
*        axis is linear, from 0.01 of a pixel to 0.1 of a pixel.
*     6-JUL-2015 (DSB):
*        When checking a sub-string, ensure the whole string is at least as
*        long as the offset to the start of the sub-string. Without this, you
*        can get erroneous sub-string matches by chance, depending on what
*        characters happen to be present in memory after the end of the string.
*     11-AUG-2015 (DSB):
*        - Fix bug in CheckFitsName that prevented an error from being reported
*        if the FITS keyword name contained any illegal printable characters.
*        - Add new Warning "badkeyname", and issue such a warning instead
*        of an error if illegal characters are found in a keyword name.
*     31-AUG-2015 (DSB):
*        In FitLine, use the whole axis rather than 0.1 of the axis (if "dim" 
*        is supplied). This is because non-linearity can become greater at 
*        further distances along the axis. In practice, it meant that SIP 
*        distortion were being treated as linear because the test did not 
*        explore a large enough region of pixel space.

   cards, and they should not be written out when the FitsChan is deleted.
   This flag was the only flag available in AST V1.4, and was called
   "Del" (for "deleted"). Used cards are retained in order to give an

   "provisionally used" will be changed to be flagged as "definitely used"
   (using the USED flag). If the Object fails to be constructed

   the requested encoding, all "new" cards which were added before the

/*
*  Name:
*     AdaptLut

*  Purpose:
*     Create a table of optimally sampled values for a Mapping.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     void AdaptLut( AstMapping *map, int npos, double eps, double x0,
*                    double x1, double v0, double v1, double **xtab,
*                    double **vtab, int *nsamp, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     This function returns a look-up table holding samples of the supplied
*     1D mapping. The input values at which the samples are taken are
*     returned in the "xtab" array, and the Mapping output values at
*     these input values are returned in the "vtab" array. The sample
*     spacing is smaller at positions where the output gradient is
*     changing more rapidly (i.e. where the output is more non-linear).

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        Pointer to the Mapping. Should have 1 input and 1 output.
*     npos
*        The minimum number of samples to place within the interval to be
*         sampled, excluding the two end points (which are always sampeld
*         anyway). These samples are placed evenly through the [x0,x1]
          interval. The interval between adjacent samples will be further
*         subdivided if necessary by calling this function recursively.
*     eps
*        The maximum error in X (i.e. the Mapping input) allowed before
*        the supplied interval is subdivided further by a recursive call
*        to this function.
*     x0
*        The Mapping input value at the start of the interval to be sampled.
*        It is assumed that this value is already stored in (*xtab)[0] on
*        entry.
*     x1
*        The Mapping input value at the end of the interval to be sampled.
*     v0
*        The Mapping output value at the start of the interval to be sampled.
*        It is assumed that this value is already stored in (*vtab)[0] on
*        entry.
*     v1
*        The Mapping output value at the end of the interval to be sampled.
*     xtab
*        Address of a pointer to the array in which to store the Mapping
*        input values at which samples were taken. The supplied pointer
*        may be changed on exit to point to a larger array. New values
*        are added to the end of this array. The initial size of the array
*        is given by the supplied value for "*nsamp"
*     vtab
*        Address of a pointer to the array in which to store the Mapping
*        output value at each sample. The supplied pointer may be changed
*        on exit to point to a larger array. New values are added to the
*        end of this array. The initial size of the array is given by the
*        supplied value for "*nsamp".
*     nsamp
*        Address of an int holding the number of values in the "*xtab"
*        and "*ytab" arrays. Updated on exit to include the new values
*        added to the arrays by this function.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     The size of the returned xtab and vtab arrays.

/*
*  Name:

*  Purpose:

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:

*     int AIPSFromStore( AstFitsChan *this, FitsStore *store,
*                        const char *method, const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function copies the WCS information stored in the supplied
*     FitsStore into the supplied FitsChan, using FITS-AIPS encoding.
*
*     AIPS encoding is like FITS-WCS encoding but with the following
*     restrictions:
*
*     1) The celestial projection must not have any projection parameters
*     which are not set to their default values. The one exception to this
*     is that SIN projections are acceptable if the associated projection
*     parameter PV<axlat>_1 is zero and PV<axlat>_2 = cot( reference point
*     latitude). This is encoded using the string "-NCP". The SFL projection
*     is encoded using the string "-GLS". Note, the original AIPS WCS
*     system only recognised a small subset of the currently available
*     projections, but some more recent AIPS-like software recognizes some
*     of the new projections included in the FITS-WCS encoding. The AIT,
*     GLS and MER can only be written if the CRVAL keywords are zero for
*     both longitude and latitude axes.
*
*     2) The celestial axes must be RA/DEC, galactic or ecliptic.
*
*     3) LONPOLE and LATPOLE must take their default values.
*
*     4) Only primary axis descriptions are written out.
*
*     5) EPOCH is written instead of EQUINOX & RADECSYS, and uses the
*        IAU 1984 rule ( EPOCH < 1984.0 is treated as a Besselian epoch
*        and implies RADECSYS=FK4,  EPOCH >= 1984.0 is treated as a
*        Julian epoch and implies RADECSYS=FK5). The RADECSYS & EQUINOX
*        values in the FitsStore must be consistent with this rule.
*
*     6) Any rotation produced by the PC matrix must be restricted to
*        the celestial plane, and must involve no shear. A CROTA keyword
*        with associated CDELT values are produced instead of the PC
*        matrix.
*
*     7) ICRS is not supported.
*
*     8) Spectral axes can be created only for FITS-WCS CTYPE values of "FREQ"
*        "VRAD" and "VOPT-F2W" and with standards of rest of LSRK, LSRD,
*        BARYCENT and GEOCENTR.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A value of 1 is returned if succesfull, and zero is returned
*     otherwise.

/*
*  Name:
*     AIPSPPFromStore

*  Purpose:
*     Store WCS keywords in a FitsChan using FITS-AIPS++ encoding.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:

*     int AIPSPPFromStore( AstFitsChan *this, FitsStore *store,
*                        const char *method, const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function copies the WCS information stored in the supplied
*     FitsStore into the supplied FitsChan, using FITS-AIPS++ encoding.
*
*     AIPS++ encoding is like FITS-WCS encoding but with the following
*     restrictions:
*
*     1) The celestial axes must be RA/DEC, galactic or ecliptic.
*
*     2) Only primary axis descriptions are written out.
*
*     3) RADESYS is not written and so the RADECSYS & EQUINOX values in the
*        FitsStore must be consistent with the "1984" rule.
*
*     4) Any rotation produced by the PC matrix must be restricted to
*        the celestial plane, and must involve no shear. A CROTA keyword
*        with associated CDELT values are produced instead of the PC
*        matrix.
*
*     5) ICRS is not supported.
*
*     6) Spectral axes can be created only for FITS-WCS CTYPE values of "FREQ"
*        "VRAD" and "VOPT-F2W" and with standards of rest of LSRK, LSRD,
*        BARYCENT and GEOCENTR.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A value of 1 is returned if succesfull, and zero is returned
*     otherwise.

*     representing IWC. The IWC Frame has the same number of axes as the
*     WCS Frame which may be greater than the number of base Frame (i.e.
*     pixel) axes.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     fs
*        Pointer to the FrameSet. The base Frame should represent FITS pixel
*        coordinates, and the current Frame should represent FITS WCS
*        coordinates. The number of base Frame axes should not exceed the
*        number of current Frame axes.
*     dim
*        An array holding the image dimensions in pixels. AST__BAD can be
*        supplied for any unknown dimensions.
*     wperm
*        Pointer to an array of integers with one element for each axis of
*        the current Frame. Each element holds the zero-based
*        index of the FITS-WCS axis (i.e. the value of "i" in the keyword
*        names "CTYPEi", "CRVALi", etc) which describes the Frame axis.
*     s
*        The co-ordinate version character. A space means the primary
*        axis descriptions. Otherwise the supplied character should be
*        an upper case alphabetical character ('A' to 'Z').
*     store
*        The FitsStore in which to store the FITS WCS keyword values.
*     axis_done
*        An array of flags, one for each Frame axis, which indicate if a
*        description of the corresponding axis has yet been stored in the
*        FitsStore.
*     isoff
*        If greater than zero, the description to add to the FitsStore
*        should describe offset coordinates. If less than zero, the
*        description to add to the FitsStore should describe absolute
*        coordinates but should include the SkyRefIs, SkyRef and SkyRefP
*        attributes. If zero, ignore all offset coordinate info. The
*        absolute value indicates the nature of the reference point:
*        1 == "pole", 2 == "origin", otherwise "ignored".
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     If celestial axes were found which can be described using the
*     conventions of FITS-WCS paper II, then a Mapping from the current Frame
*     of the supplied FrameSet, to the IWC Frame is returned. Otherwise,
*     a UnitMap is returned. Note, the Mapping only defines the IWC
*     transformation for celestial axes. Any non-celestial axes are passed
*     unchanged by the returned Mapping.

*  Notes:
*     -  When converting from floating point to integer, the  floating

*     -  Non-zero numerical values are considered TRUE, and zero
*     numerical values are considered FALSE. Any string starting with a
*     'T' or a 'Y' (upper or lower case) is considered TRUE, and anything
*     starting with an 'F' or an 'N' (upper or lower case) is considered
*     FALSE. In addition, a dot ('.') may be placed in front of a 'T' or an
*     'F'.
*     -  A logical TRUE value is represented as a real numerical value of
*     one and the character string "Y". A logical FALSE value is represented
*     by a real numerical value of zero and the character string "N".
*     -  When converting from a string to any numerical value, zero is
*     returned if the string is not a formatted value which can be converted
*     into the corresponding type using astSscanf.
*     - Real and imaginary parts of a complex value should be separated by
*     spaces within strings. If a string does contains only a single numerical
*     value, it is assumed to be the real part, and the imaginary part is
*     assumed to be zero.
*     -  When converting a complex numerical type to a non-complex numerical

*     -  Zero is returned if an error has occurred, or if this function
*     should fail for any reason.
*     - If the supplied value is undefined an error will be reported.

*
*  Name:
*     CnvType

*  Purpose:
*     Convert a data value into a given FITS data type.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     int CnvType( int otype, void *odata, size_t osize, int type, int undef,
*                   void *buff, const char *name, const char *method,
*                   const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan method.

*  Description:
*     This function produces a copy of the data value for the current card
*     converted from its stored data type to the supplied data type.

*  Parameters:
*     otype
*        The type of the supplied data value.
*     odata
*        Pointer to a buffer holding the supplied data value.
*     osize
*        The size of the data value (in bytes - strings include the
*        terminating null).
*     type
*        The FITS data type in which to return the data value of the
*        current card.
*     undef
*        Determines what happens if the supplied data value type is
*        undefined If "undef" is zero, an error will be reported identifying
*        the undefined keyword value. If "undef" is non-zero, no error is
*        reported and the contents of the output buffer are left unchanged.
*     buff
*        A pointer to a buffer to recieve the converted value. It is the
*        responsibility of the caller to ensure that a suitable buffer is
*        supplied.
*     name
*        A pointer to a string holding a keyword name to include in error
*        messages.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     Zero if the conversion was not possible (in which case NO error is
*     reported), one otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  When converting from floating point to integer, the  floating
*     point value is truncated using a C cast.
*     -  Non-zero numerical values are considered TRUE, and zero
*     numerical values are considered FALSE. Any string starting with a
*     'T' or a 'Y' (upper or lower case) is considered TRUE, and anything
*     starting with an 'F' or an 'N' (upper or lower case) is considered
*     FALSE. In addition, a dot ('.') may be placed in front of a 'T' or an
*     'F'.
*     -  A logical TRUE value is represented as a real numerical value of
*     one and the character string "Y". A logical FALSE value is represented
*     by a real numerical value of zero and the character string "N".
*     -  When converting from a string to any numerical value, zero is
*     returned if the string isn not a formatted value which can be converted
*     into the corresponding type using astSscanf.
*     - Real and imaginary parts of a complex value should be separated by
*     spaces within strings. If a string does contains only a single numerical
*     value, it is assumed to be the real part, and the imaginary part is
*     assumed to be zero.
*     -  When converting a complex numerical type to a non-complex numerical
*     type, the returned value is derived from the real part only, the
*     imaginary part is ignored.
*     -  Zero is returned if an error has occurred, or if this function
*     should fail for any reason.

/*
*  Name:
*     ComBlock

*  Purpose:
*     Delete a AST comment block in a Native-encoded FitsChan.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"

*     int ComBlock( AstFitsChan *this, int incr, const char *method,
*                   const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     This function looks for a block of comment cards as defined below,
*     and deletes all the cards in the block, if a suitable block is found.
*
*     Comment blocks consist of a contiguous sequence of COMMENT cards. The
*     text of each card should start and end with the 3 characters "AST".
*     The block is delimited above by a card containing all +'s (except
*     for the two "AST" strings), and below by a card containing all -'s.
*
*     The block is assumed to start on the card which is adjacent to the
*     current card on entry.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     incr
*        This should be either +1 or -1, and is the increment between
*        adjacent cards in the comment block. A value of +1 means
*        that the card following the current card is taken as the first in
*        the block, and subsequent cards are checked. The block must then
*        end with a line of -'s. If -1 is supplied, then the card
*        preceding the current card is taken as the first in the block,
*        and preceding cards are checked. The block must then end with
*        a row of +'s.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     1 if a block was found and deleted, 0 otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  The pointer to the current card is returned unchanged.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     This function takes a name which forms the basis of a FITS
*     keyword and appends a sequence number (encoded as a pair of
*     legal FITS keyword characters) so as to generate a unique FITS
*     keyword which has not previously been used in the FitsChan
*     supplied.
*
*     It is intended for use when several keywords with the same name
*     must be stored in a FitsChan, since to comply strictly with the
*     FITS standard keywords should normally be unique (otherwise
*     external software which processes the keywords might omit one or
*     other of the values).
*
*     An attempt is also made to generate keywords in a form that is
*     unlikely to clash with those from other sources (in as far as
*     this is possible with FITS). In any event, a keyword that
*     already appears in the FitsChan will not be re-used.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        name on which the new keyword should be based. This should be
*        a legal FITS keyword in itself, except that it should be at
*        least two characters shorter than the maximum length, in
*        order to accommodate the sequence number characters.
*
*        If this string is too long, it will be silently
*        truncated. Mixed case is permitted, as all characters
*        supplied are converted to upper case before use.
*     keyword
*        A character array in which the generated unique keyword will
*        be returned, null terminated.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Description:
*     This function formats the value using a G format specified in order

*     However, the G specifier does not include a decimal point unless it
*     is necessary. FITS requires that floating point values always include
*     a decimal point, so this function inserts one, if necessary.

*  Parameters:
*     buf
*        A character string into which the value is written.
*     digits
*        The number of digits after the decimal point. If the supplied value
*        is negative, the number of digits actually used may be reduced if
*        the string would otherwise extend beyond the number of columns
*        allowed by the FITS standard. If the value is positive, the
*        specified number of digits are always produced, even if it means
*        breaking the FITS standard.
*     width
*        The minimum field width to use. The value is right justified in
*        this field width.
*     maxwidth
*        The maximum field width to use. A value of zero is returned if
*        the maximum field width is exceeded.
*     value
*        The value to format.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     The field width actually used, or zero if the value could not be
*     formatted. This does not include the trailing null character.

*  Notes:
*     -  If there is room, a trailing zero is also added following the

*  Description:
*     This function examines the supplied Mapping; if the specified output
*     coordinate of the Mapping is created directly by an un-inverted GrismMap,
*     then a pointer to the GrismMap is returned as the function value. A new
*     Mapping is also returned via parameter "new_map" which is a copy of
*     the supplied Mapping, except that the GrismMap is replaced with a
*     UnitMap. If no GrismMap is found, NULL is returned for both Mappings.
*     The condition that "the specified output coordinate of the Mapping is
*     created directly by an un-inverted GrismMap" means that the output
*     of the GrismMap is no subsequently modified by any further Mappings
*     before being returned as the "iax"th output of the supplied Mapping.
*     This means the GrismMap must be "at the end of" a CmpMap, not in
*     the middle of the CmpMap.

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        Pointer to the Mapping to check.
*     iax
*        The index for the output coordinate to be checked.
*     new_map
*        Pointer to a location at which to return a pointer to a new

*     or spectral position.

*  Parameters:
*     store
*        A structure containing values for FITS keywords relating to
*        the World Coordinate System.
*     s
*        A character identifying the co-ordinate version to use. A space
*        means use primary axis descriptions. Otherwise, it must be an
*        upper-case alphabetical characters ('A' to 'Z').
*     axlon
*        Address of a location at which to return the index of the
*        longitude axis (if found). This is the value of "i" within the
*        keyword name "CTYPEi". A value of -1 is returned if no longitude
*        axis is found.
*     axlat
*        Address of a location at which to return the index of the
*        latitude axis (if found). This is the value of "i" within the
*        keyword name "CTYPEi". A value of -1 is returned if no latitude
*        axis is found.
*     axspec
*        Address of a location at which to return the index of the
*        spectral axis (if found). This is the value of "i" within the
*        keyword name "CTYPEi". A value of -1 is returned if no spectral
*        axis is found.
*     method
*        A pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     class
*        A pointer to a string holding the class of the object being
*        read. This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     One is returned if both celestial axes were found. Zero is returned if
*     either axis was not found. The presence of a spectral axis does not
*     affect the returned value.

*  Notes:
*     -  If an error occurs, zero is returned.

*     corresponding values estimated by some fitting process. It tests
*     that the RMS residual between them is no more than "tol".

*  Parameters:
*     n
*        Number of data points.
*     act
*        Pointer to the start of the actual data values.
*     est
*        Pointer to the start of the estimated data values.
*     tol
*        The largest acceptable RMS error between "act" and "est".
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A value of 1 is returned if the two sets of values agree. Zero is
*     returned otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  Zero is returned if an error occurs.

*  Description:
*     This function returns an array indicating the order of the WCS axes

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     nwcs
*        The number of axes in "wcsfrm".
*     wcsfrm
*        The Frame containing the output WCS axes.
*     perm
*        Pointer to an array of "nwcs" integers. On exit, element "k"
*        of this array holds the zero-based index of the FITS-WCS axis
*        (i.e. one less than the value of "i" in the keyword names
*        "CTYPEi", "CRVALi", etc) that describes the k'th axis in "wcsfrm".
*        In other words, "perm[ast_index] = fits_index". The order is
*        determined by the FitsAxisOrder attribute. If this attribute is
*        "<copy>" or "<auto>", then "perm[k]=k" for all k on exit (i.e.
*        a unit mapping between axes in "wcsfrm" and the FITS header).
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     Returns zero if the FitsAxisOrder attribute is "<auto">, and
*     non-zero otherwise. This is a flag indicating if the returned
*     values in "perm" can be used s they are.

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function creates a new FrameSet containing WCS information
*     stored in the supplied FitsStore. A null pointer is returned and no
*     error is reported if this is not possible.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The FitsChan from which the keywords were read. Warning messages
*        are added to this FitsChan if the celestial co-ordinate system is
*        not recognized.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new FrameSet, or a null pointer if no FrameSet
*     could be constructed.

*  Notes:
*     -  The pixel Frame is given a title of "Pixel Coordinates", and
*     each axis in the pixel Frame is given a label of the form "Pixel
*     axis <n>", where <n> is the axis index (starting at one).
*     -  The FITS CTYPE keyword values are used to set the labels for any
*     non-celestial axes in the physical coordinate Frames, and the FITS
*     CUNIT keywords are used to set the corresponding units strings.
*     -  On exit, the pixel Frame is the base Frame, and the physical
*     Frame derived from the primary axis descriptions is the current Frame.
*     - Extra Frames are added to hold any secondary axis descriptions. All
*     axes within such a Frame refer to the same coordinate version ('A',
*     'B', etc).

*     i
*        The zero based intermediate axis index in the range 0 to 98. Set

*     s
*        The co-ordinate version character (A to Z, or space), case
*        insensitive
*     name
*        A string holding a name for the item of information. A NULL
*        pointer may be supplied, in which case it is ignored. If a
*        non-NULL pointer is supplied, an error is reported if the item

*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.

*  Description:
*     If a table source function has been registered with FitsChan (using

*     FITS file. If the extension is available in the FITS file, this will

*
*     This strategy allows the astPutTables or astPutTable method to be used
*     as an alternative to registering a table source function with the
*     FitsChan.  Note, any table read using the source function is used
*     in preference to any table stored in the FitsChan by an earlier call
*     to astPutTables/astPutTable.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     extname
*        The key associated with the required table - should be the name
*        of the FITS extension containing the binary table.
*     extver
*        The FITS "EXTVER" value for the required table.
*     extlevel
*        The FITS "EXTLEVEL" value for the required table.
*     report
*        If non-zero, report an error if the named table is not available.
*     method

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan method.

*  Description:
*     This function returns the number of cards within a FitsChan which
*     refer to keywords which match the supplied filter template. If the
*     filter contains any integer field specifiers (e.g. "%d", "%3d", etc),
*     it also returns the upper and lower bounds found for the integer
*     fields.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     filter
*        The filter string.
*     maxfld
*        The size of the "ubnd" and "lbnd" arrays.
*     ubnd
*        A pointer to an integer array in which to return the
*        upper bound found for each integer field in the filter.
*        They are stored in the order in which they occur in the filter.
*        If the filter contains too many fields to fit in the supplied
*        array, the excess trailing fields are ignored.
*     lbnd
*        A pointer to an integer array in which to return the
*        lower bound found for each integer field in the filter.

*  Returned Value:
*     astKeyFields()
*        The total number of cards matching the supplied filter in the
*        FitsChan.

*  Filter Syntax:
*     -  The criteria for a keyword name to match a filter template are
*     as follows:
*     -  All characters in the template other than "%" (and the field width
*     and type specifiers which follow a "%") must be matched by an
*     identical character in the test string.
      -  If a "%" occurs in the template, then the next character in the
*     template should be a single digit specifying a field width. If it is
*     zero, then the test string may contain zero or more matching characters.
*     Otherwise, the test string must contain exactly the specified number
*     of matching characters (i.e. 1 to 9). The field width digit may be
*     omitted, in which case the test string must contain one or more matching
*     characters. The next character in the template specifies the type of
*     matching characters and must be one of "d", "c" or "f". Decimal digits
*     are matched by "d", all upper (but not lower) case alphabetical
*     characters are matched by "c", and all characters which may legally be
*     found within a FITS keyword name are matched by "f".

*  Examples:
*     -  The filter "CRVAL1" accepts the single keyword CRVAL1.
*     -  The filter "CRVAL%1d" accepts the single keyword CRVAL0, CRVAL1,
*     CRVAL2, up to CRVAL9.
*     -  The filter "CRVAL%d" accepts any keyword consisting of the string
*     "CRVAL" followed by any integer value.
*     -  The filter "CR%0s1" accepts any keyword starting with the string "CR"
*     and ending with the character "1" (including CR1).

*  Notes:
*     -  The entire FitsChan is searched, irrespective of the setting of
*     the Card attribute.
*     -  If "maxfld" is supplied as zero, "ubnd" and "lbnd" are ignored,
*     but the number of matching cards is still returned as the function value.
*     -  If no matching cards are found in the FitsChan, or if there are no
*     integer fields in the filter, then the lower and upper bounds are
*     returned as zero and -1 (i.e. reversed).
*     -  If an error has already occured, or if this function should fail
*     for any reason, a value of zero is returned for the function value,
*     and the lower and upper bounds are set to zero and -1.

*  Description:
*     This function searches for a card in a FitsChan by keyword. The

*     attribute) and ends when a card is found whose FITS keyword
*     matches the template supplied, or when the last card in the

*
*     If the search is successful (i.e. a card is found which matches
c     the template), the contents of the card are (optionally)
f     the template), the contents of the card are
*     returned and the Card attribute is adjusted to identify the card

f        that was found. If it is .TRUE., however, the Card
*        attribute will be incremented to identify the card which
*        follows the one found.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:

f     AST_FINDFITS = LOGICAL
c        One if the search was successful, otherwise zero.
f        .TRUE. if the search was successful, otherwise .FALSE..

*  Notes:
*     - The search always starts with the current card, as identified
*     by the Card attribute. To ensure you search the entire contents
*     of a FitsChan, you should first clear the Card attribute (using
c     astClear). This effectively "rewinds" the FitsChan.
f     AST_CLEAR). This effectively "rewinds" the FitsChan.
*     - If a search is unsuccessful, the Card attribute is set to the
*     "end-of-file" (i.e. to one more than the number of cards in the
*     FitsChan). No error occurs.
c     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
f     - A value of .FALSE. will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the AST error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Examples:
c     result = astFindFits( fitschan, "%f", card, 1 );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFITS( FITSCHAN, '%f', CARD, .TRUE., STATUS )
*        Returns the current card in a FitsChan and advances the Card
*        attribute to identify the card that follows (the "%f"
*        template matches any keyword).
c     result = astFindFits( fitschan, "BITPIX", card, 1 );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFITS( FITSCHAN, 'BITPIX', CARD, .TRUE., STATUS )
*        Searches a FitsChan for a FITS card with the "BITPIX" keyword
*        and returns that card. The Card attribute is then incremented
*        to identify the card that follows it.
c     result = astFindFits( fitschan, "COMMENT", NULL, 0 );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFITS( FITSCHAN, 'COMMENT', CARD, .FALSE., STATUS )
*        Sets the Card attribute of a FitsChan to identify the next
c        COMMENT card (if any). The card itself is not returned.
f        COMMENT card (if any) and returns that card.
c     result = astFindFits( fitschan, "CRVAL%1d", card, 1 );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFITS( FITSCHAN, 'CRVAL%1d', CARD, .TRUE., STATUS )
*        Searches a FitsChan for the next card with a keyword of the
*        form "CRVALi" (for example, any of the keywords "CRVAL1",
*        "CRVAL2" or "CRVAL3" would be matched). The card found (if
*        any) is returned, and the Card attribute is then incremented
*        to identify the following card (ready to search for another
*        keyword with the same form, perhaps).

*  Keyword Templates:
*     The templates used to match FITS keywords are normally composed
*     of literal characters, which must match the keyword exactly
*     (apart from case). However, a template may also contain "field
*     specifiers" which can match a range of possible characters. This
*     allows you to search for keywords that contain (for example)
*     numbers, where the digits comprising the number are not known in
*     advance.
*
*     A field specifier starts with a "%" character. This is followed
*     by an optional single digit (0 to 9) specifying a field
*     width. Finally, there is a single character which specifies the

*     type of character to be matched, as follows:
*
*     - "c": matches all upper case letters,
*     - "d": matches all decimal digits,
*     - "f": matches all characters which are permitted within a FITS
*     keyword (upper case letters, digits, underscores and hyphens).
*
*     If the field width is omitted, the field specifier matches one
*     or more characters. If the field width is zero, it matches zero
*     or more characters. Otherwise, it matches exactly the number of

*     characters specified. In addition to this:
*
*     - The template "%f" will match a blank FITS keyword consisting
*     of 8 spaces (as well as matching all other keywords).
*     - A template consisting of 8 spaces will match a blank keyword
*     (only).
*

*     For example:
*
*     - The template "BitPix" will match the keyword "BITPIX" only.
*     - The template "crpix%1d" will match keywords consisting of
*     "CRPIX" followed by one decimal digit.
*     - The template "P%c" will match any keyword starting with "P"
*     and followed by one or more letters.
*     - The template "E%0f" will match any keyword beginning with "E".
*     - The template "%f" will match any keyword at all (including a
*     blank one).

*  Description:
*     This function applies the supplied Mapping to a set of points along
*     a straight line in the input space. It checks to see if the transformed
*     positions also lie on a straight line (in the output space). If so,

*
*     The returned vector is found by doing a least squares fit.

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        A pointer to the Mapping to test. The number of outputs must be
*        greater than or equal to the number of inputs.
*     g
*        A pointer to an array holding a unit vector within the input space
*        defining the straight line to be checked. The number of elements
*        within this array should equal the number of inputs for "map".
*     g0
*        A pointer to an array holding a position within the input space
*        giving the central position of the vector "g". The number of elements
*        within this array should equal the number of inputs for "map".
*     w0
*        A pointer to an array holding a vector within the output space
*        which corresponds to "g0". The number of elements within this array
*        should equal the number of outputs for "map".
*     dim
*        The length of the pixel axis, or AST__BAD if unknown.
*     tol
*        Pointer to an array holding the tolerance for equality on each
*        output axis.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to dynamically allocated memory holding the required vector
*     in the output space. The number of elements in this vector will equal
*     the number of outputs for "map". The memory should be freed using
*     astFree when no longer needed. If the Mapping is not linear, NULL
*     is returned.

*  Notes:
*     -  NULL is returned if an error occurs.

c     - L  - "int *".
c     - S  - "char **" (a pointer to a static "char" array is returned at the

*        containing the FITS keyword name. This may be a complete FITS
*        header card, in which case the keyword to use is extracted from
*        it. No more than 80 characters are read from this string. If
c        NULL
f        a single dot '.'
*        is supplied, the value of the current card is returned.
c     value
f     VALUE = <X>type (Returned)
c        A pointer to a
f        A
*        buffer to receive the keyword value. The data type depends on <X>
*        as described above. The conents of the buffer on entry are left
*        unchanged if the keyword is not found.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astGetFits<X><X>()
f     AST_GETFITS<X> = LOGICAL
c        A value of zero
f        .FALSE.
*        is returned if the keyword was not found in the FitsChan (no error
*        is reported). Otherwise, a value of
c        one
f        .TRUE.
*        is returned.

*  Notes:
*     -  If a name is supplied, the card following the current card is
*     checked first. If this is not the required card, then the rest of the
*     FitsChan is searched, starting with the first card added to the
*     FitsChan. Therefore cards should be accessed in the order they are
*     stored in the FitsChan (if possible) as this will minimise the time
*     spent searching for cards.
*     -  If the requested card is found, it becomes the current card,
*     otherwise the current card is left pointing at the "end-of-file".
*     -  If the stored keyword value is not of the requested type, it is
*     converted into the requested type.
*     -  If the keyword is found in the FitsChan, but has no associated
*     value, an error is reported. If necessary, the
c     astTestFits
f     AST_TESTFITS
*     function can be used to determine if the keyword has a defined
*     value in the FitsChan prior to calling this function.
*     -  An error will be reported if the keyword name does not conform
*     to FITS requirements.
c     -  Zero
*     -  .FALSE.
*     is returned as the function value if an error has already occurred,
*     or if this function should fail for any reason.
*     - The FITS standard says that string keyword values should be
*     padded with trailing spaces if they are shorter than 8 characters.
*     For this reason, trailing spaces are removed from the string
*     returned by
c     astGetFitsS
f     AST_GETFITSS
*     if the original string (including any trailing spaces) contains 8
*     or fewer characters. Trailing spaces are not removed from longer
*     strings.

*  Description:
*     This function gets the comment associated with the next occurrence of
*     a named keyword in a FitsChan.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     name
*        A pointer to a
*        string holding the keyword name. This may be a complete FITS
*        header card, in which case the keyword to use is extracted from
*        it. No more than 80 characters are read from this string.
*     comment
*        A pointer to a location at which to return a pointer to a string
*        holding the keyword comment. Note, the stored string will change on
*        subsequent invocations of astFitsGetCom so a permanent copy
*        should be taken of the string if necessary.

*  Returned Value:
*     astFitsGetCom()
*        A value of zero is returned if the keyword was not found before
*        the end of the FitsChan was reached (no error is reported).
*        Otherwise, a value of one is returned.

*  Notes:
*     -  If a NULL pointer is supplied for "name" then the comment from
*     the current card is returned.
*     -  The returned value is obtained from the next card refering to
*     the required keyword, starting the search with the current card.
*     Any cards occuring before the current card are not seached. If
*     the entire contents of the FitsChan must be searched, then ensure
*     the current card is the first card in the FitsChan by clearing the Card
*     attribute. This effectively "rewinds" the FitsChan.
*     -  The current card is updated to become the card following the one
*     read by this function. If the card read by this function is the
*     last one in the FitsChan, then the current card is left pointing at the
*     "end-of-file".
*     -  An error will be reported if the keyword name does not conform
*     to FITS requirements.
*     -  A NULL pointer is returned for the comment string if the keyword
*     has no comment.
*     -  Zero is returned as the function value if an error has already
*     occurred, or if this function should fail for any reason.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     name
*        A pointer to a string holding the keyword name.
*     value
*        A pointer to a buffer holding the keyword value. For strings,

f     CALL AST_SETFITS<X>( THIS, NAME, VALUE, COMMENT, OVERWRITE, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan method.

*  Description:
c     This is a family of functions which store values for named keywords
f     This is a family of routines which store values for named keywords
*     within a FitsChan at the current card position. The supplied keyword
*     value can either over-write an existing keyword value, or can be
*     inserted as a new header card into the FitsChan.
*
c     The keyword data type is selected by replacing <X> in the function name
f     The keyword data type is selected by replacing <X> in the routine name
*     by one of the following strings representing the recognised FITS data

*     types:
*
*     - CF - Complex floating point values.
*     - CI - Complex integer values.
*     - F  - Floating point values.
*     - I  - Integer values.
*     - L  - Logical (i.e. boolean) values.
*     - S  - String values.
*     - CN - A "CONTINUE" value, these are treated like string values, but
*            are encoded without an equals sign.
*

*     The data type of the "value" parameter depends on <X> as follows:
*
c     - CF - "double *" (a pointer to a 2 element array holding the real and
c            imaginary parts of the complex value).
c     - CI - "int *" (a pointer to a 2 element array holding the real and
c            imaginary parts of the complex value).
c     - F  - "double".
c     - I  - "int".
c     - L  - "int".
c     - S  - "const char *".
c     - CN - "const char *".
*
f     - CF - DOUBLE PRECISION(2) (a 2 element array holding the real and
f            imaginary parts of the complex value).
f     - CI - INTEGER(2) (a 2 element array holding the real and imaginary
f            parts of the complex value).
f     - F  - DOUBLE PRECISION.
f     - I  - INTEGER
f     - L  - LOGICAL
f     - S  - CHARACTER
f     - CN - CHARACTER

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
c     name
f     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated character string
f        A character string
*        containing the FITS keyword name. This may be a complete FITS
*        header card, in which case the keyword to use is extracted from
*        it. No more than 80 characters are read from this string.
c     value
f     VALUE = <X>type (Given)

*     astGetNextData method inherited from the Channel class).

*  Description:
*     This function reads the next item of input data from a data
*     source associated with a FitsChan and returns the result.  It
*     decodes the data item and returns name/value pairs ready for
*     use.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     skip
*        A non-zero value indicates that a new Object is to be read,
*        and that all input data up to the next "Begin" item are to be
*        skipped in order to locate it. This is useful if the data
*        source contains AST objects interspersed with other data (but
*        note that these other data cannot appear inside AST Objects,
*        only between them).
*
*        A zero value indicates that all input data are significant
*        and the next item will therefore be read and an attempt made
*        to interpret it whatever it contains. Any other data
*        inter-mixed with AST Objects will then result in an error.
*     name
*        An address at which to store a pointer to a null-terminated
*        dynamically allocated string containing the name of the next
*        item in the input data stream. This name will be in lower
*        case with no surrounding white space.  It is the callers
*        responsibilty to free the memory holding this string (using
*        astFree) when it is no longer required.
*
*        A NULL pointer value will be returned (without error) to
*        indicate when there are no further input data items to be
*        read.
*     val
*        An address at which to store a pointer to a null-terminated
*        dynamically allocated string containing the value associated
*        with the next item in the input data stream. No case
*        conversion is performed on this string and all white space is
*        potentially significant.  It is the callers responsibilty to
*        free the memory holding this string (using astFree) when it
*        is no longer required.
*
*        The returned pointer will be NULL if an Object data item is
*        read (see the "Data Representation" section).

*  Data Representation:

*     The returned data items fall into the following categories:
*
*     - Begin: Identified by the name string "begin", this indicates
*     the start of an Object definition. The associated value string
*     gives the class name of the Object being defined.
*
*     - IsA: Identified by the name string "isa", this indicates the
*     end of the data associated with a particular class structure
*     within the definiton of a larger Object. The associated value
*     string gives the name of the class whose data have just been
*     read.
*
*     - End: Identified by the name string "end", this indicates the
*     end of the data associated with a complete Object
*     definition. The associated value string gives the class name of
*     the Object whose definition is being ended.
*
*     - Non-Object: Identified by any other name string plus a
*     non-NULL "val" pointer, this gives the value of a non-Object
*     structure component (instance variable). The name identifies
*     which instance variable it is (within the context of the class
*     whose data are being read) and the value is encoded as a string.
*
*     - Object: Identified by any other name string plus a NULL "val"
*     pointer, this identifies the value of an Object structure
*     component (instance variable).  The name identifies which
*     instance variable it is (within the context of the class whose
*     data are being read) and the value is given by subsequent data
*     items (so the next item should be a "Begin" item).

*  Notes:
*     - NULL pointer values will be returned if this function is
*     invoked with the global error status set, or if it should fail
*     for any reason.

/*
*  Name:

*  Purpose:
*     Store WCS keywords in a FitsChan using FITS-IRAF encoding.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:

*     int IRAFFromStore( AstFitsChan *this, FitsStore *store,
*                        const char *method, const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function copies the WCS information stored in the supplied
*     FitsStore into the supplied FitsChan, using FITS-IRAF encoding.
*
*     IRAF encoding is like FITS-WCS encoding but with the following
*     restrictions:
*
*     1) The celestial projection must not have any projection parameters
*     which are not set to their default values. The one exception to this
*     is that SIN projections are acceptable if the associated projection
*     parameter PV<axlat>_1 is zero and PV<axlat>_2 = cot( reference point
*     latitude). This is encoded using the string "-NCP". The SFL projection
*     is encoded using the string "-GLS". Note, the original IRAF WCS
*     system only recognised a small subset of the currently available
*     projections, but some more recent IRAF-like software recognizes some
*     of the new projections included in the FITS-WCS encoding.
*
*     2) The celestial axes must be RA/DEC, galactic or ecliptic.
*
*     3) LONPOLE and LATPOLE cannot be used.
*
*     4) Only primary axis descriptions are written out.
*
*     5) RADECSYS is used in place of RADESYS.
*
*     6) PC/CDELT keywords are not allowed (CD must be used)

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A value of 1 is returned if succesfull, and zero is returned
*     otherwise.

/*
*  Name:
*     IsMapLinear

*  Purpose:
*     See if a specified Mapping output is linearly related to the
*     Mapping inputs.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     int IsMapLinear( AstMapping *smap, const double lbnd_in[],
*                      const double ubnd_in[], int coord_out, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     Returns a flag indicating if the specified output of the supplied
*     Mapping is a linear function of the Mapping inputs. A set of output
*     positions are created which are evenly spaced along the specified
*     output coordinate. The spacing is chosen so that the entire range
*     of the output coordinate is covered in 20 steps. The other output
*     coordinates are held fixed at arbitrary values (actually, values
*     at which the specified output coordinate achieves its minimum value).
*     This set of output positions is transformed into the corresponding
*     set of input coordinates using the inverse of the supplied Mapping.
*     A least squares linear fit is then made which models each input
*     coordinate as a linear function of the specified output coordinate.
*     The residual at every point in this fit must be less than some
*     small fraction of the total range of the corresponding input
*     coordinate for the Mapping to be considered linear.

*  Parameters:
*     smap
*        Pointer to the Mapping.
*     lbnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of double, with one element for each
*        Mapping input coordinate. This should contain the lower bound
*        of the input box in each input dimension.
*     ubnd_in
*        Pointer to an array of double, with one element for each
*        Mapping input coordinate. This should contain the upper bound
*        of the input box in each input dimension.
*     coord_out
*        The zero-based index of the Mapping output which is to be checked.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     Non-zero if the specified Mapping output is linear. Zero otherwise.

*  Purpose:

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     A specified axis of the supplied Mapping is tested to see if it
*     can be represented by the -TAB alogirithm described in FITS-WCS
*     paper III. If the test is passed, a Mapping is returned from the
*     specified WCS axis to the corresponding psi axis. A FitsTable is
*     also created holding the information to be stored in the
*     corresponding FITS binary table.
*
*     Note, when creating a -TAB header, AST uses grid coords for the psi
*     axis. See FITS-WCS paper III section 6.1.2 for a definition of the
*     psi axes.

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        Pointer to the Mapping from pixel coords to WCS coords.
*     scale
*        A scale factor by which to multiply the axis values stored in the
*        returned FitsTable. Note, the returned Mapping is unaffected by
*        this scaling factor.
*     unit
*        Pointer to the unit string to store with the coords column. If
*        NULL, the unit string is extracted form the supplied WCS Frame.
*     wcsfrm
*        Pointer to a Frame describing WCS coords.
*     dim
*        An array holding the array dimensions in pixels. AST__BAD should
*        be supplied for any unknown dimensions.
*     iax
*        The zero-based index of the Mapping output which is to be checked.
*     iwcs
*        The zero-based index of the corresponding FITS WCS axis.
*     table
*        Pointer to a location holding a pointer to the FitsTable describing
*        the -TAB look-up table. If "*table" is NULL on entry, a new
*        FitsTable will be created and returned, otherwise the supplied
*        FitsTable is used.
*     icolmain
*        The one-based index of the column within "*table" that holds the
*        main data array.
*     icolindex
*        The one-based index of the column within "*table" that holds the
*        index vector. Returned equal to -1 if no index is added to the
*        table (i.e. if the index is a unt index).
*     interp
*        The interpolation method (0=linear, other=nearest neighbour).
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     If the specified "map" output can be described using the -TAB
*     algorithm of FITS-WCS paper III, then a 1-input/1-output Mapping
*     from the specified WCS axis to the corresponding psi axis (which is
*     assumed to be equal to grid coords) is returned. NULL is returned
*     otherwise, of if an error occurs.

*     Private function.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     A specified pair of outputs axes of the supplied Mapping are tested
*     to see if they can be represented by the -TAB alogirithm described in
*     FITS-WCS paper III. If the test is passed, a Mapping is returned from
*     the specified WCS axes to the corresponding psi axes. A FitsTable is
*     also created holding the information to be stored in the corresponding
*     FITS binary table. Note, when creating a header, AST assumes a unit
*     transformaton between psi axes and grid axes (psi axes are defined
*     in FITS-WCS paper III section 6.1.2).

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        Pointer to the Mapping from pixel coords to WCS coords.
*     scale
*        A scale factor by which to multiply the axis values stored in the
*        returned FitsTable. Note, the returned Mapping is unaffected by
*        this scaling factor.
*     unit
*        A unit string for the axis values. If supplied, the same
*        string is stored for both axes. If NULL, the unit strings are
*        extracted from the relavent axes of the supplied WCS Frame.
*     wcsfrm
*        Pointer to a Frame describing WCS coords.
*     dim
*        An array holding the array dimensions in pixels. AST__BAD should
*        be supplied for any unknown dimensions.
*     iax1
*        The zero-based index of the first Mapping output which is to be
*        checked.
*     iax2
*        The zero-based index of the second Mapping output which is to be
*        checked.
*     iwcs1
*        The zero-based index of the FITS WCS axis corresponding to "iax1".
*     iwcs2
*        The zero-based index of the FITS WCS axis corresponding to "iax2".
*     table
*        Pointer to a location holding a pointer to the FitsTable describing
*        the -TAB look-up table. If "*table" is NULL on entry, a new
*        FitsTable will be created and returned, otherwise the supplied
*        FitsTable is used.
*     icolmain1
*        The one-based index of the column within "*table" that holds the
*        main coord array for the first Mapping output.
*     icolmain2
*        The one-based index of the column within "*table" that holds the
*        main coord array for the second Mapping output.
*     icolindex1
*        The one-based index of the column within "*table" that holds the
*        index vector for the first Mapping output. Returned equal to -1
*        if no index is added to the table (e.g. because the index is a
*        unit index).
*     icolindex2
*        The one-based index of the column within "*table" that holds the
*        index vector for the second Mapping output. Returned equal to -1
*        if no index is added to the table (e.g. because the index is a
*        unit index).
*     max1
*        The one-based index of the dimension describing the first Mapping
*        output within the main coord array specified by "icolmain1".
*     max2
*        The one-based index of the dimension describing the second Mapping
*        output within the main coord array specified by "icolmain1".
*     interp1
*        The interpolation method (0=linear, other=nearest neighbour) for
*        the first mapping output.
*     interp2
*        The interpolation method (0=linear, other=nearest neighbour) for
*        the second mapping output.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     If the specified "map" outputs can be described using the -TAB
*     algorithm of FITS-WCS paper III, then a 2-input/2-output Mapping
*     from the specified WCS axes to the corresponding psi axes (i.e.
*     grid axes) is returned. NULL is returned otherwise, of if an error
*     occurs.

*     Create a Mapping describing a FITS-WCS logarithmic algorithm

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     This function uses the contents of the supplied FitsStore to create
*     a Mapping which goes from Intermediate World Coordinate (known as "w"
*     in the context of FITS-WCS paper III) to a logarthmic version of w

*     called "S" given by:
*
*     S = Sr.exp( w/Sr )
*
*     where Sr is the value of S corresponding to w=0.

*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore structure holding the values to use for
*        the WCS keywords.
*     i
*        The zero-based index of the axis within the FITS header
*     s
*        A character identifying the co-ordinate version to use. A space
*        means use primary axis descriptions. Otherwise, it must be an
*        upper-case alphabetical characters ('A' to 'Z').

*     inputs and N outputs. The inputs correspond to FITS GRID coords
*     within the array. FITS-WCS paper III requires that the first dimension
*     in the array has a length of "N" and contains the N output values
*     at each input values.

*  Parameters:
*     table
*        Pointer to the Fitstable.
*     col
*        A string holding the name of the column to use.
*     isindex
*        Non-zero if the column hold an index array, zero if it holds a
*        coordinate array.
*     interp
*        The value to use for the Interp attribute of the LutMap. A value
*        of zero tells the LutMap class to use linear interpolation. Other
*        values tell the LutMap class to use nearest neighbour interpolation.

*                                    int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     This function constructs a new FrameSet holding the pixel and WCS
*     Frames from the supplied FrameSet, but optionally extends the WCS
*     Frame to include any extra axes needed to conform to the FITS model.

*     Currently, this function does the following:
*
*     - if the WCS Frame contains a spectral axis with a defined celestial
*     reference position (SpecFrame attributes RefRA and RefDec), then
*     it ensures that the WCS Frame also contains a pair of celestial
*     axes (such axes are added if they do not already exist within the
*     supplied WCS Frame). The pixel->WCS Mapping is adjusted accordingly.
*
*     - if the WCS Frame contains a spectral axis and a pair of celestial
*     axes, then the SpecFrame attributes RefRA and RefDec are set to the
*     reference position defined by the celestial axes. The pixel->WCS
*     Mapping is adjusted accordingly.
*
*     - NULL is returned if the WCS Frame contains more than one spectral
*     axis.
*
*     - NULL is returned if the WCS Frame contains more than one pair of
*     celestial axes.
*
*     - Any isolated sky axes (i.e. not contained within a SkyFrame) are
*     re-mapped from radians into degrees.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The FitsChan.
*     fset
*        The FrameSet to check.
*     ipix
*        The index of the FITS pixel Frame within "fset".
*     iwcs
*        The index of the WCS Frame within "fset".
*     encoding
*        The encoding in use.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A new FrameSet which confoms to the requirements of the FITS-WCS
*     papers. The base Frame in this FrameSet will be the FITS pixel
*     Frame, and the current Frame will be the WCS Frame. NULL is
*     returned if an error has already occurred, or if the FrameSet cannot
*     be produced for any reason.

/*
*  Name:
*     MakeIntWorld

*  Purpose:
*     Create FITS header values which map grid into intermediate world
*     coords.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     int MakeIntWorld( AstMapping *cmap, AstFrame *fr, int *wperm, char s,
*                       FitsStore *store, double *dim,
*                       const char *method, const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     This function adds values to the supplied FitsStore which describe
*     the transformation from grid (pixel) coords to intermediate world
*     coords. The values added to the FitsStore correspond to the CRPIXj,
*     PCi_j, CDELTi and WCSAXES keywords, and are determined by examining the
*     suppliedMapping, which must be linear with an optional shift of
*     origin (otherwise a value of zero is returned).
*
*     Much of the complication in the algorithm arises from the need to
*     support cases where the supplied Mapping has more outputs than
*     inputs. In these case we add some "degenerate" axes to the grid
*     coord system, choosing their unit vectors to be orthogonal to all
*     the other grid axes. It is assumed that degenerate axes will never
*     be used to find a position other than at the axis value of 1.0.
*
*     NOTE, appropriate values for CRVAL keywords should have been stored
*     in the FitsStore before calling this function (since this function may
*     modify them).

*  Parameters:
*     cmap
*        A pointer to a Mapping which transforms grid coordinates into
*        intermediate world coordinates. The number of outputs must be
*        greater than or equal to the number of inputs.
*     fr
*        Pointer to the final WCS coordinate Frame.
*     wperm
*        Pointer to an array of integers with one element for each axis of
*        the "fr" Frame. Each element holds the zero-based index of the
*        FITS-WCS axis (i.e. the value of "i" in the keyword names "CTYPEi",
*        "CDi_j", etc) which describes the Frame axis.
*     s
*        The co-ordinate version character. A space means the primary
*        axis descriptions. Otherwise the supplied character should be
*        an upper case alphabetical character ('A' to 'Z').
*     store
*        A pointer to the FitsStore into which the calculated CRPIX and
*        CDi_j values are to be put.
*     dim
*        An array holding the image dimensions in pixels. AST__BAD can be
*        supplied for any unknwon dimensions.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A value of 1 is returned if the CRPIX and CDi_j values are
*     succesfully calculated. Zero is returned otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  Zero is returned if an error occurs.

*        An integer flag indicating what the function should do:
*
*        AST__LOCK: Lock the Object for exclusive use by the calling

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     All characters in the template other than "%" (and the field width
*     and type specifiers which follow a "%") must be matched by an
*     identical character (ignoring case) in the test string. If a "%" occurs
*     in the template, then the next character in the template should be a
*     single digit specifying a field width. If it is zero, then the test
*     string may contain zero or more matching characters. Otherwise,
*     the test string must contain exactly the specified number of matching
*     characters (i.e. 1 to 9). The field width digit may be omitted, in
*     which case the test string must contain one or more matching
*     characters. The next character in the template specifies the type of
*     matching characters and must be one of "d", "c" or "f". Decimal digits
*     are matched by "d", all upper (but not lower) case alphabetical
*     characters are matched by "c", and all characters which are legal within
*     a FITS keyword (i.e. upper case letters, digits, underscores and
*     hyphens) are matched by "f".

*  Parameters:
*     test
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the keyword name to
*        be tested.
*     temp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the template.
*     maxfld
*        The maximum number of integer field values which should be
*        returned in "fields".
*     fields
*        A pointer to an array of at least "maxfld" integers. This is
*        returned holding the values of any integer fields specified
*        in the template. The values are extracted from the test string,
*        and stored in the order they appear in the template string.
*     nfld
*        Pointer to a location at which is returned the total number of
*        integer fields in the test string. This may be more than the
*        number returned in "fields" if "maxfld" is smaller than "*nfld".
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     Zero is returned if the test string does not match the template
*     string, and one is returned if it does.

/*
*  Name:
*     OrthVector

*  Purpose:
*     Find a unit vector which is orthogonal to a set of supplied vectors.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     double *OrthVector( int n, int m, double **in, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     A set of M vectors is supplied, each vector being N-dimensional.
*     It is assumed that M < N and that the supplied vectors span M
*     axes within the N dimensional space. An N-dimensional unit vector is
*     returned which is orthogonal to all the supplied vectors.
*
*     The required vector is orthogonal to all the supplied vectors.
*     Therefore the dot product of the required vector with each of the
*     supplied vectors must be zero. This gives us M equations of the

*     form:
*
*     a1*r1 + a2*r2 + a3*r3 + .... + aN*rN = 0.0
*     b1*r1 + b2*r2 + b3*r3 + .... + bN*rN = 0.0
*     ...
*
*     where (a1,a2,..,aN), (b1,b2,..,bN), ... are the supplied vectors
*     and (r1,r2,...,rN) is the required vector. Since M is less
*     than N the system of linear simultaneous equations is under
*     specified and we need to assign arbitrary values to some of the
*     components of the required vector in order to allow the equations
*     to be solved. We arbitrarily assume that 1 element of the required
*     vector has value 1.0 and (N-M-1) have value zero. The selection of
*     *which* elements to set constant is based on the magnitudes of the
*     columns of coefficients (a1,b1...), (a2,b2,...), etc. The M components
*     of the required vector which are *not* set constant are the ones which
*     have coefficient columns with the *largest* magnitude. This choice is
*     made in order to minimise the risk of the remaining matrix of
*     coefficients being singular (for instance, if a component of the
*     required vector has a coefficient of zero in every supplied vector
*     then the column magnitude will be zero and that component will be
*     set to 1.0). After choosing the M largest columns, the largest
*     remaining column is assigned a value of 1.0 in the required vector,
*     and all other columns are assigned the value zero in the required

*     vector. This means that the above equations becomes:
*
*     a1*r1 + a2*r2 + a3*r3 + .... + aM*rM = -aM+1
*     b1*r1 + b2*r2 + b3*r3 + .... + bM*rM = -bM+1
*     ...
*
*     Where the indices are now not direct indices into the supplied and
*     returned vectors, but indices into an array of indices which have
*     been sorted into column magnitude order. This is now a set of MxM

*     simultaneous linear equations which we can solve using palDmat:
*
*     MAT.R = V
*
*     where MAT is the the matrix of columns (coefficients) on the left
*     hand side of the above set of simultaneous equations, R is the
*     required vector (just the components which have *not* been set
*     constant), and V is a constant vector equal to the column of values
*     on the right hand side in the above set of simultaneous equations.
*     The palDmat function solves this equation to obtain R.

*  Parameters:
*     n
*        The number of dimensions
*     m
*        The number of supplied vectors.
*     in
*        A pointer to an array with "m" elements, each element being a
*        pointer to an array with "n" elements. Each of these "n" element
*        array holds one of the supplied vectors.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     The pointer to some newly allocated memory holding the returned N
*     dimensional unit vector. The memory should be freed using astFree when
*     no longer needed.

*  Notes:
*     -  NULL is returned if an error occurs.
*     -  NULL is returned (without error) if the required vector cannot
*     be found (.e.g becuase the supplied M vectors span less than M axes).

/*
*  Name:
*     OtherAxes

*  Purpose:
*     Add values to a FitsStore describing unknown axes in a Frame.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"

*     AstMapping *OtherAxes( AstFitsChan *this, AstFrameSet *fs, double *dim,
*                            int *wperm, char s, FitsStore *store,
*                            double *crvals, int *axis_done,
*                            const char *method, const char *class,
*                            int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     FITS WCS keyword values are added to the supplied FitsStore which
*     describe any as yet undescribed axes in the supplied FrameSet. These
*     axes are assumed to be linear and to follow the conventions
*     of FITS-WCS paper I (if in fact they are not linear, then the
*     grid->iwc mapping determined by MakeIntWorld will not be linear and
*     so the axes will be rejected).
*
*     Note, this function does not store values for keywords which define
*     the transformation from pixel coords to Intermediate World Coords
*     (CRPIX, PC and CDELT), but a Mapping is returned which embodies these
*     values. This Mapping is from the current Frame in the FrameSet (WCS
*     coords) to a Frame representing IWC. The IWC Frame has the same number
*     of axes as the WCS Frame which may be greater than the number of base
*     Frame (i.e. pixel) axes.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     fs
*        Pointer to the FrameSet. The base Frame should represent FITS pixel
*        coordinates, and the current Frame should represent FITS WCS
*        coordinates. The number of base Frame axes should not exceed the
*        number of current Frame axes.
*     dim
*        An array holding the image dimensions in pixels. AST__BAD can be
*        supplied for any unknwon dimensions.
*     wperm
*        Pointer to an array of integers with one element for each axis of
*        the current Frame. Each element holds the zero-based
*        index of the FITS-WCS axis (i.e. the value of "i" in the keyword
*        names "CTYPEi", "CRVALi", etc) which describes the Frame axis.
*     s
*        The co-ordinate version character. A space means the primary
*        axis descriptions. Otherwise the supplied character should be
*        an upper case alphabetical character ('A' to 'Z').
*     store
*        The FitsStore in which to store the FITS WCS keyword values.
*     crvals
*        Pointer to an array holding the default CRVAL value for each
*        axis in the WCS Frame.
*     axis_done
*        An array of flags, one for each Frame axis, which indicate if a
*        description of the corresponding axis has yet been stored in the
*        FitsStore.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     If any axis descriptions were added to the FitsStore, a Mapping from
*     the current Frame of the supplied FrameSet, to the IWC Frame is returned.
*     Otherwise, a UnitMap is returned. Note, the Mapping only defines the IWC
*     transformation for the described axes. Any other (previously
*     described) axes are passed unchanged by the returned Mapping.

*  Name:

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function copies the WCS information stored in the supplied
*     FitsStore into the supplied FitsChan, using FITS-PC encoding.
*
*     Zero is returned if the primary axis descriptions cannot be produced.
*     Whether or not secondary axis descriptions can be produced does not
*     effect the returned value (i.e. failure to produce a specific set of
*     secondary axes does not prevent other axis descriptions from being
*     produced).

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A value of 1 is returned if succesfull, and zero is returned
*     otherwise.

*  Name:
*     PreQuote

*  Purpose:

*  Synopsis:

*     void PreQuote( const char *value,
*                    char string[ AST__FITSCHAN_FITSCARDLEN - FITSNAMLEN - 3 ] )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     This function processes a string value in such a way that it can
*     be stored as a FITS character value (associated with a keyword)
*     and later retrieved unchanged, except for possible truncation.
*
*     This pre-processing is necessary because FITS does not regard
*     trailing white space as significant, so it is lost. This
*     function adds double quote (") characters around the string if
*     it is necessary in order to prevent this loss. These quotes are
*     also added to zero-length strings and to strings that are
*     already quoted (so that the original quotes are not lost when
*     they are later un-quoted).
*
*     This function will silently truncate any string that is too long
*     to be stored as a FITS character value, but will ensure that the
*     maximum number of characters are retained, taking account of any
*     quoting required.

*  Parameters:
*     value
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        input character data to be quoted. All white space is
*        significant.
*     string
*        A character array into which the result string will be
*        written, with a terminating null. The maximum number of
*        characters from the input string that can be accommodated in
*        this is (AST__FITSCHAN_FITSCARDLEN - FITSNAMLEN - 4), but this
*        will be reduced if quoting is necessary.

*  Notes:
*     - The UnPreQuote function should be used to reverse the effect
*     of this function on a string (apart from any truncation).

*  Description:
*     This function reads an Object from a FitsChan.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Object. This will always be a FrameSet.

*  Notes:
*     -  The pixel Frame is given a title of "Pixel Coordinates", and
*     each axis in the pixel Frame is given a label of the form "Pixel
*     axis <n>", where <n> is the axis index (starting at one).
*     -  The FITS CTYPE keyword values are used to set the labels for any
*     non-celestial axes in the physical coordinate Frames, and the FITS
*     CUNIT keywords are used to set the corresponding units strings.
*     -  On exit, the pixel Frame is the base Frame, and the physical
*     Frame derived from the primary axis descriptions is the current Frame.
*     -  Extra Frames are added to hold any secondary axis descriptions. All
*     axes within such a Frame refer to the same coordinate version ('A',
*     'B', etc).
*     -  For foreign encodings, the first card in the FitsChan must be
*     the current card on entry (otherwise a NULL pointer is returned),
*     and the FitsChan is left at end-of-file on exit.
*     -  For the Native encoding, reading commences from the current card
*     on entry (which need not be the first in the FitsChan), and the
*     current Card on exit is the first card following the last one read
*     (or end-of-file).

*  Description:

*     and is stored in the FitsChan using astPutFits.
*
*     If no source function was provided, the FitsChan is left as supplied.
*     This is different to a standard Channel, which tries to read data
*     from standard input if no source function is provided.
*
*     This function should be called at the start of most public or protected
*     FitsChan functions, and most private functions that are used to override
*     methods inherited form the Channel class. Previously, this function
*     was called only once, from the FitsChan initialiser (astInitFitschan).
*     However, calling it from astInitFitsChan means that application code
*     cannot use the astPutChannelData function with a FitsChan, since the
*     source function would already have been called by the time the
*     FitsChan constructor returned (and thus before astPutChannelData
*     could have been called). In order to ensure that the source
*     function is called only once, this function now nullifies the source
*     function pointer after its first use.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Notes:
*     -  The new cards are appended to the end of the FitsChan.

*  Description:
c     This function
f     This routine

*     the card should not be removed from the FitsChan when an Object is
*     read from the FitsChan using
c     astRead.
f     AST_READ.
*
*     Cards that have not been flagged in this way are removed when a
*     read operation completes succesfully, but only if the card was used
*     in the process of creating the returned AST Object. Any cards that
*     are irrelevant to the creation of the AST Object are retained whether
*     or not they are flagged.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - This function returns without action if the FitsChan is
*     initially positioned at the "end-of-file" (i.e. if the Card
*     attribute exceeds the number of cards in the FitsChan).
*     - The current card is not changed by this function.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     The supplied keyword string value is stored in the specified array,
*     at a position indicated by the axis and co-ordinate version.
*     The array is created or extended as necessary to make room for
*     the new value. Any old value is over-written.

*  Parameters:
*     item
*        The address of the pointer within the FitsStore which locates the
*        arrays of values for the required keyword (eg &(store->ctype) ).
*        The array located by the supplied pointer contains a vector of
*        pointers. Each of these pointers is associated with a particular
*        co-ordinate version (s), and locates an array of pointers for that
*        co-ordinate version. Each such array of pointers has an element
*        for each intermediate axis number (i), and the pointer locates an
*        array of axis keyword string pointers. These arrays of keyword
*        string pointers have one element for every pixel axis (j) or
*        projection parameter (m).
*     i
*        The zero based intermediate axis index in the range 0 to 98. Set
*        this to zero for keywords (e.g. RADESYS) which are not indexed by
*        intermediate axis number.
*     jm
*        The zero based pixel axis index (in the range 0 to 98) or parameter
*        index (in the range 0 to WCSLIB__MXPAR-1). Set this to zero for
*        keywords (e.g. CTYPE) which are not indexed by either pixel axis or
*        parameter number.
*     val
*        The keyword string value to store. A copy of the supplied string
*        is taken.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*   Notes:

*     void Shpc1( double xmin, double xmax, int n, double *d, double *w,

*  Description:
*     Given the coefficients of a one-dimensional polynomial P(u) defined on a
*     unit interval (i.e. -1 <= u <= +1 ), find the coefficients of another
*     one-dimensional polynomial Q(x) where:
*
*       Q(x) = P(u)
*       u = ( 2*x - ( xmax + xmin ) ) / ( xmax - xmin )
*
*     That is, u is a scaled version of x, such that the unit interval in u
*     maps onto (xmin:xmax) in x.

*  Parameters:
*     xmin
*        X value corresponding to u = -1
*     xmax
*        X value corresponding to u = +1
*     n
*        One more than the maximum power of u within P.
*     d
*        An array of n elements supplied holding the coefficients of P such
*        that the coefficient of (u^i) is held in element (i).
*     w
*        An array of n elements returned holding the coefficients of Q such
*        that the coefficient of (x^i) is held in element (i).
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Notes:
*    - Vaguely inspired by the Numerical Recipes routine "pcshft". But the
*    original had bugs, so I wrote this new version from first principles.

   2) In "a*R*x", the effect of multiplying by "x" is to move the existing
   coefficients in "w" up one element. We then multiply the shifted
   coefficients by "a" and add them onto the coefficients produced at
   step 1) above.

   We know that "w" still contains the initial zeros at indices higher than
   "i" so we only need to scale the bottom "i" elements. We do not do the
   zeroth term in this loop since there is no lower term to shift up into
   it. */

*  Description:
*     This function calculates values for the LONPOLE and LATPOLE FITS
*     keywords and stores them in the supplied FitsStore. LONPOLE and
*     LATPOLE are the longitude and latitude of the celestial north pole
*     in native spherical coordinates.

*  Parameters:
*     map2
*        Pointer to the Mapping from Intermediate World Coordinates to Native
*        Spherical Coordinates.
*     map3
*        Pointer to the Mapping from Native Spherical Coordinates to celestial
*        coordinates.
*     ilon
*        Zero-based index of longitude output from "map3".
*     ilat
*        Zero-based index of latitude output from "map3".
*     wperm
*        Pointer to an array of integers with one element for each axis of
*        the current Frame. Each element holds the zero-based
*        index of the FITS-WCS axis (i.e. the value of "i" in the keyword
*        names "CTYPEi", "CRVALi", etc) which describes the Frame axis.
*     s
*        The co-ordinate version character. A space means the primary
*        axis descriptions. Otherwise the supplied character should be
*        an upper case alphabetical character ('A' to 'Z').
*     store
*        The FitsStore in which to store the FITS WCS keyword values.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     The current Frame of the supplied FrameSet is searched for spectral
*     axes. If any are found, FITS WCS keyword values describing the axis
*     are added to the supplied FitsStore, if possible (the conventions
*     of FITS-WCS paper III are used). Note, this function does not store
*     values for keywords which define the transformation from pixel
*     coords to Intermediate World Coords (CRPIX, PC and CDELT), but a
*     Mapping is returned which embodies these values. This Mapping is
*     from the current Frame in the FrameSet (WCS coords) to a Frame
*     representing IWC. The IWC Frame has the same number of axes as the
*     WCS Frame which may be greater than the number of base Frame (i.e.
*     pixel) axes.
*
*     If a spectral axis is found, the RafRA and RefDec attributes of the
*     SpecFrame describing the axis are ignored: it is assumed that the
*     WCS Frame also contains a pair of celestial axes which will result
*     in appropriate celestial reference values being stored in the
*     FitsStore (this asumption should be enforced by calling function
*     MakeFitsFrameSet prior to calling this function).

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     fs
*        Pointer to the FrameSet. The base Frame should represent FITS pixel
*        coordinates, and the current Frame should represent FITS WCS
*        coordinates. The number of base Frame axes should not exceed the
*        number of current Frame axes. The spectral Unit in the returned
*        FrameSet will always be linearly related to the default Units for
*        the spectral System in use by the axis. If this requires a
*        change to the existing spectral Unit, the integrity of the
*        FrameSet will be maintained by suitable adjustments to the Mappings
*        within the FrameSet.
*     dim
*        An array holding the image dimensions in pixels. AST__BAD can be
*        supplied for any unknwon dimensions.
*     wperm
*        Pointer to an array of integers with one element for each axis of
*        the current Frame. Each element holds the zero-based
*        index of the FITS-WCS axis (i.e. one les than the value of "i" in
*        the keyword names "CTYPEi", "CRVALi", etc) which describes the
*        Frame axis.
*     s
*        The co-ordinate version character. A space means the primary
*        axis descriptions. Otherwise the supplied character should be
*        an upper case alphabetical character ('A' to 'Z').
*     store
*        The FitsStore in which to store the FITS WCS keyword values.
*     crvals
*        Pointer to an array holding the default CRVAL value for each
*        axis in the WCS Frame.
*     axis_done
*        An array of flags, one for each Frame axis, which indicate if a
*        description of the corresponding axis has yet been stored in the
*        FitsStore.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     If a spectral axis was found which can be described using the
*     conventions of FITS-WCS paper III, then a Mapping from the current Frame
*     of the supplied FrameSet, to the IWC Frame is returned. Otherwise,
*     a UnitMap is returned. Note, the Mapping only defines the IWC
*     transformation for spectral axes. Any non-spectral axes are passed
*     unchanged by the returned Mapping.

/*
*  Name:
*     SpecTrans

*  Purpose:
*     Translated non-standard WCS FITS headers into equivalent standard
*     ones.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     AstFitsChan *SpecTrans( AstFitsChan *this, int encoding,
*                             const char *method, const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     This function checks the supplied FitsChan for selected
*     non-standard WCS keywords and, if found, stores equivalent
*     standard keywords in a newly created FitsChan which is returned as
*     the function value. All the original keywords are marked
*     as having been used, so that they are not written out when the
*     FitsChan is deleted.
*

*     At the moment, the non-standard keywords checked for are:
*
*     1) RADECSYS is renamed as RADESYS
*
*     2) LONGPOLE is renamed as LONPOLE
*
*     3) CDjjjiii and CDj_i are converted to PCi_j (with unit CDELT)
*
*     4) CROTAj are converted to PCi_j
*
*     5) PROJPi are converted to PV<axlat>_i
*
*     6) CmVALi are converted to CRVALis (s=A,B,,, for m=1,2...). This
*        is also done for CmPIXi, CmYPEi, and CmNITi. CmELTi is converted
*        to a CDj_is array.
*
*     7) EQUINOX keywords with string values equal to a date preceded
*        by the letter B or J (eg "B1995.0"). These are converted to the
*        corresponding Julian floating point value without any epoch
*        specifier.
*
*     8) EPOCH values are converted into Julian EQUINOX values (but only
*        if the FitsChan does not already contain an EQUINOX value).
*
*     9) DATE-OBS values are converted into MJD-OBS values (but only
*        if the FitsChan does not already contain an MJD-OBS value).
*
*     10) EQUINOX or EPOCH keywords with value zero  are converted to
*         B1950.
*
*     11) The AIPS NCP and GLS projections are converted into equivalent SIN
*         or SFL projections.
*
*     12) The IRAF "ZPX" projection. If the last 4 chacaters of CTYPEi

*       (i = 1, naxis) are "-ZPX", then:
*	- "ZPX" is replaced by "ZPN" within the CTYPEi value
*	- A distortion code of "-ZPX" is appended to the end of the CTYPEi
*       value (this is used later by the DistortMaps function).
*       - If the FitsChan contains no PROJP keywords, then projection
*       parameter valus are read from any WATi_nnn keywords, and
*       corresponding PV keywords are added to the FitsChan.
*
*     13) The IRAF "TNX" projection. If the last 4 chacaters of CTYPEi

*       (i = 1, naxis) are "-TNX", then:
*	- "TNX" is replaced by "TAN" within the CTYPEi value (the distorted
*       TAN projection included in a pre-final version of FITS-WCS is still
*       supported by AST using the WcsMap AST__TPN projection).
*       - If the FitsChan contains no PROJP keywords, then projection
*       parameter valus are read from any WATi_nnn keywords, and
*       corresponding PV keywords are added to the FitsChan.
*       - If the TNX projection cannot be converted exactly into a TAN
*       projection, ASTWARN keywords are added to the FitsChan
*       containing a warning message. The calling application can (if it
*       wants to) check for this keyword, and report its contents to the
*       user.
*
*     14) Keywords relating to the IRAF "mini-WCS" system are removed.
*       This is the IRAF equivalent of the AST native encoding. Mini-WCS
*       keywords are removed in order to avoid confusion arising between
*       potentially inconsistent encodings.
*
*     15) "QV" parameters for TAN projections (as produced by AUTOASTROM)
*       or "-TAB" (as produced by FitsChan) are renamed to "PV".
*
*     16) RESTFREQ is converted to RESTFRQ.
*
*     17) the "-WAV", "-FRQ" and "-VEL" CTYPE algorithms included in an
*       early draft of FITS-WCS paper III are translated to the
*       corresponding modern "-X2P" form.
*
*     18) AIPS spectral CTYPE values are translated to FITS-WCS paper III
*     equivalents.
*
*     19) AIPS spectral keywords OBSRA and OBSDEC are used to create a
*     pair of celestial axes with reference point at the specified
*     (OBSRA,OBSDEC) position. This is only done if the header does not
*     already contain a pair of celestial axes.
*
*     20) Common case insensitive CUNIT values: "Hz", "Angstrom", "km/s",
*     "M/S"
*
*     21) Various translations specific to the FITS-CLASS encoding.
*
*     22) SAO distorted TAN projections (uses COi_j keywords to store
*     polynomial coefficients) are converted to TPN projections.

*     23) CTYPE == "LAMBDA" changed to CTYPE = "WAVE"
*
*     24) if the projection is TAN and the PolyTan attribute is non-zero,
*     or if the projection is TPV (produced by SCAMP), the projection is
*     changed to TPN (the AST code for the draft FITS-WCS paper II
*     conventions for a distorted TAN projection).

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     encoding
*        The FitsChan encoding in use.
*     method
*        Pointer to string holding name of calling method.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new FitsChan containing the keywords which
*     constitute the standard equivalents to any non-standard keywords in
*     the supplied FitsChan. A NULL pointer is returned if there are no
*     non-standard keywords in the supplied FitsChan.

*  Name:
*     Split

*  Purpose:
*     Extract the keyword name, value and comment from a FITS header card.

*  Type:

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     int Split( AstFitsChan *this, const char *card, char **name, char **value,
*                char **comment, const char *method, const char *class, int *status  )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     The name, value and comment (if present) are extracted from the
*     supplied card text and returned.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsCHan.
*     card
*        Pointer to a string holding the FITS header card.
*     name
*        Pointer to a location at which to return the pointer to a string
*        holding the keyword name.
*     value
*        Pointer to a location at which to return the pointer to a string
*        holding the keyword value.
*     comment
*        Pointer to a location at which to return the pointer to a string
*        holding the keyword comment.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned value:
*     -  An integer identifying the data type of the keyword value. This
*     will be one of the values AST__UNDEF, AST__COMMENT, AST__INT,
*     AST__STRING, AST__CONTINUE, AST__FLOAT, AST__COMPLEXI or AST__COMPLEXF
*     defined in fitschan.h.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the keyword value is a string, then the returned value does not
*     include the delimiting quotes, and pairs of adjacent quotes within the
*     string are replaced by single quotes.
*     -  A maximum of 80 characters are read from the supplied card, so the
*     string does not need to be null terminated unless less than 80
*     characters are to be read.
*     -  The memory holding the three strings "name", "value" and "comment"
*     should be released when no longer needed using astFree.
*     -  NULL pointers and a data type of AST__COMMENT are returned if an
*     error has already occurred, or if this function fails for any reason.

/*
*  Name:
*     SplitMap

*  Purpose:
*     Locate a WCS projection within a Mapping.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     int SplitMap( AstMapping *map, int invert, int ilon, int ilat,
*                   AstMapping **map1, AstWcsMap **map2, AstMapping **map3, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     If possible, the supplied Mapping is decomposed into three component
*     mappings to be compounded in series. To be acceptable, the second of
*     these three Mappings must be an inverted WcsMap with a non-zero
*     FITSProj attribute value, and there must not be such a WcsMap in
*     either of the other two Mappings. If it is not possible to produce
*     such a group of three Mappings, then a zero function value is returned,
*     together with three NULL Mapping pointers. All the mappings before the
*     WcsMap are compounded together and returned as "map1". The inverse of
*     the WcsMap itself is returned as "map2", and any remaining Mappings
*     are compounded together and returned as "map3".
*
*     The search algorithm allows for an arbitrary combination of series and
*     parallel CmpMaps.

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        A pointer to the Mapping from pixel to physical coordinates.
*     invert
*        The value of the Invert attribute to use with "map" (the value
*        returned by astGetInvert is not used).
*     ilon
*        Index of mapping output which is connected to the longitude axis.
*     ilat
*        Index of mapping output which is connected to the latitude axis.
*     map1
*        A location at which to return a pointer to the Mapping from pixel
*        to intermediate world coordinates.
*     map2
*        A location at which to return a pointer to the Mapping from
*        intermediate world coordinates to native spherical coordinates. This
*        will be an inverted WcsMap with non-zero FITSProj attribute value.
*     map3
*        A location at which to return a pointer to the Mapping from
*        native spherical coordinates to physical coordinates.
*     dep
*        The address of an integer holding the current depth of recursion
*        into this function.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     One if a suitable WcsMap was found, zero otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  The returned Mappings contain independant copies of the relevant
*     components of the supplied Mapping and can be modified without
*     changing the supplied Mapping.
*     -  NULL pointers will be returned for all Mappings if no WcsMap
*     can be found in the supplied Mapping.
*     -  A pointer to a UnitMap will be returned for map1 if no mappings
*     exist before the WcsMap.
*     -  A pointer to a UnitMap will be returned for map3 if no mappings
*     exist after the WcsMap.
*     -  NULL pointers will be returned for all Mappings and a function
*     value of zero will be returned if an error has occurred, or if this
*     function should fail for any reason.

/*
*  Name:
*     SplitMap2

*  Purpose:
*     Locate a WCS projection within a Mapping.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     int SplitMap2( AstMapping *map, int invert, AstMapping **map1,
*                    AstWcsMap **map2, AstMapping **map3, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     If possible, the supplied Mapping is decomposed into three component
*     mappings to be compounded in series. To be acceptable, the second of
*     these three Mappings must be a WcsMap with a non-zero FITSProj value.
*     If it is not possible to produce such a group of three Mappings, then a
*     zero function value is returned, together with three NULL Mapping
*     pointers. All the mappings before the WcsMap are compounded together
*     and returned as "map1". The WcsMap itself is returned as "map2", and
*     any remaining Mappings are compounded together and returned as "map3".
*
*     The search algorithm allows for an arbitrary combination of series and
*     parallel CmpMaps.

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        A pointer to the Mapping from pixel to physical coordinates.
*     invert
*        The value of the Invert attribute to use with "map" (the value
*        returned by astGetInvert is not used).
*     map1
*        A location at which to return a pointer to the Mapping from pixel
*        to intermediate world coordinates.
*     map2
*        A location at which to return a pointer to the Mapping from relative
*        physical coordinates to native spherical coordinates. This will
*        be a WcsMap, and it will have a non-zero FITSProj value.
*     map3
*        A location at which to return a pointer to the Mapping from
*        native spherical coordinates to physical coordinates.
*     dep
*        The address of an integer holding the current depth of recursion
*        into this function.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     One if a suitable WcsMap was found, zero otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  The returned Mappings contain independant copies of the relevant
*     components of the supplied Mapping and can be modified without
*     changing the supplied Mapping.
*     -  NULL pointers will be returned for all Mappings if no WcsMap
*     with anon-zero FITSProj value can be found in the supplied Mapping.
*     -  A pointer to a UnitMap will be returned for map1 if no mappings
*     exist before the WcsMap.
*     -  A pointer to a UnitMap will be returned for map3 if no mappings
*     exist after the WcsMap.
*     -  NULL pointers will be returned for all Mappings and a function
*     value of zero will be returned if an error has occurred, or if this
*     function should fail for any reason.
*     - "*map1" and "*map3" may contain WcsMaps, but they will have zero
*     values for their FITSProj values.

*  Synopsis:
*     int SplitMat( int naxis, double *matrix, double *cdelt, int *status )

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     This function splits up the supplied CD matrix into separate PC and
*     CDELT matrices. The product of the returned matrices (CDELT.PC)
*     equals the supplied CD matrix. The CDELT values are chosen so that
*     the corresponding row of the PC matrix represents a unit vector.
*     The signs of the CDELT values are chosen so that the diagonal terms
*     of the PC matrix are all positive.
*

*  Parameters:
*     naxis
*        The number of axes.
*     matrix
*        A pointer to an array of naxis*naxis elements. On entry this holds
*        the "CD" matrix. On exit, it is modified to represent the "PC"
*        matrix.
*     cdelt
*        A pointer to an array of naxis elements. On exit this holds the CDELT
*        values for each axis (i.e. the diagonal terms of the CDELT matrix).
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

* Returned Value:
*     Zero is returned if any bad values are found in the supplied
*     matrix, or if an error has already occurred. One is returned otherwise.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
c     This function can be used to register a call-back function
f     This routine can be used to register a call-back routine
*     with a FitsChan. The registered
c     function
f     routine
*     is called when-ever the FitsChan needs to read information from a
*     binary table contained within a FITS file. This occurs if the
c     astRead
f     AST_READ
*     function is invoked to read a FrameSet from a set of FITS headers
*     that use the "-TAB" algorithm to describe one or more axes. Such
*     axes use a FITS binary table to store a look-up table of axis values.
*     The FitsChan will fail to read such axes unless the "TabOK" attribute
*     is set to a non-zero positive integer value. The table containing the
*     axis values must be made available to the FitsChan either by storing
*     the table contents in the FitsChan (using
c     astPutTables or astPutTable) prior to invoking astRead
f     AST_PUTTABLES or AST_PUTTABLE) prior to invoking AST_READ
*     or by registering a call-back
c     function using astTableSource.
f     routine using AST_TABLESOURCE.
*     The first method is possibly simpler, but requires that the name of
*     the extension containing the table be known in advance. Since the
*     table name is embedded in the FITS headers, the name is often not
*     known in advance. If a call-back is registered, the FitsChan will
*     determine the name of the required table and invoke the call-back
c     function
f     routine
*     to supply the table at the point where it is needed (i.e. within
c     the astRead method).
f     the AST_READ method).

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
c     tabsource
f     TABSOURCE = SUBROUTINE (Given)
c        Pointer to the table source function to use.
f        The table source routine to use.
*        It takes five arguments - the first is a pointer to the
*        FitsChan, the second is a string holding the name of the
*        FITS extension containing the required binary table ("EXTNAME"),
*        the third is the integer FITS "EXTVER" header value for the
*        required extension, the fourth is the integer FITS "EXTLEVEL"
*        header value for the required extension, and the fifth is
c        a pointer to
*        the inherited integer status value.
*
*        The call-back should read the entire contents (header and data)
*        of the binary table in the named extension of the external FITS
*        file, storing the contents in a newly created FitsTable object. It
*        should then store this FitsTable in the FitsChan using the
c        astPutTables or astPutTable
f        AST_PUTTABLES or AST_PUTTABLE
*        method, and finally annull its local copy of the FitsTable pointer.
*        If the table cannot be read for any reason, or if any other
*        error occurs, it should return a non-zero integer for the final
*        (third) argument.
*
c        If "tabsource" is NULL,
f        If TABSOURCE is AST_NULL,
*        any registered call-back function will be removed.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Notes:
c     - Application code can pass arbitrary data (such as file
c     descriptors, etc) to the table source function using the
c     astPutChannelData function. The source function should use
c     the astChannelData macro to retrieve this data.
f     - The name  of the routine supplied for the TABSOURCE
f     argument should appear in an EXTERNAL statement in the Fortran
f     routine which invokes AST_TABLESOURCE. However, this is not generally
f     necessary for the null routine AST_NULL (so long as the AST_PAR
f     include file has been used).
f     - Note that the null routine AST_NULL (one underscore) is
f     different to AST__NULL (two underscores), which is the null Object
f     pointer.

*  Description:
*     This function returns a Mapping that has "nwcs" inputs and outputs,
*     where "nwcs" is the number of FITS WCS axes defined in the supplied
*     FitsStore. The inputs and outputs are in the same order as the

*     axes, the transformation will implement the relevant coordinate
*     look-up function.

*  Parameters:
*     this

*     tabaxis
*        Address of a location at which to store a pointer to an array of
*        flags, one for each output of the returned Mapping. A flag will
*        be non-zero if the corresponding output of the returned Mapping
*        corresponds to a -TAB axis. A NULL pointer is returned if the
*        returned Mapping is NULL.
*     method
*        A pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.

*        read. This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to a Mapping. A NULL pointer is returned if the FitsChan does
*     not support the -TAB algorithm (i.e. if the value of the TabOK
*     attribute is zero or negative), or if no axes use the "-TAB" algorithm.

*        it. No more than 80 characters are read from this string.
c     there
f     THERE = LOGICAL (Returned)
c        Pointer to an integer which will be returned holding a non-zero
c        value if the keyword was found in the header, and zero otherwise.
f        A value of .TRUE. will be returned if the keyword was found in the
f        header, and .FALSE. otherwise.
*        This parameter allows a distinction to be made between the case
*        where a keyword is not present, and the case where a keyword is
*        present but has no associated value.
c        A NULL pointer may be supplied if this information is not

*        A value of zero

*        is returned if the keyword was not found in the FitsChan or has
*        no associated value. Otherwise, a value of
c        one
f        .TRUE.
*        is returned.

*  Notes:
*     -  The current card is left unchanged by this function.
*     -  The card following the current card is checked first. If this is
*     not the required card, then the rest of the FitsChan is searched,
*     starting with the first card added to the FitsChan. Therefore cards
*     should be accessed in the order they are stored in the FitsChan (if
*     possible) as this will minimise the time spent searching for cards.
*     -  An error will be reported if the keyword name does not conform
*     to FITS requirements.
c     -  Zero
f     -  .FALSE.
*     is returned as the function value if an error has already occurred,
*     or if this function should fail for any reason.

/*
*  Name:
*     WcsCelestial

*  Purpose:
*     Create a Mapping from intermediate world coords to celestial coords
*     as described in a FITS header.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     AstMapping *WcsCelestial( AstFitsChan *this, FitsStore *store, char s,
*                               AstFrame **frm, AstFrame *iwcfrm, double *reflon, double *reflat,
*                               AstSkyFrame **reffrm, , AstMapping **tabmap,
*                               int *tabaxis, const char *method,
*                               const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     This function interprets the contents of the supplied FitsStore
*     structure, looking for world coordinate axes which describe positions
*     on the sky. If a pair of such longitude/latitude axes is found, a
*     Mapping is returned which transforms the corresponding intermediate
*     world coordinates to celestial world coordinates (this mapping leaves
*     any other axes unchanged). It also, modifies the supplied Frame to
*     describe the axes (again, other axes are left unchanged). If no
*     pair of celestial axes is found, a UnitMap is returned, and the
*     supplied Frame is left unchanged.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The FitsChan.
*     store
*        A structure containing information about the requested axis
*        descriptions derived from a FITS header.
*     s
*        A character identifying the co-ordinate version to use. A space
*        means use primary axis descriptions. Otherwise, it must be an
*        upper-case alphabetical characters ('A' to 'Z').
*     frm
*        The address of a location at which to store a pointer to the
*        Frame describing the world coordinate axes.
*     iwcfrm
*        A pointer to the Frame describing the intermediate world coordinate
*        axes. The properties of this Frame may be changed on exit.
*     reflon
*        Address of a location at which to return the celestial longitude
*        at the reference point. It is returned as AST__BAD if no
*        celestial coordinate frame is found.
*     reflat
*        Address of a location at which to return the celestial latitude
*        at the reference point. It is returned as AST__BAD if no
*        celestial coordinate frame is found.
*     reffrm
*        Address of a location at which to return a pointer to a SkyFrame
*        which define the reference values returned in reflon and reflat.
*        It is returned as NULL if no celestial coordinate frame is found.
*     tabmap
*        Address of a pointer to a Mapping describing any -TAB
*        transformations to be applied to the results of the Mapping returned
*        by this function. If any celestial axes are found, the supplied
*        Mapping is modified so that the celestial axes produce values in
*        radians rather than degrees. NULL if no axes are described by -TAB.
*     tabaxis
*        Pointer to an array of flags, one for each WCS axis, indicating
*        if the corresponding WCS axis is described by the -TAB algorithm.
*        NULL if no axes are described by -TAB.
*     method
*        A pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     class
*        A pointer to a string holding the class of the object being
*        read. This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the Mapping.

/*
*  Name:
*     WcsFcRead

*  Purpose:
*     Extract WCS information from a supplied FitsChan using a FITSWCS
*     encoding, and store it in the supplied FitsStore.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     void WcsFcRead( AstFitsChan *fc, AstFitsChan *fc2, FitsStore *store,
*                     const char *method, const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function extracts FITSWCS keywords from the supplied FitsChan,
*     and stores the corresponding WCS information in the supplied FitsStore.

*  Parameters:
*     fc
*        Pointer to the FitsChan containing the cards read from the
*        original FITS header. This should not include any un-used
*        non-standard keywords.
*     fc2
*        Pointer to a second FitsChan. If a card read from "fc" fails to
*        be converted to its correct data type, a warning is only issued
*        if there is no card for this keyword in "fc2". "fc2" may be NULL
*        in which case a warning is always issued.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore structure.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

/*
*  Name:
*     WcsFromStore

*  Purpose:
*     Store WCS keywords in a FitsChan using FITS-WCS encoding.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     int WcsFromStore( AstFitsChan *this, FitsStore *store,
*                       const char *method, const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function copies the WCS information stored in the supplied
*     FitsStore into the supplied FitsChan, using FITS-WCS encoding.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A value of 1 is returned if succesfull, and zero is returned
*     otherwise.

*  Description:
*     A CmpMap is created which rotates the supplied Native Spherical Coords
*     into Celestial Coords in the standard system specified by the CTYPE
*     keywords. Any non-celestial axes are left unchanged.
*
*     At the highest level, the returned CmpMap is made up of the following

*     Mappings in series (if celestial long/lat axes are present):
*        1 - A PermMap which rearranges the axes so that the longitude axis is
*            axis 0, the latitude axis is axis 1, and all other axes are
*            stored at higher indices, starting at axis 2.
*        2 - A CmpMap which converts the values on axes 0 and 1 from Native
*            Spherical to Celestial coordinates, leaving all other axes
*            unchanged.
*        3 - A PermMap which rearranges the axes to put the longitude and
*            latitude axes back in their original places. This is just the
*            inverse of the PermMap used at stage 1 above.
*
*     The CmpMap used at stage 2 above, is made up of two Mappings in

*     parallel:
*         4 - A CmpMap which maps axes 0 and 1 from Native Spherical to
*             Celestial coordinates.
*         5 - A UnitMap which passes on the values to axes 2, 3, etc,
*             without change.
*
*     The CmpMap used at stage 4 above, is made up of the following Mappings

*     in series:
*         6 - A SphMap which converts the supplied spherical coordinates into
*             Cartesian Coordinates.
*         7 - A MatrixMap which rotates the Cartesian coordinates from the
*             Native to the Celestial system.
*         8 - A SphMap which converts the resulting Cartesian coordinates back
*             to spherical coordinates.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The FitsChan in which to store any warning cards. If NULL, no
*        warnings are stored.
*     store
*        A structure containing values for FITS keywords relating to
*        the World Coordinate System.
*     s
*        Co-ordinate version character to use (space means primary axes).
*     wcsmap
*        A mapping describing the deprojection which is being used. This is
*        needed in order to be able to locate the fiducial point within the
*        Native Speherical Coordinate system, since it varies from projection
*        to projection.
*     fits_ilon
*        The zero-based FITS WCS axis index corresponding to celestial
*        longitude (i.e. one less than the value of "i" in the keyword
*        names "CTYPEi", "CRVALi", etc). If -1 is supplied, the index of
*        the longitude axis in the supplied WcsMap is used.
*     fits_ilat
*        The zero-based FITS WCS axis index corresponding to celestial
*        latitude (i.e. one less than the value of "i" in the keyword
*        names "CTYPEi", "CRVALi", etc). If -1 is supplied, the index of
*        the latitude axis in the supplied WcsMap is used.
*     method
*        A pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     class
*        A pointer to a string holding the class of the object being
*        read. This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the created CmpMap or a NULL pointer if an error occurred.

*  Notes:
*     -  The local variable names correspond to the notation in the papers
*     by Greisen & Calabretta describing the FITS WCS system.

/*
*  Name:
*     WcsNatPole

*  Purpose:
*     Find the celestial coordinates of the north pole of the Native Spherical
*     Coordinate system.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:

*     int WcsNatPole( AstFitsChan *this, AstWcsMap *wcsmap, double alpha0,
*                     double delta0, double latpole, double *phip,
*                     double *alphap, double *deltap, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     The supplied WcsMap converts projected positions given in
*     "Projection Plane Coords" to positions in the "Native Spherical
*     Coordinate" system. This function finds the pole of this spherical
*     coordinate system in terms of the standard celestial coordinate
*     system to which the CRVALi, LONPOLE and LATPOLE keywords refer (this
*     system should be identified by characters 5-8 of the CTYPEi
*     keywords). It also supplies a default value for LONPOLE if no value
*     has been supplied explicitly in the FITS header.
*
*     This function implements equations 8, 9 and 10 from the FITS-WCS paper
*     II by Calabretta & Greisen (plus the associated treatment of special
*     cases). The paper provides more detailed documentation for the
*     mathematics implemented by this function.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The FitsChan in which to store any warning cards. If NULL, no
*        warnings are stored.
*     wcsmap
*        A mapping describing the deprojection being used (i.e. the
*        mapping from Projection Plane Coords to Native Spherical Coords).
*     alpha0
*        The longitude of the fiducial point in the standard celestial
*        coordinate frame (in radians). Note, this fiducial point does
*        not necessarily correspond to the point given by keywords CRPIXj.
*     delta0
*        The celestial latitude (radians) of the fiducial point.
*     latpole
*        The value of FITS keyword LATPOLE, converted to radians, or the
*        symbolic constant AST__BAD if the keyword was not supplied.
*     phip
*        Pointer to a location at which is stored the longitude of the north
*        pole of the standard Celestial coordinate system, as measured in
*        the Native Spherical Coordinate system, in radians. This should be
*        supplied holding the radian equivalent of the value of the FITS
*        keyword LONPOLE, or the symbolic constant AST__BAD if the keyword was
*        not supplied (in which case a default value will be returned at the
*        given location).
*     alphap
*        Pointer to a location at which to store the calculated longitude
*        of the Native North Pole, in radians.
*     deltap
*        Pointer to a location at which to store the calculated latitude
*        of the Native North Pole, in radians.
*     class
*        A pointer to a string holding the class of the object being
*        read. This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A status: non-zero for success, zero if the position of the native
*     north pole is undefined.

*  Notes:
*     -  Certain combinations of keyword values result in the latitude of
*     the Native North Pole being undefined. In these cases, a value of
*     0 is returned for the function value, but no error is reported.
*     -  All angular values used by this function are in radians.
*     -  A value of 0 is returned if an error has already occurred.

/*
*  Name:
*     WcsSpectral

*  Purpose:
*     Create a Mapping from intermediate world coords to spectral coords
*     as described in a FITS header.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:

*     AstMapping *WcsSpectral( AstFitsChan *this, FitsStore *store, char s,
*                              AstFrame **frm, AstFrame *iwcfrm, double reflon,
*                              double reflat, AstSkyFrame *reffrm,
*                              const char *method, const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     This function interprets the contents of the supplied FitsStore
*     structure, looking for world coordinate axes which describe positions
*     in a spectrum. If such an axis is found, a Mapping is returned which
*     transforms the corresponding intermediate world coordinates to
*     spectral world coordinates (this mapping leaves any other axes
*     unchanged). It also, modifies the supplied Frame to describe the
*     axis (again, other axes are left unchanged). If no spectral axis
*     is found, a UnitMap is returned, and the supplied Frame is left
*     unchanged.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The FitsChan.
*     store
*        A structure containing information about the requested axis
*        descriptions derived from a FITS header.
*     s
*        A character identifying the co-ordinate version to use. A space
*        means use primary axis descriptions. Otherwise, it must be an
*        upper-case alphabetical characters ('A' to 'Z').
*     frm
*        The address of a location at which to store a pointer to the
*        Frame describing the world coordinate axes.
*     iwcfrm
*        A pointer to the Frame describing the intermediate world coordinate
*        axes. The properties of this Frame may be changed on exit.
*     reflon
*        The reference celestial longitude, in the frame given by reffrm.
*     reflat
*        The reference celestial latitude, in the frame given by reffrm.
*     reffrm
*        The SkyFrame defining reflon and reflat.
*     method
*        A pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     class
*        A pointer to a string holding the class of the object being
*        read. This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the Mapping.

*  Name:
*     WcsToStore

*  Purpose:
*     Extract WCS information from the supplied FitsChan using a FITSWCS

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:

*     void WcsToStore( AstFitsChan *this, AstFitsChan *trans,

*                      const char *class, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function extracts FITSWCS keywords from the supplied FitsChan(s),
*     and stores the corresponding WCS information in the supplied FitsStore.
*     Keywords will be searched for first in "trans", and then, if they
*     are not found in "trans", they will be searched for in "this".

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan containing the cards read from the
*        original FITS header. This may include non-standard keywords.
*     trans
*        Pointer to a FitsChan containing cards representing standard
*        translations of any non-standard keywords in "this". A NULL
*        pointer indicates that "this" contains no non-standard keywords.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore structure.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Description:
*     This function finds the association between the axes of the final

*     system. This may not simply be a 1-to-1 association because the
*     Mapping may include a PermMap. Each output axis is associated with
*     the input axis which is most nearly aligned with it.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     cmap
*        Pointer to the Mapping from pixel coordinates to final world
*        coordinates.
*     dim
*        Pointer to an array with one element for each input of "map",
*        supplied holding the no. of pixels in the data cube along the axis, or
*        AST__BAD If unknown.
*     perm
*        Pointer to an array with one element for each output of "map".
*        On exit, each element of this array holds the zero-based index of the
*        "corresponding" (i.e. most nearly parallel) pixel axis.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     Non-zero for success - zero for failure.

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     This function writes a named double value, representing the
*     value of a class instance variable, to the data sink associated
*     with a FitsChan. It is intended for use by class "Dump"
*     functions when writing out class information which will
*     subsequently be re-read.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        name to be used to identify the value in the external
*        representation. This will form the key for identifying it
*        again when it is re-read. The name supplied should be unique
*        within its class.
*
*        Mixed case may be used and will be preserved in the external
*        representation (where possible) for cosmetic effect. However,
*        case is not significant when re-reading values.
*
*        It is recommended that a maximum of 6 alphanumeric characters
*        (starting with an alphabetic character) be used. This permits
*        maximum flexibility in adapting to standard external data
*        representations (e.g. FITS).
*     set
*        If this is zero, it indicates that the value being written is
*        a default value (or can be re-generated from other values) so
*        need not necessarily be written out. Such values will
*        typically be included in the external representation with
*        (e.g.) a comment character so that they are available to
*        human readers but will be ignored when re-read. They may also
*        be completely omitted in some circumstances.
*
*        If "set" is non-zero, the value will always be explicitly
*        included in the external representation so that it can be
*        re-read.
*     helpful
*        This flag provides a hint about whether a value whose "set"
*        flag is zero (above) should actually appear at all in the
*        external representaton.
*
*        If the external representation allows values to be "commented
*        out" then, by default, values will be included in this form
*        only if their "helpful" flag is non-zero. Otherwise, they
*        will be omitted entirely. When possible, omitting the more
*        obscure values associated with a class is recommended in
*        order to improve readability.
*
*        This default behaviour may be further modified if the
*        FitsChan's Full attribute is set - either to permit all
*        values to be shown, or to suppress non-essential information
*        entirely.
*     value
*        The value to be written.
*     comment
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing a
*        textual comment to be associated with the value.
*
*        Note that this comment may not actually be used, depending on
*        the nature of the FitsChan supplied and the setting of its
*        Comm attribute.

*  Description:
*     This function writes a named int value, representing the

*     with a FitsChan. It is intended for use by class "Dump"
*     functions when writing out class information which will
*     subsequently be re-read.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        name to be used to identify the value in the external
*        representation. This will form the key for identifying it

*        It is recommended that a maximum of 6 alphanumeric characters
*        (starting with an alphabetic character) be used. This permits
*        maximum flexibility in adapting to standard external data
*        representations (e.g. FITS).

*        If this is zero, it indicates that the value being written is
*        a default value (or can be re-generated from other values) so
*        need not necessarily be written out. Such values will
*        typically be included in the external representation with
*        (e.g.) a comment character so that they are available to
*        human readers but will be ignored when re-read. They may also
*        be completely omitted in some circumstances.
*
*        If "set" is non-zero, the value will always be explicitly
*        included in the external representation so that it can be
*        re-read.
*     helpful
*        This flag provides a hint about whether a value whose "set"
*        flag is zero (above) should actually appear at all in the
*        external representaton.
*
*        If the external representation allows values to be "commented

/* Encoding. */
/* ========= */

/*
*att++
*  Name:
*     Encoding

*  Purpose:
*     System for encoding Objects as FITS headers.

*  Type:
*     Public attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     String.

*  Description:
*     This attribute specifies the encoding system to use when AST
*     Objects are stored as FITS header cards in a FitsChan. It
c     affects the behaviour of the astWrite and astRead functions when
f     affects the behaviour of the AST_WRITE and AST_READ routines when
*     they are used to transfer any AST Object to or from an external
*     representation consisting of FITS header cards (i.e. whenever a
*     write or read operation is performed using a FitsChan as the I/O
*     Channel).
*
*     There are several ways (conventions) by which coordinate system
*     information may be represented in the form of FITS headers and
*     the Encoding attribute is used to specify which of these should
*     be used. The encoding options available are outlined in the
*     "Encodings Available" section below, and in more detail in the
*     sections which follow.
*
*     Encoding systems differ in the range of possible Objects
*     (e.g. classes) they can represent, in the restrictions they
*     place on these Objects (e.g. compatibility with some
*     externally-defined coordinate system model) and in the number of
*     Objects that can be stored together in any particular set of
*     FITS header cards (e.g. multiple Objects, or only a single
*     Object). The choice of encoding also affects the range of
*     external applications which can potentially read and interpret
*     the FITS header cards produced.
*
*     The encoding options available are not necessarily mutually
*     exclusive, and it may sometimes be possible to store multiple
*     Objects (or the same Object several times) using different
*     encodings within the same set of FITS header cards. This
*     possibility increases the likelihood of other applications being
*     able to read and interpret the information.
*
*     By default, a FitsChan will attempt to determine which encoding
*     system is already in use, and will set the default Encoding
*     value accordingly (so that subsequent I/O operations adopt the
*     same conventions). It does this by looking for certain critical
*     FITS keywords which only occur in particular encodings. For
*     details of how this works, see the "Choice of Default Encoding"
*     section below. If you wish to ensure that a particular encoding
*     system is used, independently of any FITS cards already present,
*     you should set an explicit Encoding value yourself.

*  Encodings Available:
*     The Encoding attribute can take any of the following (case
*     insensitive) string values to select the corresponding encoding

*     system:
*
*     - "DSS": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS header
*     cards using the convention developed at the Space Telescope
*     Science Institute (STScI) for the Digitised Sky Survey (DSS)
*     astrometric plate calibrations. The main advantages of this
*     encoding are that FITS images which use it are widely available
*     and it is understood by a number of important and
*     well-established astronomy applications. For further details,
*     see the section "The DSS Encoding" below.
*
*     - "FITS-WCS": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS
*     header cards using the conventions described in the FITS
*     world coordinate system (FITS-WCS) papers by E.W. Greisen,
*     M. Calabretta, et al. The main advantages of this encoding are that
*     it should be understood by any FITS-WCS compliant application and
*     is likely to be adopted widely for FITS data in future. For further
*     details, see the section "The FITS-WCS Encoding" below.
*
*     - "FITS-PC": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS
*     header cards using the conventions described in an earlier draft
*     of the FITS world coordinate system papers by E.W. Greisen and
*     M. Calabretta. This encoding uses a combination of CDELTi and
*     PCiiijjj keywords to describe the scale and rotation of the pixel
*     axes. This encoding is included to support existing data and
*     software which uses these now superceded conventions. In general,
*     the "FITS-WCS" encoding (which uses CDi_j or PCi_j keywords to
*     describe the scale and rotation) should be used in preference to
*     "FITS-PC".
*
*     - "FITS-IRAF": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS
*     header cards using the conventions described in the document
*     "World Coordinate Systems Representations Within the FITS
*     Format" by R.J. Hanisch and D.G. Wells, 1988.  This encoding is
*     currently employed by the IRAF data analysis facility, so its
*     use will facilitate data exchange with IRAF. Its main advantages
*     are that it is a stable convention which approximates to a
*     subset of the propsed FITS-WCS encoding (above). This makes it
*     suitable as an interim method for storing coordinate system
*     information in FITS headers until the FITS-WCS encoding becomes
*     stable. Since many datasets currently use the FITS-IRAF
*     encoding, conversion of data from FITS-IRAF to the final form of
*     FITS-WCS is likely to be well supported.
*
*     - "FITS-AIPS": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS
*     header cards using the conventions originally introduced by the
*     AIPS data analysis facility. This is base on the use of CDELTi and
*     CROTAi keuwords to desribe the scale and rotation of each axis.
*     These conventions have been superceded but are still widely used.
*
*     - "FITS-AIPS++": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS
*     header cards using the conventions used by the AIPS++ project.
*     This is an extension of FITS-AIPS which includes some of the
*     features of FITS-IRAF and FITS-PC.
*
*     - "FITS-CLASS": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS
*     header cards using the conventions used by the CLASS project.
*     CLASS is a software package for reducing single-dish radio and
*     sub-mm spectroscopic data. See the section "CLASS FITS format" at
*     http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/doc/html/class-html/.
*
*     - "NATIVE": Encodes AST Objects in FITS header cards using a
*     convention which is private to the AST library (but adheres to
*     the general FITS standard) and which uses FITS keywords that
*     will not clash with other encoding systems. The main advantages
*     of this are that any class of AST Object may be encoded, and any
*     (reasonable) number of Objects may be stored sequentially in the
*     same FITS header. This makes FITS headers an almost loss-less
*     communication path for passing AST Objects between applications
*     (although all such applications must, of course, make use of the
*     AST library to interpret the information). For further details,
*     see the section "The NATIVE Encoding" below.

*  Choice of Default Encoding:
*     If the Encoding attribute of a FitsChan is not set, the default
*     value it takes is determined by the presence of certain critical
*     FITS keywords within the FitsChan. The sequence of decisions

*     used to arrive at the default value is as follows:
*
*     - If the FitsChan contains any keywords beginning with the
*     string "BEGAST", then NATIVE encoding is used,
*     - Otherwise, FITS-CLASS is used if the FitsChan contains a DELTAV
*     keyword and a keyword of the form VELO-xxx, where xxx indicates one
*     of the rest frames used by class (e.g. "VELO-LSR"), or "VLSR".
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a CTYPE keyword which
*     represents a spectral axis using the conventions of the AIPS and
*     AIPS++ projects (e.g. "FELO-LSR", etc), then one of FITS-AIPS or
*     FITS-AIPS++ encoding is used. FITS-AIPS++ is used if any of the
*     keywords CDi_j, PROJP, LONPOLE or LATPOLE are
*     found in the FitsChan. Otherwise FITS-AIPS is used.
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
*     "PCiiijjj", where "i" and "j" are single digits, then
*     FITS-PC encoding is used,
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
*     "CDiiijjj", where "i" and "j" are single digits, then
*     FITS-IRAF encoding is used,
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
*     "CDi_j", and at least one of RADECSYS, PROJPi, or CjVALi
*     where "i" and "j" are single digits, then FITS-IRAF encoding is
*     used.
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains any keywords of the form
*     PROJPi, CjVALi or RADECSYS, where "i" and "j" are single digits,
*     then FITS-PC encoding is used.
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
*     CROTAi, where "i" is a single digit, then FITS-AIPS encoding is
*     used.
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
*     CRVALi, where "i" is a single digit, then FITS-WCS encoding is
*     used.
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains the "PLTRAH" keyword, then
*     DSS encoding is used,
*     - Otherwise, if none of these conditions is met (as would be the
*     case when using an empty FitsChan), then NATIVE encoding is
*     used.
*
*     Except for the NATIVE and DSS encodings, all the above checks
*     also require that the header contains at least one CTYPE, CRPIX and
*     CRVAL keyword (otherwise the checking process continues to the next
*     case).
*
*     Setting an explicit value for the Encoding attribute always
*     over-rides this default behaviour.
*
*     Note that when writing information to a FitsChan, the choice of
*     encoding will depend greatly on the type of application you
*     expect to be reading the information in future. If you do not
*     know this, there may sometimes be an advantage in writing the
*     information several times, using a different encoding on each
*     occasion.

*  The DSS Encoding:
*     The DSS encoding uses FITS header cards to store a multi-term
*     polynomial which relates pixel positions on a digitised
*     photographic plate to celestial coordinates (right ascension and
*     declination). This encoding may only be used to store a single
*     AST Object in any set of FITS header cards, and that Object must
*     be a FrameSet which conforms to the STScI/DSS coordinate system
*     model (this means the Mapping which relates its base and current
*     Frames must include either a DssMap or a WcsMap with type
*     AST__TAN or AST__TPN).
*
c     When reading a DSS encoded Object (using astRead), the FitsChan
f     When reading a DSS encoded Object (using AST_READ), the FitsChan
*     concerned must initially be positioned at the first card (its
*     Card attribute must equal 1) and the result of the read, if
*     successful, will always be a pointer to a FrameSet. The base
*     Frame of this FrameSet represents DSS pixel coordinates, and the
*     current Frame represents DSS celestial coordinates. Such a read
*     is always destructive and causes the FITS header cards required
*     for the construction of the FrameSet to be removed from the
*     FitsChan, which is then left positioned at the "end-of-file". A
*     subsequent read using the same encoding will therefore not
*     return another FrameSet, even if the FitsChan is rewound.
*
c     When astWrite is used to store a FrameSet using DSS encoding,
f     When AST_WRITE is used to store a FrameSet using DSS encoding,
*     an attempt is first made to simplify the FrameSet to see if it
*     conforms to the DSS model.  Specifically, the current Frame must
*     be a FK5 SkyFrame; the projection must be a tangent plane
*     (gnomonic) projection with polynomial corrections conforming to
*     DSS requirements, and north must be parallel to the second base
*     Frame axis.
*
*     If the simplification process succeeds, a description of the
*     FrameSet is written to the FitsChan using appropriate DSS FITS
*     header cards. The base Frame of the FrameSet is used to form the
*     DSS pixel coordinate system and the current Frame gives the DSS
*     celestial coordinate system.  A successful write operation will
*     over-write any existing DSS encoded data in the FitsChan, but
*     will not affect other (non-DSS) header cards. If a destructive
*     read of a DSS encoded Object has previously occurred, then an
*     attempt will be made to store the FITS header cards back in
*     their original locations.
*
*     If an attempt to simplify a FrameSet to conform to the DSS model
*     fails (or if the Object supplied is not a FrameSet), then no
c     data will be written to the FitsChan and astWrite will return
f     data will be written to the FitsChan and AST_WRITE will return
*     zero. No error will result.

*  The FITS-WCS Encoding:
*     The FITS-WCS convention uses FITS header cards to describe the
*     relationship between pixels in an image (not necessarily
*     2-dimensional) and one or more related "world coordinate systems".
*     The FITS-WCS encoding may only be used to store a single AST Object
*     in any set of FITS header cards, and that Object must be a FrameSet
*     which conforms to the FITS-WCS model (the FrameSet may, however,
*     contain multiple Frames which will be result in multiple FITS
*     "alternate axis descriptions"). Details of the use made by this
*     Encoding of the conventions described in the FITS-WCS papers are
*     given in the appendix "FITS-WCS Coverage" of this document. A few
*     main points are  described below.
*
*     The rotation and scaling of the intermediate world coordinate system
*     can be specified using either "CDi_j" keywords, or "PCi_j" together
*     with "CDELTi" keywords. When writing a FrameSet to a FitsChan, the
*     the value of the CDMatrix attribute of the FitsChan determines
*     which system is used.
*
*     In addition, this encoding supports the "TAN with polynomial correction
*     terms" projection which was included in a draft of the FITS-WCS paper,
*     but was not present in the final version. A "TAN with polynomial
*     correction terms" projection is represented using a WcsMap with type
*     AST__TPN (rather than AST__TAN which is used to represent simple
*     TAN projections). When reading a FITS header, a CTYPE keyword value
*     including a "-TAN" code results in an AST__TPN projection if there are
*     any projection parameters (given by the PVi_m keywords) associated with
*     the latitude axis, or if there are projection parameters associated
*     with the longitude axis for m greater than 4. When writing a
*     FrameSet to a FITS header, an AST__TPN projection gives rise to a
*     CTYPE value including the normal "-TAN" code, but the projection
*     parameters are stored in keywords with names "QVi_m", instead of the
*     usual "PVi_m". Since these QV parameters are not part of the
*     FITS-WCS standard they will be ignored by other non-AST software,
*     resulting in the WCS being interpreted as a simple TAN projection
*     without any corrections. This should be seen as an interim solution
*     until such time as an agreed method for describing projection
*     distortions within FITS-WCS has been published.
*
*     AST extends the range of celestial coordinate systems which may be
*     described using this encoding by allowing the inclusion of
*     "AZ--" and "EL--" as the coordinate specification within CTYPE
*     values. These form a longitude/latitude pair of axes which describe
*     azimuth and elevation. The geographic position of the observer
*     should be supplied using the OBSGEO-X/Y/Z keywords described in FITS-WCS
*     paper III. Currently, a simple model is used which includes diurnal
*     aberration, but ignores atmospheric refraction, polar motion, etc.
*     These may be added in a later release.
*
*     If an AST SkyFrame that represents offset rather than absolute
*     coordinates (see attribute SkyRefIs) is written to a FitsChan using
*     FITS-WCS encoding, two alternate axis descriptions will be created.
*     One will describe the offset coordinates, and will use "OFLN" and
*     "OFLT" as the axis codes in the CTYPE keywords. The other will
*     describe absolute coordinates as specified by the System attribute
*     of the SkyFrame, using the usual CTYPE codes ("RA--"/"DEC-", etc).
*     In addition, the absolute coordinates description will contain
*     AST-specific keywords (SREF1/2, SREFP1/2 and SREFIS) that allow the
*     header to be read back into AST in order to reconstruct the original
*     SkyFrame.
*
c     When reading a FITS-WCS encoded Object (using astRead), the FitsChan
f     When reading a FITS-WCS encoded Object (using AST_READ), the FitsChan
*     concerned must initially be positioned at the first card (its
*     Card attribute must equal 1) and the result of the read, if
*     successful, will always be a pointer to a FrameSet. The base
*     Frame of this FrameSet represents FITS-WCS pixel coordinates,
*     and the current Frame represents the physical coordinate system
*     described by the FITS-WCS primary axis descriptions. If
*     secondary axis descriptions are also present, then the FrameSet
*     may contain additional (non-current) Frames which represent
*     these.  Such a read is always destructive and causes the FITS
*     header cards required for the construction of the FrameSet to be
*     removed from the FitsChan, which is then left positioned at the
*     "end-of-file". A subsequent read using the same encoding will
*     therefore not return another FrameSet, even if the FitsChan is
*     rewound.
*
c     When astWrite is used to store a FrameSet using FITS-WCS
f     When AST_WRITE is used to store a FrameSet using FITS-WCS
*     encoding, an attempt is first made to simplify the FrameSet to
*     see if it conforms to the FITS-WCS model. If this simplification
*     process succeeds (as it often should, as the model is reasonably
*     flexible), a description of the FrameSet is written to the
*     FitsChan using appropriate FITS header cards. The base Frame of
*     the FrameSet is used to form the FITS-WCS pixel coordinate
*     system and the current Frame gives the physical coordinate
*     system to be described by the FITS-WCS primary axis
*     descriptions.  Any additional Frames in the FrameSet may be used
*     to construct secondary axis descriptions, where appropriate.
*
*     A successful write operation will over-write any existing
*     FITS-WCS encoded data in the FitsChan, but will not affect other
*     (non-FITS-WCS) header cards. If a destructive read of a FITS-WCS
*     encoded Object has previously occurred, then an attempt will be
*     made to store the FITS header cards back in their original
*     locations. Otherwise, the new cards will be inserted following
*     any other FITS-WCS related header cards present or, failing
*     that, in front of the current card (as given by the Card
*     attribute).
*
*     If an attempt to simplify a FrameSet to conform to the FITS-WCS
*     model fails (or if the Object supplied is not a FrameSet), then
c     no data will be written to the FitsChan and astWrite will
f     no data will be written to the FitsChan and AST_WRITE will
*     return zero. No error will result.

*  The FITS-IRAF Encoding:
*     The FITS-IRAF encoding can, for most purposes, be considered as
*     a subset of the FITS-WCS encoding (above), although it differs
*     in the details of the FITS keywords used. It is used in exactly
*     the same way and has the same restrictions, but with the

*     addition of the following:
*
*     - The only celestial coordinate systems that may be represented
*     are equatorial, galactic and ecliptic,
*     - Sky projections can be represented only if any associated
*     projection parameters are set to their default values.
*     - Secondary axis descriptions are not supported, so when writing
*     a FrameSet to a FitsChan, only information from the base and
*     current Frames will be stored.
*
*     Note that this encoding is provided mainly as an interim measure to
*     provide a more stable alternative to the FITS-WCS encoding until the
*     FITS standard for encoding WCS information is finalised.  The name
*     "FITS-IRAF" indicates the general keyword conventions used and does
*     not imply that this encoding will necessarily support all features of
*     the WCS scheme used by IRAF software. Nevertheless, an attempt has
*     been made to support a few such features where they are known to be
*     used by important sources of data.
*
*     When writing a FrameSet using the FITS-IRAF encoding, axis rotations
*     are specified by a matrix of FITS keywords of the form "CDi_j", where
*     "i" and "j" are single digits. The alternative form "CDiiijjj", which
*     is also in use, is recognised when reading an Object, but is never
*     written.
*
*     In addition, the experimental IRAF "ZPX" and "TNX" sky projections will
*     be accepted when reading, but will never be written (the corresponding
*     FITS "ZPN" or "distorted TAN" projection being used instead). However,
*     there are restrictions on the use of these experimental projections.
*     For "ZPX", longitude and latitude correction surfaces (appearing as
*     "lngcor" or "latcor" terms in the IRAF-specific "WAT" keywords) are
*     not supported. For "TNX" projections, only cubic surfaces encoded as
*     simple polynomials with "half cross-terms" are supported. If an
*     un-usable "TNX" or "ZPX" projection is encountered while reading
*     from a FitsChan, a simpler form of TAN or ZPN projection is used
*     which ignores the unsupported features and may therefore be
*     inaccurate. If this happens, a warning message is added to the
*     contents of the FitsChan as a set of cards using the keyword "ASTWARN".
*
*     You should not normally attempt to mix the foreign FITS encodings within
*     the same FitsChan, since there is a risk that keyword clashes may occur.

*  The FITS-PC Encoding:
*     The FITS-PC encoding can, for most purposes, be considered as
*     equivalent to the FITS-WCS encoding (above), although it differs
*     in the details of the FITS keywords used. It is used in exactly
*     the same way and has the same restrictions.

*  The FITS-AIPS Encoding:
*     The FITS-AIPS encoding can, for most purposes, be considered as
*     equivalent to the FITS-WCS encoding (above), although it differs
*     in the details of the FITS keywords used. It is used in exactly
*     the same way and has the same restrictions, but with the

*     addition of the following:
*
*     - The only celestial coordinate systems that may be represented
*     are equatorial, galactic and ecliptic,
*     - Spectral axes can only be represented if they represent
*     frequency, radio velocity or optical velocity, and are linearly
*     sampled in frequency. In addition, the standard of rest
*     must be LSRK, LSRD, barycentric or geocentric.
*     - Sky projections can be represented only if any associated
*     projection parameters are set to their default values.
*     - The AIT, SFL and MER projections can only be written if the CRVAL
*     keywords are zero for both longitude and latitude axes.
*     - Secondary axis descriptions are not supported, so when writing
*     a FrameSet to a FitsChan, only information from the base and
*     current Frames will be stored.
*     - If there are more than 2 axes in the base and current Frames, any
*     rotation must be restricted to the celestial plane, and must involve
*     no shear.

*  The FITS-AIPS++ Encoding:
*     The FITS-AIPS++ encoding is based on the FITS-AIPS encoding, but
*     includes some features of the FITS-IRAF and FITS-PC encodings.
*     Specifically, any celestial projections supported by FITS-PC may be
*     used, including those which require parameterisation, and the axis
*     rotation and scaling may be specified using CDi_j keywords. When
*     writing a FITS header, rotation will be specified using CROTA/CDELT
*     keywords if possible, otherwise CDi_j keywords will be used instead.

*  The FITS-CLASS Encoding:
*     The FITS-CLASS encoding uses the conventions of the CLASS project.
*     These are described in the section "Developer Manual"/"CLASS FITS

*     Format" contained in the CLASS documentation at:
*
*     http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/doc/html/class-html/class.html.
*

*     This encoding is similar to FITS-AIPS with the following restrictions:
*
*     - When a SpecFrame is created by reading a FITS-CLASS header, the
*       attributes describing the observer's position (ObsLat, ObsLon and
*       ObsAlt) are left unset because the CLASS encoding does not specify
*       these values. Conversions to or from the topocentric standard of rest
*       will therefore be inaccurate (typically by up to about 0.5 km/s)
*       unless suitable values are assigned to these attributes after the
*       FrameSet has been created.
*     - When writing a FrameSet to a FITS-CLASS header, the current Frame
*       in the FrameSet must have at least 3 WCS axes, of which one must be
*       a linear spectral axis. The spectral axis in the created header will
*       always describe frequency. If the spectral axis in the supplied
*       FrameSet refers to some other system (e.g. radio velocity, etc),
*       then it will be converted to frequency.
*     - There must be a pair of celestial axes - either (RA,Dec) or
*       (GLON,GLAT). RA and Dec must be either FK4/B1950 or FK5/J2000.
*     - A limited range of projection codes (TAN, ARC, STG, AIT, SFL, SIN)
*       can be used. For AIT and SFL, the reference point must be at the
*       origin of longitude and latitude. For SIN, the associated projection
*       parameters must both be zero.
*     - No rotation of the celestial axes is allowed, unless the spatial
*       axes are degenerate (i.e. cover only a single pixel).
*     - The frequency axis in the created header will always describe
*       frequency in the source rest frame. If the supplied FrameSet uses
*       some other standard of rest then suitable conversion will be applied.
*     - The source velocity must be defined. In other words, the SpecFrame
*       attributes SourceVel and SourceVRF must have been assigned values.
*     - The frequency axis in a FITS-CLASS header does not represent
*       absolute frequency, but instead represents offsets from the rest
*       frequency in the standard of rest of the source.
*
*     When writing a FrameSet out using FITS-CLASS encoding, the current
*     Frame may be temporarily modified if this will allow the header
*     to be produced. If this is done, the associated pixel->WCS Mapping
*     will also be modified to take account of the changes to the Frame.
*     The modifications performed include re-ordering axes (WCS axes, not
*     pixel axes), changing spectral coordinate system and standard of
*     rest, changing the celestial coordinate system and reference equinox,
*     and changing axis units.

*  The NATIVE Encoding:
*     The NATIVE encoding may be used to store a description of any
*     class of AST Object in the form of FITS header cards, and (for
*     most practical purposes) any number of these Object descriptions
*     may be stored within a single set of FITS cards. If multiple
*     Object descriptions are stored, they are written and read
*     sequentially. The NATIVE encoding makes use of unique FITS
*     keywords which are designed not to clash with keywords that have
*     already been used for other purposes (if a potential clash is
*     detected, an alternative keyword is constructed to avoid the
*     clash).
*
*     When reading a NATIVE encoded object from a FitsChan (using
c     astRead), FITS header cards are read, starting at the current
f     AST_READ), FITS header cards are read, starting at the current
*     card (as determined by the Card attribute), until the start of
*     the next Object description is found. This description is then
*     read and converted into an AST Object, for which a pointer is
*     returned. Such a read is always destructive and causes all the
*     FITS header cards involved in the Object description to be
*     removed from the FitsChan, which is left positioned at the
*     following card.
*
*     The Object returned may be of any class, depending on the
*     description that was read, and other AST routines may be used to
*     validate it (for example, by examining its Class or ID attribute
c     using astGetC). If further NATIVE encoded Object descriptions
f     using AST_GETC). If further NATIVE encoded Object descriptions
c     exist in the FitsChan, subsequent calls to astRead will return
f     exist in the FitsChan, subsequent calls to AST_READ will return
*     the Objects they describe in sequence (and destroy their
*     descriptions) until no more remain between the current card and
*     the "end-of-file".
*
c     When astWrite is used to write an Object using NATIVE encoding,
f     When AST_WRITE is used to write an Object using NATIVE encoding,
*     a description of the Object is inserted immediately before the
*     current card (as determined by the Card attribute).  Multiple
*     Object descriptions may be written in this way and are stored
*     separately (and sequentially if the Card attribute is not
*     modified between the writes). A write operation using the NATIVE
*     encoding does not over-write previously written Object
*     descriptions. Note, however, that subsequent behaviour is
*     undefined if an Object description is written inside a
*     previously-written description, so this should be avoided.
*
*     When an Object is written to a FitsChan using NATIVE encoding,
c     astWrite should (barring errors) always transfer data and
f     AST_WRITE should (barring errors) always transfer data and
*     return a value of 1.

*  Applicability:
*     FitsChan
*        All FitsChans have this attribute.

/*
*att++
*  Name:
*     TabOK

*  Purpose:
*     Should the FITS-WCS -TAB algorithm be recognised?

*  Type:
*     Public attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     Integer.

*  Description:
*     This attribute is an integer value which indicates if the "-TAB"
*     algorithm, defined in FITS-WCS paper III, should be supported by
*     the FitsChan. The default value is zero. A zero or negative value
*     results in no support for -TAB axes (i.e. axes that have "-TAB"
*     in their CTYPE keyword value). In this case, the
c     astWrite
f     AST_WRITE
*     method will return zero if the write operation would required the
*     use of the -TAB algorithm, and the
c     astRead
f     AST_READ
*     method will return
c     a NULL pointer
f     AST__NULL
*     if any axis in the supplied header uses the -TAB algorithm.

*     If TabOK is set to a non-zero positive integer, these methods will
*     recognise and convert axes described by the -TAB algorithm, as
*     follows:
*
c     The astWrite
f     The AST_WRITE
*     method will generate headers that use the -TAB algorithm (if
*     possible) if no other known FITS-WCS algorithm can be used to
*     describe the supplied FrameSet. This will result in a table of
*     coordinate values and index vectors being stored in the FitsChan.
*     After the write operation, the calling application should check to
*     see if such a table has been stored in the FitsChan. If so, the
*     table should be retrived from the FitsChan using the
c     astGetTables
f     AST_GETTABLES
*     method, and the data (and headers) within it copied into a new
*     FITS binary table extension. See
c     astGetTables
f     AST_GETTABLES
*     for more information. The FitsChan uses a FitsTable object to store
*     the table data and headers. This FitsTable will contain the required
*     columns and headers as described by FITS-WCS paper III - the
*     coordinates array will be in a column named "COORDS", and the index
*     vector(s) will be in columns named "INDEX<i>" (where <i> is the index
*     of the corresponding FITS WCS  axis). Note, index vectors are only
*     created if required. The EXTNAME value will be set to the value of the
*     AST__TABEXTNAME constant (currently "WCS-TAB"). The EXTVER header
*     will be set to the positive integer value assigned to the TabOK
*     attribute. No value will be stored for the EXTLEVEL header, and should
*     therefore be considered to default to 1.
*
c     The astRead
f     The AST_READ
*     method will generate a FrameSet from headers that use the -TAB
*     algorithm so long as the necessary FITS binary tables are made
*     available. There are two ways to do this: firstly, if the application
*     knows which FITS binary tables will be needed, then it can create a
*     Fitstable describing each such table and store it in the FitsChan
*     (using method
c     astPutTables or astPutTable) before invoking the astRead method.
f     AST_PUTTABLES or AST_PUTTABLE) before invoking the AST_READ method.
*     Secondly, if the application does not know which FITS binary tables
*     will be needed by
c     astRead,
f     AST_READ,
*     then it can register a call-back function with the FitsChan using
*     method
c     astTableSource.
f     AST_TABLESOURCE.
*     This call-back function will be called from within
c     astRead
f     AST_READ
*     if and when a -TAB header is encountered. When called, its arguments
*     will give the name, version and level of the FITS extension containing
*     a required table. The call-back function should read this table from
*     an external FITS file, and create a corresponding FitsTable which
*     it should then return to
c     astRead. Note, currently astRead

*  Synopsis:

*  Description:
*     This attribute is a boolean value which specifies how FITS "CAR"
*     (plate carree, or "Cartesian") projections should be treated when

*     paper II "Representation of Celestial Coordinates in FITS" by

*  Description:
*     This attribute is a boolean value which specifies how FITS "TAN"
*     projections should be treated when reading a FrameSet from a foreign
*     encoded FITS header. If zero, the projection is assumed to conform
*     to the published FITS-WCS standard. If positive, the convention
*     for a distorted TAN projection included in an early draft version
*     of FITS-WCS paper II are assumed. In this convention the
*     coefficients of a polynomial distortion to be applied to
*     intermediate world coordinates are specified by the PVi_m keywords.
*     This convention was removed from the paper before publication and so
*     does not form part of the standard. Indeed, it is incompatible with
*     the published standard because it re-defines the meaning of the
*     first five PVi_m keywords on the longitude axis, which are reserved
*     by the published standard for other purposes. However, headers that
*     use this convention are still to be found, for instance the SCAMP
*     utility (http://www.astromatic.net/software/scamp) creates them.
*
*     The default value for the PolyTan attribute is -1. A negative
*     values causes the used convention to depend on the contents
*     of the FitsChan. If the FitsChan contains any PVi_m keywords for
*     the latitude axis, or if it contains PVi_m keywords for the
*     longitude axis with "m" greater than 4, then the distorted TAN
*     convention is used. Otherwise, the standard convention is used.

*  Synopsis:
*     Integer (boolean).

*  Description:
*     This attribute is a boolean value which specifies how the linear
*     transformation from pixel coordinates to intermediate world
*     coordinates should be represented within a FitsChan when using
*     FITS-WCS encoding. This transformation describes the scaling,
*     rotation, shear, etc., of the pixel axes.
*
*     If the attribute has a non-zero value then the transformation is
*     represented by a set of CDi_j keywords representing a square matrix
*     (where "i" is the index of an intermediate world coordinate axis
*     and "j" is the index of a pixel axis). If the attribute has a zero
*     value the transformation is represented by a set of PCi_j keywords
*     (which also represent a square matrix) together with a corresponding
*     set of CDELTi keywords representing the axis scalings. See FITS-WCS
*     paper II "Representation of Celestial Coordinates in FITS" by
*     M. Calabretta & E.W. Greisen, for a complete description of these two
*     schemes.
*
*     The default value of the CDMatrix attribute is determined by the
*     contents of the FitsChan at the time the attribute is accessed. If
*     the FitsChan contains any CDi_j keywords then the default value is
*     non-zero. Otherwise it is zero. Note, reading a FrameSet from a
*     FitsChan will in general consume any CDi_j keywords present in the
*     FitsChan. Thus the default value for CDMatrix following a read will
*     usually be zero, even if the FitsChan originally contained some
*     CDi_j keywords. This behaviour is similar to that of the Encoding
*     attribute, the default value for which is determined by the contents
*     of the FitsChan at the time the attribute is accessed. If you wish
*     to retain the original value of the CDMatrix attribute (that is,
*     the value before reading the FrameSet) then you should enquire the

*  Description:
*     This read-only attribute is a space separated list of all the conditions
*     names recognized by the Warnings attribute. The names are listed
*     below.

*  Conditions:
*     The following conditions are currently recognised (all are
*     case-insensitive):
*
*     - "BadCel": This condition arises when reading a FrameSet from a
*     non-Native encoded FitsChan if an unknown celestial co-ordinate
*     system is specified by the CTYPE keywords.
*
*     - "BadCTYPE": This condition arises when reading a FrameSet from a
*     non-Native encoded FitsChan if an illegal algorithm code is specified
*     by a CTYPE keyword, and the illegal code can be converted to an
*     equivalent legal code.
*
*     - "BadKeyName": This condition arises if a FITS keyword name is
*     encountered that contains an illegal character (i.e. one not allowed
*     by the FITS standard).
*
*     - "BadLat": This condition arises when reading a FrameSet from a
*     non-Native encoded FitsChan if the latitude of the reference point
*     has an absolute value greater than 90 degrees. The actual absolute
*     value used is set to exactly 90 degrees in these cases.
*
*     - "BadMat": This condition arises if the matrix describing the
*     transformation from pixel offsets to intermediate world coordinates
*     cannot be inverted. This matrix describes the scaling, rotation, shear,
*     etc., applied to the pixel axes, and is specified by keywords such as
*     PCi_j, CDi_j, CROTA, etc. For example, the matrix will not be invertable
*     if any rows or columns consist entirely of zeros. The FITS-WCS Paper I
*     "Representation of World Coordinates in FITS" by Greisen & Calabretta
*     requires that this matrix be invertable. Many operations (such as
*     grid plotting) will not be possible if the matrix cannot be inverted.
*
*     - "BadPV": This condition arises when reading a FrameSet from a
*     non-Native encoded FitsChan. It is issued if a PVi_m header is found
*     that refers to a projection parameter that is not used by the
*     projection type specified by CTYPE, or the PV values are otherwise
*     inappropriate for the projection type.
*
*     - "BadVal": This condition arises when reading a FrameSet from a
*     non-Native encoded FitsChan if it is not possible to convert the
*     value of a FITS keywords to the expected type. For instance, this
*     can occur if the FITS header contains a string value for a keyword
*     which should have a floating point value, or if the keyword has no
*     value at all (i.e. is a comment card).
*
*     - "Distortion": This condition arises when reading a FrameSet from a
*     non-Native encoded FitsChan if any of the CTYPE keywords specify an
*     unsupported distortion code using the "4-3-3" format specified in
*     FITS-WCS paper IV. Such distortion codes are ignored.
*
*     - "NoCTYPE": This condition arises if a default CTYPE value is used
c     within astRead, due to no value being present in the supplied FitsChan.
f     within AST_READ, due to no value being present in the supplied FitsChan.
*     This condition is only tested for when using non-Native encodings.
*
*     - "NoEquinox": This condition arises if a default equinox value is used
c     within astRead, due to no value being present in the supplied FitsChan.
f     within AST_READ, due to no value being present in the supplied FitsChan.
*     This condition is only tested for when using non-Native encodings.
*
*     - "NoRadesys": This condition arises if a default reference frame is
c     used for an equatorial co-ordinate system within astRead, due to no
f     used for an equatorial co-ordinate system within AST_READ, due to no
*     value being present in the supplied FitsChan. This condition is only
*     tested for when using non-Native encodings.
*
*     - "NoLonpole": This condition arises if a default value is used for
c     the LONPOLE keyword within astRead, due to no value being present
f     the LONPOLE keyword within AST_READ, due to no value being present
*     in the supplied FitsChan. This condition is only tested for when
*     using non-Native encodings.
*
*     - "NoLatpole": This condition arises if a default value is used for
c     the LATPOLE keyword within astRead, due to no value being present
f     the LATPOLE keyword within AST_READ, due to no value being present
*     in the supplied FitsChan. This condition is only tested for when
*     using non-Native encodings.
*
*     - "NoMjd-obs": This condition arises if a default value is used for
c     the date of observation within astRead, due to no value being present
f     the date of observation within AST_READ, due to no value being present
*     in the supplied FitsChan. This condition is only tested for when using
*     non-Native encodings.
*
*     - "Tnx": This condition arises if a FrameSet is read from a FITS
*     header containing an IRAF "TNX" projection which includes terms
*     not supproted by AST. Such terms are ignored and so the resulting
*     FrameSet may be inaccurate.
*
*     - "Zpx": This condition arises if a FrameSet is read from a FITS
*     header containing an IRAF "ZPX" projection which includes "lngcor"
*     or "latcor" correction terms. These terms are not supported by AST
*     and are ignored. The resulting FrameSet may therefore be inaccurate.

c     AstFitsChan *astFitsChan( const char *(* source)( void ),
c                               void (* sink)( const char * ),

f     RESULT = AST_FITSCHAN( SOURCE, SINK, OPTIONS, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan constructor.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new FitsChan and optionally initialises
*     its attributes.
*
*     A FitsChan is a specialised form of Channel which supports I/O
*     operations involving the use of FITS (Flexible Image Transport
*     System) header cards. Writing an Object to a FitsChan (using
c     astWrite) will, if the Object is suitable, generate a
f     AST_WRITE) will, if the Object is suitable, generate a
*     description of that Object composed of FITS header cards, and
*     reading from a FitsChan will create a new Object from its FITS
*     header card description.
*
*     While a FitsChan is active, it represents a buffer which may
*     contain zero or more 80-character "header cards" conforming to
*     FITS conventions. Any sequence of FITS-conforming header cards
*     may be stored, apart from the "END" card whose existence is
*     merely implied.  The cards may be accessed in any order by using
*     the FitsChan's integer Card attribute, which identifies a "current"
*     card, to which subsequent operations apply. Searches
c     based on keyword may be performed (using astFindFits), new
c     cards may be inserted (astPutFits, astPutCards, astSetFits<X>) and
c     existing ones may be deleted (astDelFits) or changed (astSetFits<X>).
f     based on keyword may be performed (using AST_FINDFITS), new
f     cards may be inserted (AST_PUTFITS, AST_PUTCARDS, AST_SETFITS<X>) and
f     existing ones may be deleted (AST_DELFITS) or changed (AST_SETFITS<X>).
*
*     When you create a FitsChan, you have the option of specifying
*     "source" and "sink" functions which connect it to external data
*     stores by reading and writing FITS header cards. If you provide
*     a source function, it is used to fill the FitsChan with header cards
*     when it is accessed for the first time. If you do not provide a
*     source function, the FitsChan remains empty until you explicitly enter
c     data into it (e.g. using astPutFits, astPutCards, astWrite
f     data into it (e.g. using AST_PUTFITS, AST_PUTCARDS, AST_WRITE
*     or by using the SourceFile attribute to specifying a text file from
*     which headers should be read). When the FitsChan is deleted, any
*     remaining header cards in the FitsChan can be saved in either of
*     two ways: 1) by specifying a value for the SinkFile attribute (the
*     name of a text file to which header cards should be written), or 2)
*     by providing a sink function (used to to deliver header cards to an
*     external data store). If you do not provide a sink function or a
*     value for SinkFile, any header cards remaining when the FitsChan
*     is deleted will be lost, so you should arrange to extract them
*     first if necessary
c     (e.g. using astFindFits or astRead).
f     (e.g. using AST_FINDFITS or AST_READ).
*
*     Coordinate system information may be described using FITS header
*     cards using several different conventions, termed
*     "encodings". When an AST Object is written to (or read from) a
*     FitsChan, the value of the FitsChan's Encoding attribute
*     determines how the Object is converted to (or from) a
*     description involving FITS header cards. In general, different
*     encodings will result in different sets of header cards to
*     describe the same Object. Examples of encodings include the DSS
*     encoding (based on conventions used by the STScI Digitised Sky
*     Survey data), the FITS-WCS encoding (based on a proposed FITS
*     standard) and the NATIVE encoding (a near loss-less way of
*     storing AST Objects in FITS headers).
*
*     The available encodings differ in the range of Objects they can
*     represent, in the number of Object descriptions that can coexist
*     in the same FitsChan, and in their accessibility to other
*     (external) astronomy applications (see the Encoding attribute
*     for details). Encodings are not necessarily mutually exclusive
*     and it may sometimes be possible to describe the same Object in
*     several ways within a particular set of FITS header cards by
*     using several different encodings.
*
c     The detailed behaviour of astRead and astWrite, when used with
f     The detailed behaviour of AST_READ and AST_WRITE, when used with
*     a FitsChan, depends on the encoding in use. In general, however,
c     all use of astRead is destructive, so that FITS header cards
f     all use of AST_READ is destructive, so that FITS header cards
*     are consumed in the process of reading an Object, and are
*     removed from the FitsChan (this deletion can be prevented for
*     specific cards by calling the
c     astRetainFits function).
f     AST_RETAINFITS routine).
*
*     If the encoding in use allows only a single Object description
*     to be stored in a FitsChan (e.g. the DSS, FITS-WCS and FITS-IRAF
c     encodings), then write operations using astWrite will
f     encodings), then write operations using AST_WRITE will
*     over-write any existing Object description using that
*     encoding. Otherwise (e.g. the NATIVE encoding), multiple Object
*     descriptions are written sequentially and may later be read
*     back in the same sequence.

*  Parameters:
c     source
f     SOURCE = FUNCTION (Given)
c        Pointer to a source function which takes no arguments and
c        returns a pointer to a null-terminated string. This function
c        will be used by the FitsChan to obtain input FITS header
c        cards. On each invocation, it should read the next input card
c        from some external source (such as a FITS file), and return a
c        pointer to the (null-terminated) contents of the card. It
c        should return a NULL pointer when there are no more cards to
c        be read.
c
c        If "source" is NULL, the FitsChan will remain empty until
c        cards are explicitly stored in it (e.g. using astPutCards,
c        astPutFits or via the SourceFile attribute).
f        A source routine, which is a function taking two arguments: a
f        character argument of length 80 to contain a FITS card, and an
f        integer error status argument. It should return an integer value.
f        This function will be used by the FitsChan to obtain input
f        FITS header cards. On each invocation, it should read the
f        next input card from some external source (such as a FITS
f        file), and return the contents of the card via its character
f        argument. It should return a function result of one unless
f        there are no more cards to be read, in which case it should
f        return zero. If an error occurs, it should set its error
f        status argument to an error value before returning.
f
f        If the null routine AST_NULL is supplied as the SOURCE value,
f        the FitsChan will remain empty until cards are explicitly
f        stored in it (e.g. using AST_PUTCARDS, AST_PUTFITS or via the
f        SourceFile attribute).
c     sink
f     SINK = SUBROUTINE (Given)
c        Pointer to a sink function that takes a pointer to a
c        null-terminated string as an argument and returns void.  If
c        no value has been set for the SinkFile attribute, this
c        function will be used by the FitsChan to deliver any FITS
c        header cards it contains when it is finally deleted. On
c        each invocation, it should deliver the contents of the character
c        string passed to it as a FITS header card to some external
c        data store (such as a FITS file).
f        A sink routine, which is a subroutine which takes two
f        arguments: a character argument of length 80 to contain a
f        FITS card, and an integer error status argument. If no
f        value has been set for the SinkFile attribute, this routine
f        will be used by the FitsChan to deliver any FITS header cards
f        it contains when it is finally deleted. On each invocation,
f        it should deliver the contents of the character string passed
f        to it as a FITS header card to some external data store (such
f        as a FITS file).  If an error occurs, it should set its error
f        status argument to an error value before returning.
*
c        If "sink" is NULL,
f        If the null routine AST_NULL is supplied as the SINK value,
*        and no value has been set for the SinkFile attribute, the
*        contents of the FitsChan will be lost when it is deleted.
c     options
f     OPTIONS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing an optional
c        comma-separated list of attribute assignments to be used for
c        initialising the new FitsChan. The syntax used is identical to
c        that for the astSet function and may include "printf" format
c        specifiers identified by "%" symbols in the normal way.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan constructor.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new FitsChan from a foreign language
*     interface and optionally initialises its attributes.
*
*     A FitsChan implements FITS input/output for the AST library.
*     Writing an Object to a FitsChan (using astWrite) will generate a
*     textual representation of that Object in terms of FITS header cards,
*     and reading from a FitsChan (using astRead) will create a new Object
*     from its FITS representation.
*
*     Normally, when you use a FitsChan, you should provide "source"
*     and "sink" functions which connect it to an external data store
*     by reading and writing the resulting text. This function also
*     requires you to provide "wrapper" functions which will invoke
*     the source and sink functions.

*  Parameters:
*     source
*        Pointer to a "source" function which will be used to obtain
*        FITS header cards. Generally, this will be obtained by
*        casting a pointer to a source function which is compatible
*        with the "source_wrap" wrapper function (below). The pointer
*        should later be cast back to its original type by the
*        "source_wrap" function before the function is invoked.
*
*        If "source" is NULL, the FitsChan will remain empty until
*        cards are added explicitly (e.g. using astPutCards or astPutFits).
*     source_wrap
*        Pointer to a function which can be used to invoke the
*        "source" function supplied (above). This wrapper function is
*        necessary in order to hide variations in the nature of the
*        source function, such as may arise when it is supplied by a
*        foreign (non-C) language interface.
*
*        The single parameter of the "source_wrap" function is a
*        pointer to the "source" function, and it should cast this
*        function pointer (as necessary) and invoke the function with
*        appropriate arguments to obtain the next FITS header card.
*        The "source_wrap" function should then return a pointer
*        to a dynamically allocated, null terminated string containing
*        the text that was read. The string will be freed (using
*        astFree) when no longer required and the "source_wrap"
*        function need not concern itself with this. A NULL pointer
*        should be returned if there is no more input to read.
*
*        If "source" is NULL, the FitsChan will remain empty until
*        cards are added explicitly (e.g. using astPutCards or astPutFits).
*     sink
*        Pointer to a "sink" function which will be used to deliver
*        FITS header cards. Generally, this will be obtained by
*        casting a pointer to a sink function which is compatible with
*        the "sink_wrap" wrapper function (below). The pointer should
*        later be cast back to its original type by the "sink_wrap"
*        function before the function is invoked.
*
*        If "sink" is NULL, the contents of the FitsChan will not be
*        written out before being deleted.
*     sink_wrap
*        Pointer to a function which can be used to invoke the "sink"
*        function supplied (above). This wrapper function is necessary
*        in order to hide variations in the nature of the sink
*        function, such as may arise when it is supplied by a foreign
*        (non-C) language interface.
*
*        The first parameter of the "sink_wrap" function is a pointer
*        to the "sink" function, and the second parameter is a pointer
*        to a const, null-terminated character string containing the
*        text to be written.  The "sink_wrap" function should cast the
*        "sink" function pointer (as necessary) and invoke the
*        function with appropriate arguments to deliver the line of
*        output text. The "sink_wrap" function then returns void.
*
*        If "sink_wrap" is NULL, the contents of the FitsChan will not be
*        written out before being deleted.
*     options
*        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing an optional
*        comma-separated list of attribute assignments to be used for
*        initialising the new FitsChan. The syntax used is identical to
*        that for the astSet function and may include "printf" format
*        specifiers identified by "%" symbols in the normal way.
*     ...
*        If the "options" string contains "%" format specifiers, then
*        an optional list of additional arguments may follow it in
*        order to supply values to be substituted for these
*        specifiers. The rules for supplying these are identical to
*        those for the astSet function (and for the C "printf"
*        function).

*  Returned Value:
*     astFitsChanFor()
*        A pointer to the new FitsChan.

*  Notes:
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
*     function is invoked with the global error status set, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.
*     - This function is only available through the public interface
*     to the FitsChan class (not the protected interface) and is
*     intended solely for use in implementing foreign language
*     interfaces to this class.
*-

*  Implememtation Notes:
*     - This function behaves exactly like astFitsChanId_, in that it
*     returns ID values and not true C pointers, but it has two
*     additional arguments. These are pointers to the "wrapper
*     functions" which are needed to accommodate foreign language
*     interfaces.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan initialiser.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided for use by class implementations to
*     initialise a new FitsChan object. It allocates memory (if
*     necessary) to accommodate the FitsChan plus any additional data
*     associated with the derived class.  It then initialises a
*     FitsChan structure at the start of this memory. If the "init"
*     flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a virtual
*     function table for a FitsChan at the start of the memory passed
*     via the "vtab" parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory in which the FitsChan is to be
*        initialised.  This must be of sufficient size to accommodate
*        the FitsChan data (sizeof(FitsChan)) plus any data used by the
*        derived class. If a value of NULL is given, this function
*        will allocate the memory itself using the "size" parameter to
*        determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the FitsChan (plus derived class
*        data).  This will be used to allocate memory if a value of
*        NULL is given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also
*        stored in the FitsChan structure, so a valid value must be
*        supplied even if not required for allocating memory.
*     init
*        A boolean flag indicating if the FitsChan's virtual function
*        table is to be initialised. If this value is non-zero, the
*        virtual function table will be initialised by this function.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be
*        associated with the new FitsChan.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which
*        contains the name of the class to which the new object
*        belongs (it is this pointer value that will subsequently be
*        returned by the astGetClass method).
*     source
*        Pointer to a "source" function which will be used to obtain
*        FITS header cards. Generally, this will be obtained by
*        casting a pointer to a source function which is compatible
*        with the "source_wrap" wrapper function (below). The pointer
*        should later be cast back to its original type by the
*        "source_wrap" function before the function is invoked.
*
*        If "source" is NULL, the FitsChan will remain empty until
*        cards are added explicitly (e.g. using astPutCards or astPutFits).
*     source_wrap
*        Pointer to a function which can be used to invoke the
*        "source" function supplied (above). This wrapper function is
*        necessary in order to hide variations in the nature of the
*        source function, such as may arise when it is supplied by a
*        foreign (non-C) language interface.
*
*        The single parameter of the "source_wrap" function is a
*        pointer to the "source" function, and it should cast this
*        function pointer (as necessary) and invoke the function with
*        appropriate arguments to obtain the next FITS header card.
*        The "source_wrap" function should then return a pointer
*        to a dynamically allocated, null terminated string containing
*        the text that was read. The string will be freed (using
*        astFree) when no longer required and the "source_wrap"
*        function need not concern itself with this. A NULL pointer
*        should be returned if there is no more input to read.
*
*        If "source" is NULL, the FitsChan will remain empty until
*        cards are added explicitly (e.g. using astPutCards or astPutFits).
*     sink
*        Pointer to a "sink" function which will be used to deliver
*        FITS header cards. Generally, this will be obtained by
*        casting a pointer to a sink function which is compatible with
*        the "sink_wrap" wrapper function (below). The pointer should
*        later be cast back to its original type by the "sink_wrap"
*        function before the function is invoked.
*
*        If "sink" is NULL, the contents of the FitsChan will not be
*        written out before being deleted.
*     sink_wrap
*        Pointer to a function which can be used to invoke the "sink"
*        function supplied (above). This wrapper function is necessary
*        in order to hide variations in the nature of the sink
*        function, such as may arise when it is supplied by a foreign

*
*        The first parameter of the "sink_wrap" function is a pointer
*        to the "sink" function, and the second parameter is a pointer
*        to a const, null-terminated character string containing the

/*
*+
*  Name:
*     astLoadFitsChan

*  Purpose:
*     Load a FitsChan.

*  Type:
*     Protected function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     AstFitsChan *astLoadFitsChan( void *mem, size_t size,
*                                   AstFitsChanVtab *vtab, const char *name,
*                                   AstChannel *channel )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan loader.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided to load a new FitsChan using data read
*     from a Channel. It first loads the data used by the parent class
*     (which allocates memory if necessary) and then initialises a
*     FitsChan structure in this memory, using data read from the input
*     Channel.
*
*     If the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a
*     virtual function table for a FitsChan at the start of the memory
*     passed via the "vtab" parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory into which the FitsChan is to be
*        loaded.  This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the
*        FitsChan data (sizeof(FitsChan)) plus any data used by derived
*        classes. If a value of NULL is given, this function will
*        allocate the memory itself using the "size" parameter to
*        determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the FitsChan (plus derived class
*        data).  This will be used to allocate memory if a value of
*        NULL is given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also
*        stored in the FitsChan structure, so a valid value must be
*        supplied even if not required for allocating memory.
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "size" value is ignored
*        and sizeof(AstFitsChan) is used instead.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be
*        associated with the new FitsChan. If this is NULL, a pointer
*        to the (static) virtual function table for the FitsChan class
*        is used instead.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which
*        contains the name of the class to which the new object
*        belongs (it is this pointer value that will subsequently be
*        returned by the astGetClass method).
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "name" value is ignored
*        and a pointer to the string "FitsChan" is used instead.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new FitsChan.

*  Notes:
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.
