*  Name:
*     FitsChan

*  Purpose:
*     I/O Channel using FITS header cards to represent Objects.

*  Constructor Function:
c     astFitsChan
f     AST_FITSCHAN

*  Description:
*     A FitsChan is a specialised form of Channel which supports I/O
*     operations involving the use of FITS (Flexible Image Transport
*     System) header cards. Writing an Object to a FitsChan (using
c     astWrite) will, if the Object is suitable, generate a
f     AST_WRITE) will, if the Object is suitable, generate a
*     description of that Object composed of FITS header cards, and
*     reading from a FitsChan will create a new Object from its FITS
*     header card description.
*
*     While a FitsChan is active, it represents a buffer which may
*     contain zero or more 80-character "header cards" conforming to
*     FITS conventions. Any sequence of FITS-conforming header cards
*     may be stored, apart from the "END" card whose existence is
*     merely implied.  The cards may be accessed in any order by using
*     the FitsChan's integer Card attribute, which identifies a "current"
*     card, to which subsequent operations apply. Searches
c     based on keyword may be performed (using astFindFits), new
c     cards may be inserted (astPutFits) and existing ones may be
c     deleted (astDelFits).
f     based on keyword may be performed (using AST_FINDFITS), new
f     cards may be inserted (AST_PUTFITS) and existing ones may be
f     deleted (AST_DELFITS).
*
*     When you create a FitsChan, you have the option of specifying
*     "source" and "sink" functions which connect it to external data
*     stores by reading and writing FITS header cards. If you provide
*     a source function, it is used to fill the FitsChan with header
*     cards when it is created. If you do not provide a source
*     function, the FitsChan remains empty until you explicitly enter
c     data into it (e.g. using astPutFits or astWrite). If you
f     data into it (e.g. using AST_PUTFITS or AST_WRITE). If you
*     provide a sink function, it is used to deliver any remaining
*     contents of a FitsChan to an external data store when the
*     FitsChan is deleted. If you do not provide a sink function, any
*     header cards remaining when the FitsChan is deleted will be
*     lost, so you should arrange to extract them first if necessary
c     (e.g. using astFindFits or astRead).
f     (e.g. using AST_FINDFITS or AST_READ).
*     
*     Coordinate system information may be described using FITS header
*     cards using several different conventions, termed
*     "encodings". When an AST Object is written to (or read from) a
*     FitsChan, the value of the FitsChan's Encoding attribute
*     determines how the Object is converted to (or from) a
*     description involving FITS header cards. In general, different
*     encodings will result in different sets of header cards to
*     describe the same Object. Examples of encodings include the DSS
*     encoding (based on conventions used by the STScI Digitised Sky
*     Survey data), the FITS-WCS encoding (based on a proposed FITS
*     standard) and the NATIVE encoding (a near loss-less way of
*     storing AST Objects in FITS headers).
*
*     The available encodings differ in the range of Objects they can
*     represent, in the number of Object descriptions that can coexist
*     in the same FitsChan, and in their accessibility to other
*     (external) astronomy applications (see the Encoding attribute
*     for details). Encodings are not necessarily mutually exclusive
*     and it may sometimes be possible to describe the same Object in
*     several ways within a particular set of FITS header cards by
*     using several different encodings.
*
c     The detailed behaviour of astRead and astWrite, when used with
f     The detailed behaviour of AST_READ and AST_WRITE, when used with
*     a FitsChan, depends on the encoding in use. In general, however,
c     all use of astRead is destructive, so that FITS header cards
f     all use of AST_READ is destructive, so that FITS header cards
*     are consumed in the process of reading an Object, and are
*     removed from the FitsChan.
*
*     If the encoding in use allows only a single Object description
*     to be stored in a FitsChan (e.g. the DSS, FITS-WCS and FITS-IRAF
c     encodings), then write operations using astWrite will
f     encodings), then write operations using AST_WRITE will
*     over-write any existing Object description using that
*     encoding. Otherwise (e.g. the NATIVE encoding), multiple Object
*     descriptions are written sequentially and may later be read
*     back in the same sequence.

*  Inheritance:
*     The FitsChan class inherits from the Channel class.

*  Attributes:
*     In addition to those attributes common to all Channels, every
*     FitsChan also has the following attributes:
*
*     - AllWarnings: A list of the available conditions
*     - DefB1950: Use FK4 B1950 as default equatorial coordinates?
*     - Card: Index of current FITS card in a FitsChan
*     - Encoding: System for encoding Objects as FITS headers
*     - FitsDigits: Digits of precision for floating-point FITS values
*     - Ncard: Number of FITS header cards in a FitsChan
*     - Warnings: Produces warnings about selected conditions

*  Functions:
c     In addition to those functions applicable to all Channels, the
c     following functions may also be applied to all FitsChans:
f     In addition to those routines applicable to all Channels, the
f     following routines may also be applied to all FitsChans:

*  History:
*     11-DEC-1996 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     20-MAR-1997 (DSB):
*        Made keyword setting and getting functions protected instead of
*        public. Renamed public methods. Added Ncard attribute.
*     20-MAY-1997 (RFWS):
*        Tidied public prologues.
*     30-JUN-1997 (DSB):
*        Added support for reading post-2000 DATE-OBS strings. Reading DSS
*        or FITS-WCS objects now returns NULL unless the FitsChan is
*        positioned at the start-of-file prior to the read. Bug fixed
*        which caused Ncard to be returned too large by one. Removed
*        dependancy on hard-wired header and footer text in Native
*        FitsChans.
*     18-AUG-1997 (DSB):
*        Bug fixed in WcsNative which caused incorrect CRVAL values
*        to be used if the axes needed permuting. Values assigned to the
*        Projection attribute fo the SkyFrames created by astRead.
*     2-SEP-1997 (DSB):
*        Added the IRAF convention that EPOCH=0.0 really means EPOCH=1950.0
*        (the EPOCH keyword is deprecated in the new FITS-WCS conventions
*        and is taken always as a Besselian epoch).
*     19-SEP-1997 (DSB):
*        Corrected interpretation of the FITS CD matrix. 
*     25-SEP-1997 (DSB):
*        o  Fix bug in LinearMap which caused it always to detect a linear
*        mapping. For instance, this allowed DssMaps to be erroneously 
*        written out using FITS-WCS encoding with a CAR projection.
*        o  Assign a full textual description to SkyFrame's Projection
*        attribute instead of a 3 letter acronym.
*        o  If DATE-OBS >= 1999.0 then DATE-OBS is now written in new 
*        Y2000 format. For DATE-OBS < 1999.0, the old format is written.
*        o  Add new attribute CDMatrix to determine whether PC or CD
*        matrices should be used when writing objects using FITS-WCS
*        encoding.
*        o  Modified the way floating point values are formatted to omit
*        unnecessary leading zeros from the exponent (i.e. E-5 instead of
*        E-05).
*        o  New-line characters at the end of supplied header cards are now 
*        ignored.
*        o  Cater for EQUINOX specified as a string prefixed by B or J
*        rather than as a floating point value (some HST data does this).
*        o  Corrected SetValue so that it always inserts comment cards 
*        rather than over-write existing comment cards. Previously,
*        writing a FrameSet to a DSS encoded FitsChan resulted in all
*        comments cards being stripped except for the last one.
*        o  Reading a FrameSet from a DSS-encoded FrameSet now only
*        removes the keywords actually required to construct the FrameSet.
*        Previously, all keywords were removed.
*        o  The EPOCH and EQUINOX keywords created when a FrameSet is
*        written to a DSS-encoded FitsChan are now determined from the 
*        epoch and equinox of the current Frame, instead of from a copy
*        of the original FitsChan stored within the DssMap.
*        o  The Encoding and CDMatrix attributes, and keyword types are 
*        now stored as strings externally instead of integers.
*     11-NOV-1997 (DSB):
*        o  Assume default of j2000 for DSS EQUINOX value.
*        o  Check for null object pointers in the interfaces for 
*        virtual functions which execute even if an error has previously
*        occurred. Otherwise, a segmentation violation can occur when 
*        trying to find the member function pointer.
*        o  Trailing spaces ignored in Encoding attribute.
*        o  Bugs fixed in FindWcs and SetValue which resulted in WCS cards
*        being written at the wrong place if the supplied FitsChan does not 
*        contain any WCS keywords.
*        o  Default for CDMatrix (if no axis rotation keywords can be found) 
*        changed to 2 (i.e. use "CDi_j" form keywords).
*        o  Write now leaves the current card unchanged if nothing is 
*        written to the FitsChan.
*     17-NOV-1997 (RFWS):
*        Disabled use of CDmatrix. Fixed initialisation problems in
*        astLoadFitsChan.
*     24-NOV-1997 (DSB):
*        Replace references to error code AST__OPT with AST__RDERR.
*     28-NOV-1997 (DSB):
*        o  Function WcsValues modified to prevent it from changing the 
*        current card. Previously, this could cause new cards to be 
*        written to the wrong place in a FITS-WCS encoded FitsChan.
*        o  Description of argument "value" corrected in prologue of
*        function FitsSet.
*        o  Argument "lastkey" removed from function SetValue since it
*        was never used (it was a relic from a previous method of
*        determining where to store new cards). Corresponding changes 
*        have been made to all the functions which create "lastkey" values 
*        or pass them on to SetValue (i.e DescWcs, WcsPrimary, WcsSecondary, 
*        WriteWcs and WriteDss).
*     10-DEC-1997 (DSB):
*        Bug fixed which caused the initial character designating the system 
*        within CTYPE value (eg E in ELON, G in GLON, etc) to be omitted.
*     1-JUN-1998 (DSB):
*        CDELT values of zero are now replaced by a small non-zero value
*        when creating the "pixel-to-relative physical" transformation
*        matrix. Previously, zero CDELT values could cause the matrix to
*        be non-invertable.
*     4-SEP-1998 (DSB):
*        - Indicate that SphMaps created by this class when using FITS-WCS
*        encoding all operate on the unit sphere. This aids simplification.
*        - Fix a bug in StoreFits which caused CD matrices to be indexed 
*        incorrectly (sometimes causing floating exceptions) if they do not
*        describe a celestial longitude/latitude system.
*        - Changed astFindFits to ignore trailing spaces in the keyword 
*        template.
*        - astSplit changed so that an error is not reported if a textual
*        keyword value ends before column 20.
*     7-OCT-1998 (DSB):
*        - Corrected test for linearity in LinearMap to include a factor
*        of the test vector length. Also LinearMap now uses a simplified 
*        Mapping.
*     5-NOV-1998 (DSB):
*        Added FITS-IRAF encoding.
*     9-NOV-1998 (DSB):
*        - Corrected values of macros DSS_ENCODING and MAX_ENCODING.
*        - Corrected erroneous success indication in IrafStore.
*        - Included checks for bad values in function LinearMap.
*     17-NOV-1998 (DSB):
*        The Domain name GRID is now given to the Base Frame in any FrameSets
*        created by astRead when using FitsChans with DSS, FITS-WCS or
*        FITS-IRAF encodings.
*     18-DEC-1998 (DSB):
*        Check for "D" exponents in floating point keyword strings.
*     12-FEB-1998 (DSB):
*        Modified EncodeFloat to avoid exceeding the 20 character FITS 
*        limit wherever possible if FitsDigits is positive.
*     10-MAY-1998 (DSB):
*        Bug fixed in astSplit which caused comments associated with string
*        keywords to be lost when storing the card in a FitsChan.
*     15-JUN-1999 (DSB):
*        Report an error if an unrecognised projection name is supplied.
*     9-DEC-1999 (DSB):
*        - Fixed bug in WcsNatPole which could result in longitude values
*        being out by 180 degrees for cylindrical projections such as CAR.
*        - Only report an "unrecognised projection" error for CTYPE values
*        which look like celestial longitude or latitude axes (i.e. if the 
*        first 4 characters are "RA--", "DEC-", "xLON" or "xLAT", and the
*        fifth character is "-").
*        - Added function SpecTrans to translated keywords related to the 
*        IRAF ZPX projection into keyword for the standard ZPN projection.
*        - Add ICRS as a valid value for the RADECSYS keyword. Since the
*        SkyFrame class does not yet support ICRS, an FK5 SkyFrame is
*        created if RADECSYS=ICRS.
*     16-DEC-1999 (DSB):
*        - Modified SpecTrans so that all keywords used to created a 
*        standard WCS representation from a non-standard one are consumed 
*        by the astRead operation.
*        - Changed the text of ASTWARN cards added to the FitsChan if an
*        IRAF ZPX projection is found to require unsupported corrections.
*        - Simplified the documentation describing the handling of the IRAF 
*        ZPX projection.
*        - Fixed code which assumed that the 10 FITS-WCS projection
*        parameters were PROJP1 -> PROJP10. In fact they are PROJP0 -
*        PROJP9. This could cause projection parameter values to be
*        incorrectly numbered when they are written out upon deletion of 
*        the FitsChan.
*     1-FEB-2000 (DSB):
*        Check that FITS_IRAF encoding is not being used before using a
*        PC matrix when reading WCS information from a header. This is
*        important if the header contains both PC and CD matrices.
*     8-FEB-2000 (DSB):
*        - Header cards are now only consumed by an astRead operation if the
*        operation succeeds (i.e. returns a non-null Object).
*        - The original FITS-WCS encoding has been renamed as FITS-PC (to
*        indicate the use of a PCiiijjj matrix), and a new FITS-WCS
*        encoding has been added.
*        - The disabled CDMatrix attribute has been removed.
*        - Bug in LinearMap corrected which prevented genuinely linear 
*        Mappings from being judged to be linear. This bug was previously
*        fudged (so it now appears) by the introduction of the test vector
*        length factor (see History entry for 7-OCT-1998). This test
*        vector length scale factor has consequently now been removed.
*        - Added FITS-AIPS encoding.
*        - The critical keywords used to select default encoding have been
*        changed.
*        - Support for common flavours of IRAF TNX projections added.
*        - The algorithm used to find a WcsMap in the supplied FrameSet 
*        has been improved so that compound Mappings which contain complex
*        mixtures of parallel and serial Mappings can be translated into
*        FITS-WCS encoding.
*        - Trailing white space in string keyword values is now retained
*        when using foreign encodings to enable correct concatenation where 
*        a string has been split over several keywords. E.g. if 2 string 
*        keywords contain a list of formatted numerical values (e.g. IRAF 
*        WAT... keywords), and the 1st one ends "0.123 " and the next one 
*        begins "1234.5 ", the trailing space at the end of the first keyword 
*        is needed to prevent the two numbers being merged into "0.1231234.5". 
*        Trailing spaces in native encodings is still protected by enclosing 
*        the whole string in double quotes. 
*        - The Channel methods WriteString and GetNextData can now save
*        and restore strings of arbitary length. This is done by storing
*        as much of the string as possible in the usual way, and then
*        storing any remaining characters in subsequent CONTINUE cards,
*        using the FITSIO conventions. This storage and retrieval of long
*        strings is only available for native encodings.
*     19-MAY-2000 (DSB):
*        Added attribute Warnings. Lowered DSS in the priority list
*        of encodings implemented by GetEncoding.
*     6-OCT-2000 (DSB):
*        Increased size of buffers used to store CTYPE values to take
*        account of the possiblity of lots of trailing spaces.
*     5-DEC-2000 (DSB):
*        Add support for the WCSNAME FITS keyword.
*     12-DEC-2000 (DSB):
*        Add a title to each physical, non-celestial coord Frame based on 
*        its Domain name (if any).
*     3-APR-2001 (DSB):
*        -  Use an "unknown" celestial coordinate system, instead of a
*        Cartesian coordinate system, if the CTYPE keywords specify an
*        unknown celestial coordinate system.
*        -  Do not report an error if there are no CTYPE keywords in the 
*        header (assume a unit mapping, like in La Palma FITS files).
*        -  Add a NoCTYPE warning condition.
*        -  Added AllWarnings attribute.
*        -  Ensure multiple copies of identical warnings are not produced.
*        -  Use the Object Ident attribute to store the identifier letter
*        associated with each Frame read from a secondary axis description,
*        so that they can be given the same letter when they are written
*        out to a new FITS file.
*     10-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        - Corrected function value returned by SkySys to be 1 unless an
*        error occurs. This error resulted in CAR headers being produced
*        by astWrite with CRVAL and CD values till in radians rather than 
*        degrees.
*        - Introduced SplitMap2 in order to guard against producing
*        celestial FITS headers for a Mapping which includes more than
*        one WcsMap.
*     13-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        - Modified FixNew so that it retains the current card index if possible.
*        This fixed a bug which could cause headers written out using Native 
*        encodings to be non-contiguous.
*        - Corrected ComBlock to correctly remove AST comment blocks in
*        native encoded fitschans.
*     14-AUG-2001 (DSB:
*        - Modified FixUsed so that it it does not set the current card
*        back to the start of file if the last card in the FitsChan is 
*        deleted.
*     16-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        Modified WcsNative to limit reference point latitude to range
*        +/-90 degs (previously values outside this range were wrapped
*        round onto the opposite meridian). Also added new warning
*        condition "badlat".
*     23-AUG-2001 (DSB):
*        - Re-write LinearMap to use a least squares fit.
*        - Check that CDj_i is not AST__BAD within WcsWithWcs when
*        forming the increments along each physical axis.
*     28-SEP-2001 (DSB):
*        GoodWarns changed so that no error is reported if a blank list
*        of conditions is supplied.
*     12-OCT-2001 (DSB):
*        - Added DefB1950 attribute.
*        - Corrected equations which calculate CROTA when writing 
*        FITS-AIPS encodings.
*        - Corrected equations which turn a CROTA value into a CD matrix.

   used again by subsequent calls to astRead, they should not be recognised
   by public FitsChan methods which search the FitsChan for specified
   cards, and they should not be written out when the FitsChan is deleted.
   This flag was the only flag available in AST V1.4, and was called
   "Del" (for "deleted"). Used cards are retained in order to give an
   indication of where abouts within the header new cards should be placed
   when astWrite is called (i.e. new cards should usually be placed at
   the same point within the header as the cards which they replace). */

   considered as a candidate for inclusion in the construction of an AST 
   Object. If the Object is constructed succesfully, cards flagged as 
   "provisionally used" will be changed to be flagged as "definitely used"
   (using the USED flag). If the Object fails to be constructed
   succesfully (if some required cards are missing from the FitsChan
   for instance), then "provisionally used" cards will be returned to the
   former state which they had prior to the attempt to construct the
   object. */
#define PROVISIONALLY_USED 2

/* "NEW" - This flag indicates that the the card has just been added to
   the FitsChan and may yet proove to be unrequired. For instance if the
   supplied Object is not of an appropriate flavour to be stored using
   the requested encoding, all "new" cards which were added before the

*  Name:
*     AddFrame

*  Purpose:
*     Create a Frame describing a set of axes with a given co-ordinate 
*     version, and add it to the supplied FrameSet.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:

*                    FitsStore *store, char s, const char *method, 
*                    const char *class )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     A Frame is created describing axis with a specific co-ordinate
*     version character, reading information from the supplied FitsStore. 
*     A suitable Mapping is created to connect the new Frame to the pixel 
*     (GRID) Frame in the supplied FrameSet, and the Frame is added into 
*     the FrameSet using this Mapping.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The FitsChan from which the keywords were read. Warning messages
*        are added to this FitsChan if the celestial co-ordinate system is 
*        not recognized. 
*     fset
*        Pointer to the FrameSet to be extended.
*     pixel
*        The index of the pixel (GRID) Frame within fset.
*     store
*        The FitsStore containing the required information extracted from 
*        the FitsChan.
*     s
*        The co-ordinate version character. A space means the primary
*        axis descriptions. Otherwise the supplied character should be 
*        an upper case alphabetical character ('A' to 'Z'). 
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class 
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and 
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function copies the WCS information stored in the supplied 
*     FitsStore into the supplied FitsChan, using FITS-AIPS encoding.
*
*     AIPS encoding is like FITS-WCS encoding but with the following
*     restrictions:
*
*     1) The celestial projection must not have any projection parameters
*     which are not set to their default values. The one exception to this 
*     is that SIN projections are acceptable if the associated projection 
*     parameter PV<axlat>_1 is zero and PV<axlat>_2 = cot( reference point 
*     latitude). This is encoded using the string "-NCP". The SFL projection 
*     is encoded using the string "-GLS". Note, the original AIPS WCS
*     system only recognised a small subset of the currently available
*     projections, but some more recent AIPS-like software recognizes some 
*     of the new projections included in the FITS-WCS encoding. The AIT, 
*     GLS and MER can only be written if the CRVAL keywords are zero for 
*     both longitude and latitude axes.
*
*     2) The celestial axes must be RA/DEC, galactic or ecliptic.   
*
*     3) LONPOLE and LATPOLE must take their default values.
*
*     4) Only primary axis descriptions are written out.
*
*     5) EPOCH is written instead of EQUINOX & RADECSYS, and uses the 
*        IAU 1984 rule ( EPOCH < 1984.0 is treated as a Besselian epoch 
*        and implies RADECSYS=FK4,  EPOCH >= 1984.0 is treated as a 
*        Julian epoch and implies RADECSYS=FK5). The RADECSYS & EQUINOX
*        values in the FitsStore must be consistent with this rule.
*
*     6) Any rotation produced by the CD matrix must be restricted to
*        the celestial plane, and must involve no shear. A CROTA keyword
*        with associated CDELT values are produced instead of the CD
*        matrix.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore.
*     axlon 
*        Index of celestial longitude axis (-1 if there is no celestial
*        longitude axis).
*     axlat
*        Index of celestial latitude axis (-1 if there is no celestial
*        longitude axis).
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class 
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     A value of 1 is returned if succesfull, and zero is returned
*     otherwise.

*  Description:
*     This function produces a copy of the data value for the current card 
*     converted from its stored data type to the supplied data type.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     type
*        The FITS data type in which to return the data value of the
*        current card.
*     buf
*        A pointer to a buffer to recieve the converted value. It is the
*        responsibility of the caller to ensure that a suitable buffer is
*        supplied.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     Zero if the conversion was not possible (in which case NO error is
*     reported), one otherwise.

*  Notes: 
*     -  When converting from floating point to integer, the  floating
*     point value is truncated using a C cast.
*     -  Non-zero numerical values are considered TRUE, and zero
*     numerical values are considered FALSE. Any string starting with a
*     'T' or a 'Y' (upper or lower case) is considered TRUE, and anything 
*     starting with an 'F' or an 'N' (upper or lower case) is considered
*     FALSE. In addition, a dot ('.') may be placed in front of a 'T' or an
*     'F'.
*     -  A logical TRUE value is represented as a real numerical value of
*     one and the character string "Y". A logical FALSE value is represented 
*     by a real numerical value of zero and the character string "N".
*     -  When converting from a string to any numerical value, zero is
*     returned if the string is not a formatted value which can be converted 
*     into the corresponding type using sscanf.
*     - Real and imaginary parts of a complex value should be separated by 
*     spaces within strings. If a string does contains only a single numerical 
*     value, it is assumed to be the real part, and the imaginary part is 
*     assumed to be zero.
*     -  When converting a complex numerical type to a non-complex numerical 
*     type, the returned value is derived from the real part only, the 
*     imaginary part is ignored.
*     -  Zero is returned if an error has occurred, or if this function
*     should fail for any reason.

*  Description:
*     This function looks for a block of comment cards as defined below,

*
*     Comment blocks consist of a contiguous sequence of COMMENT cards. The 
*     text of each card should start and end with the 3 characters "AST".
*     The block is delimited above by a card containing all +'s (except
*     for the two "AST" strings), and below by a card containing all -'s.
*     
*     The block is assumed to start on the card which is adjacent to the
*     current card on entry.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     incr

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     This function takes a name which forms the basis of a FITS
*     keyword and appends a sequence number (encoded as a pair of
*     legal FITS keyword characters) so as to generate a unique FITS
*     keyword which has not previously been used in the FitsChan
*     supplied.
*
*     It is intended for use when several keywords with the same name
*     must be stored in a FitsChan, since to comply strictly with the
*     FITS standard keywords should normally be unique (otherwise
*     external software which processes the keywords might omit one or
*     other of the values).
*
*     An attempt is also made to generate keywords in a form that is
*     unlikely to clash with those from other sources (in as far as
*     this is possible with FITS). In any event, a keyword that
*     already appears in the FitsChan will not be re-used.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        name on which the new keyword should be based. This should be
*        a legal FITS keyword in itself, except that it should be at
*        least two characters shorter than the maximum length, in
*        order to accommodate the sequence number characters.
*
*        If this string is too long, it will be silently
*        truncated. Mixed case is permitted, as all characters
*        supplied are converted to upper case before use.
*     keyword
*        A character array in which the generated unique keyword will
*        be returned, null terminated.

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     This function formats the value using a G format specified in order
*     to use the minimum field width (trailing zeros are not printed). 
*     However, the G specifier does not include a decimal point unless it
*     is necessary. FITS requires that floating point values always include
*     a decimal point, so this function inserts one, if necessary. 

*  Parameters:
*     buf
*        A character string into which the value is written. 
*     digits
*        The number of digits after the decimal point. If the supplied value
*        is negative, the number of digits actually used may be reduced if 
*        the string would otherwise extend beyond the number of columns 
*        allowed by the FITS standard. If the value is positive, the 
*        specified number of digits are always produced, even if it means 
*        breaking the FITS standard.
*     width
*        The minimum field width to use. The value is right justified in 
*        this field width.
*     maxwidth
*        The maximum field width to use. A value of zero is returned if 
*        the maximum field width is exceeded.
*     value
*        The value to format.

*  Returned Value:
*     The field width actually used, or zero if the value could not be
*     formatted. This does not include the trailing null character.

*  Notes:
*     -  If there is room, a trailing zero is also added following the 
*     inserted decimal point.

*  Description:
*     This function calculates a least squares linear fit to the supplied
*     Mapping, if possible. For an n-dimensional position x[], the fit y[] 
*     is given by:
*
*        y[0] = c[0] + d[0]*x[0] + d[1]*x[1] + ...

*        y[3] = ...
*
*     where y[] is an approximation to the result of transforming x[]
*     using the supplied Mapping.
*
*     A square grid of NPFIT x NPFIT test points, equally spaced over the
*     specified array dimensions, is used to calculate the fit.

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        A pointer to the Mapping. A function value of zero is returned
*        (without error) if either the number of inputs or the number of 
*        outputs is not equal to ndim.
*     ndim 
*        The number of axes.
*     dim
*        A pointer to an array holding the ndim dimensions of the data array
*        in pixels (if known). If not know, the array should be filled with
*        AST__BAD values, in which case a step size of 100 pixels will be
*        used for the grid of NPFIT x NPFIT test points.
*     c
*        A pointer to an array in which to store the constant terms. Should
*        have at least ndim elements.
*     d
*        A pointer to an array in which to store the coefficients. Should
*        have at least (ndim*ndim) elements.
*     rms
*        A pointer to a location at which to return the RMS error between
*        the actual test points and the fitted test points.

*  Returned Value:
*     Zero if no fit to the Mapping can be found. One otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  A value of zero is returned if an error has already occurred,
*     or if an error occurs within this function.

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or

*
*     This function creates a new FrameSet containing WCS information
*     stored in the supplied FitsStore. A null pointer is returned and no
*     error is reported if this is not possible.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The FitsChan from which the keywords were read. Warning messages
*        are added to this FitsChan if the celestial co-ordinate system is 
*        not recognized. 
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class 
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new FrameSet, or a null pointer if no FrameSet
*     could be constructed.

*  Notes:
*     -  The pixel Frame is given a title of "Pixel Coordinates", and
*     each axis in the pixel Frame is given a label of the form "Pixel
*     axis <n>", where <n> is the axis index (starting at one).
*     -  The FITS CTYPE keyword values are used to set the labels for any
*     non-celestial axes in the physical coordinate Frames, and the FITS 
*     CUNIT keywords are used to set the corresponding units strings.
*     -  On exit, the pixel Frame is the base Frame, and the physical
*     Frame derived from the primary axis descriptions is the current Frame.
*     - Extra Frames are added to hold any secondary axis descriptions. All
*     axes within such a Frame refer to the same coordinate version ('A',
*     'B', etc).

*     name 
*        A string holding a name for the item of information. A NULL

*     zero, then the test string may contain zero or more matching characters. 
*     Otherwise, the test string must contain exactly the specified number 
*     of matching characters (i.e. 1 to 9). The field width digit may be 
*     omitted, in which case the test string must contain one or more matching 
*     characters. The next character in the template specifies the type of 
*     matching characters and must be one of "d", "c" or "f". Decimal digits 
*     are matched by "d", all upper (but not lower) case alphabetical 
*     characters are matched by "c", and all characters which may legally be 
*     found within a FITS keyword name are matched by "f".

*  Examples:
*     -  The filter "CRVAL1" accepts the single keyword CRVAL1.
*     -  The filter "CRVAL%1d" accepts the single keyword CRVAL0, CRVAL1,
*     CRVAL2, up to CRVAL9.
*     -  The filter "CRVAL%d" accepts any keyword consisting of the string
*     "CRVAL" followed by any integer value.
*     -  The filter "CR%0s1" accepts any keyword starting with the string "CR"
*     and ending with the character "1" (including CR1).

*  Notes:
*     -  The entire FitsChan is searched, irrespective of the setting of
*     the Card attribute.
*     -  If "maxfld" is supplied as zero, "ubnd" and "lbnd" are ignored,
*     but the number of matching cards is still returned as the function value.
*     -  If no matching cards are found in the FitsChan, or if there are no 
*     integer fields in the filter, then the lower and upper bounds are 
*     returned as zero and -1 (i.e. reversed). 
*     -  If an error has already occured, or if this function should fail 
*     for any reason, a value of zero is returned for the function value,
*     and the lower and upper bounds are set to zero and -1.

/*
*++
*  Name:
c     astFindFits
f     AST_FINDFITS

*  Purpose:
*     Find a FITS card in a FitsChan by keyword.

*  Type:
*     Public virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "fitschan.h"
c     int astFindFits( AstFitsChan *this, const char *name, char card[ 81 ],
c                      int inc )
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFITS( THIS, NAME, CARD, INC, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     This function searches for a card in a FitsChan by keyword. The
*     search commences at the current card (identified by the Card
*     attribute) and ends when a card is found whose FITS keyword
*     matches the template supplied, or when the last card in the
*     FitsChan has been searched.
*
*     If the search is successful (i.e. a card is found which matches
c     the template), the contents of the card are (optionally)
f     the template), the contents of the card are
*     returned and the Card attribute is adjusted to identify the card
*     found or, if required, the one following it. If the search is
c     not successful, the function returns zero and the Card attribute
f     not successful, the function returns .FALSE. and the Card attribute
*     is set to the "end-of-file".

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
c     name
f     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated character string containing a
f        A character string containing a
*        template for the keyword to be found. In the simplest case,
*        this should simply be the keyword name (the search is case
*        insensitive and trailing spaces are ignored). However, this
*        template may also contain "field specifiers" which are
*        capable of matching a range of characters (see the "Keyword
*        Templates" section for details). In this case, the first card
*        with a keyword which matches the template will be found. To
*        find the next FITS card regardless of its keyword, you should
*        use the template "%f".
c     card
f     CARD = CHARACTER * ( 80 ) (Returned)
c        An array of at least 81 characters (to allow room for a
c        terminating null)
f        A character variable with at least 80 characters
*        in which the FITS card which is found will be returned.  If
c        the search is not successful (or a NULL pointer is given), a
f        the search is not successful, a
*        card will not be returned.
c     inc
f     INC = LOGICAL (Given)
c        If this value is zero (and the search is successful), the
f        If this value is .FALSE. (and the search is successful), the
*        FitsChan's Card attribute will be set to the index of the card
c        that was found. If it is non-zero, however, the Card
f        that was found. If it is .TRUE., however, the Card
*        attribute will be incremented to identify the card which
*        follows the one found.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astFindFits()
f     AST_FINDFITS = LOGICAL
c        One if the search was successful, otherwise zero.
f        .TRUE. if the search was successful, otherwise .FALSE..

*  Notes:
*     - The search always starts with the current card, as identified
*     by the Card attribute. To ensure you search the entire contents
*     of a FitsChan, you should first clear the Card attribute (using
c     astClear). This effectively "rewinds" the FitsChan.
f     AST_CLEAR). This effectively "rewinds" the FitsChan.
*     - If a search is unsuccessful, the Card attribute is set to the
*     "end-of-file" (i.e. to one more than the number of cards in the
*     FitsChan). No error occurs.
c     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
f     - A value of .FALSE. will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the AST error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Examples:
c     result = astFindFits( fitschan, "%f", card, 1 );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFITS( FITSCHAN, '%f', CARD, .TRUE., STATUS )
*        Returns the current card in a FitsChan and advances the Card
*        attribute to identify the card that follows (the "%f"
*        template matches any keyword).
c     result = astFindFits( fitschan, "BITPIX", card, 1 );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFITS( FITSCHAN, 'BITPIX', CARD, .TRUE., STATUS )
*        Searches a FitsChan for a FITS card with the "BITPIX" keyword
*        and returns that card. The Card attribute is then incremented
*        to identify the card that follows it.
c     result = astFindFits( fitschan, "COMMENT", NULL, 0 );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFITS( FITSCHAN, 'COMMENT', CARD, .FALSE., STATUS )
*        Sets the Card attribute of a FitsChan to identify the next
c        COMMENT card (if any). The card itself is not returned.
f        COMMENT card (if any) and returns that card.
c     result = astFindFits( fitschan, "CRVAL%1d", card, 1 );
f     RESULT = AST_FINDFITS( FITSCHAN, 'CRVAL%1d', CARD, .TRUE., STATUS )
*        Searches a FitsChan for the next card with a keyword of the
*        form "CRVALi" (for example, any of the keywords "CRVAL1",
*        "CRVAL2" or "CRVAL3" would be matched). The card found (if
*        any) is returned, and the Card attribute is then incremented
*        to identify the following card (ready to search for another
*        keyword with the same form, perhaps).

*  Keyword Templates:
*     The templates used to match FITS keywords are normally composed
*     of literal characters, which must match the keyword exactly
*     (apart from case). However, a template may also contain "field
*     specifiers" which can match a range of possible characters. This
*     allows you to search for keywords that contain (for example)
*     numbers, where the digits comprising the number are not known in
*     advance.
*
*     A field specifier starts with a "%" character. This is followed
*     by an optional single digit (0 to 9) specifying a field
*     width. Finally, there is a single character which specifies the
*     type of character to be matched, as follows:
*
*     - "c": matches all upper case letters,
*     - "d": matches all decimal digits,
*     - "f": matches all characters which are permitted within a FITS
*     keyword (upper case letters, digits, underscores and hyphens).
*
*     If the field width is omitted, the field specifier matches one
*     or more characters. If the field width is zero, it matches zero
*     or more characters. Otherwise, it matches exactly the number of
*     characters specified. In addition to this:
*
*     - The template "%f" will match a blank FITS keyword consisting
*     of 8 spaces (as well as matching all other keywords).
*     - A template consisting of 8 spaces will match a blank keyword
*     (only).
*
*     For example:
*
*     - The template "BitPix" will match the keyword "BITPIX" only.
*     - The template "crpix%1d" will match keywords consisting of
*     "CRPIX" followed by one decimal digit.
*     - The template "P%c" will match any keyword starting with "P"
*     and followed by one or more letters.
*     - The template "E%0f" will match any keyword beginning with "E".
*     - The template "%f" will match any keyword at all (including a
*     blank one).

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     This is a family of functions which gets a value for a named keyword 
*     from a FitsChan using one of several different data types. The data 
*     type of the returned value is selected by replacing <X> in the function 
*     name by one of the following strings representing the recognised FITS 
*     data types:
*
*     CF - Complex floating point values.
*     CI - Complex integer values.
*     F  - Floating point values.
*     I  - Integer values.
*     L  - Logical (i.e. boolean) values.
*     S  - String values.
*     CN  - CONTINUE values.
*
*     The "value" parameter should be a pointer with a data type depending on 
*     <X> as follows:
*
*     CF - "double *" (the pointer should point to a 2 element array to
*          receive the real and imaginary parts of the complex value).
*     CI - "int *" (the pointer should point to a 2 element array to
*          receive the real and imaginary parts of the complex value).
*     F  - "double *".
*     I  - "int *".
*     L  - "int *".
*     S  - "char **" (a pointer to a static "char" array is returned at the
*          location given by the "value" parameter, Note, the stored string
*          may change on subsequent invocations of astFitsGetS so a
*          permanent copy should be taken of the string if necessary). 
*     CN - Like "S".

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     name
*        A pointer to a string holding the keyword name. This may be a 
*        complete FITS header card, in which case the keyword to use is 
*        extracted from it. No more than 80 characters are read from this 
*        string.
*     value
*        A pointer to a location at which to return the keyword value.
*        the data type of this parameter depends on <X> as described above.
*        The supplied value is left unchanged if the keyword is not found.

*  Returned Value:
*     astFitsGet<X>()
*        A value of zero is returned if the keyword was not found
*        (no error is reported). 
*        Otherwise, a value of one is returned. 

*  Notes:
*     -  The card following the current card is checked first. If this is
*     not the required card, then the rest of the FitsChan is searched,
*     starting with the first card added to the FitsChan. Therefore cards
*     should be accessed in the order they are stored in the FitsChan (if
*     possible) as this will minimise the time spent searching for cards. 
*     -  If the requested card is found, it becomes the current card, 
*     otherwise the current card is left pointing at the "end-of-file".
*     -  If the stored keyword value is not of the requested type, it is
*     converted into the requested type.
*     -  An error will be reported if the keyword name does not conform
*     to FITS requirements.
*     -  Zero is returned as the function value 
*     if an error has already occurred, or if this function should fail for 
*     any reason.

*  Name:
*     astFitsGetCom

*  Purpose:
*     Get a keyword comment from a FitsChan.

*  Type:
*     Protected virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     int astFitsGetCom( AstFitsChan *this, const char *name, 
*                        char **comment )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan method.

*  Description:
*     This function gets the comment associated with the next occurrence of 
*     a named keyword in a FitsChan. 

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     name
*        A pointer to a 
*        string holding the keyword name. This may be a complete FITS
*        header card, in which case the keyword to use is extracted from 
*        it. No more than 80 characters are read from this string.
*     comment
*        A pointer to a location at which to return a pointer to a string
*        holding the keyword comment. Note, the stored string will change on 
*        subsequent invocations of astFitsGetCom so a permanent copy 
*        should be taken of the string if necessary. 

*  Returned Value:
*     astFitsGetCom()
*        A value of zero is returned if the keyword was not found before
*        the end of the FitsChan was reached (no error is reported). 
*        Otherwise, a value of one is returned. 

*  Notes:
*     -  If a NULL pointer is supplied for "name" then the comment from
*     the current card is returned.
*     -  The returned value is obtained from the next card refering to 
*     the required keyword, starting the search with the current card.
*     Any cards occuring before the current card are not seached. If
*     the entire contents of the FitsChan must be searched, then ensure
*     the current card is the first card in the FitsChan by clearing the Card
*     attribute. This effectively "rewinds" the FitsChan.
*     -  The current card is updated to become the card following the one 
*     read by this function. If the card read by this function is the
*     last one in the FitsChan, then the current card is left pointing at the
*     "end-of-file".
*     -  An error will be reported if the keyword name does not conform
*     to FITS requirements.
*     -  A NULL pointer is returned for the comment string if the keyword
*     has no comment.
*     -  Zero is returned as the function value if an error has already 
*     occurred, or if this function should fail for any reason.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     void astFitsSet<X>( AstFitsChan *this, const char *name, <X>type value, 
*                         const char *comment, int overwrite )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan method.

*  Description:
*     This is a family of functions which store values for named keywords
*     within a FitsChan at the current card position. The supplied keyword 
*     value can either over-write an existing keyword value, or can be 
*     inserted as a new header card into the FitsChan.
*
*     The keyword data type is selected by replacing <X> in the function name 
*     by one of the following strings representing the recognised FITS data 
*     types:
*
*     CF - Complex floating point values.
*     CI - Complex integer values.
*     F  - Floating point values.
*     I  - Integer values.
*     L  - Logical (i.e. boolean) values.
*     S  - String values.
*     CN - A "CONTINUE" value, these are treated like string values, but
*          are encoded without an equals sign.
*
*     The data type of the "value" parameter depends on <X> as follows:
*
*     CF - "double *" (a pointer to a 2 element array holding the real and
*          imaginary parts of the complex value).
*     CI - "int *" (a pointer to a 2 element array holding the real and
*          imaginary parts of the complex value).
*     F  - "double".
*     I  - "int".
*     L  - "int".
*     S  - "const char *".
*     CN - "const char *".

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     name
*        A pointer to a 
*        string holding the keyword name. This may be a complete FITS
*        header card, in which case the keyword to use is extracted from 
*        it. No more than 80 characters are read from this string.
*     value
*        The keyword value to store with the named keyword. The data type
*        of this parameter depends on <X> as described above.
*     comment
*        A pointer to a string holding a comment to associated with the 
*        keyword. If a NULL pointer or a blank string is supplied, then
*        any comment included in the string supplied for the "name" parameter 
*        is used instead. If "name" contains no comment, then any existing 
*        comment in the card being over-written is retained, or a NULL
*        pointer is stored if a new card is being inserted.
*     overwrite
*        If non-zero, the new card formed from the supplied keyword name,
*        value and comment string over-writes the current card, and the 
*        current card is incremented to refer to the next card. If zero, the 
*        new card is inserted in front of the current card and the current 
*        card is left unchanged. In either case, if the current card on 
*        entry points to the "end-of-file", the new card is appended to the 
*        end of the list. 

*  Notes:
*     -  To assign a new value for an existing keyword within a FitsChan,
*     first find the card describing the keyword using astFindFits, and
*     then use one of the astFitsSet<X> family to over-write the old value.
*     -  If, on exit, there are no cards following the card written by
*     this function, then the current card is left pointing at the 
*     "end-of-file".
*     -  An error will be reported if the keyword name does not conform
*     to FITS requirements.

*     list.

*  Parameters:
*     card
*        The current card.
*     next
*        If non-zero, a pointer to the "next" card is returned. Otherwise
*        a pointer to the "previous" card is returned.

/*
*  Name:

*  Purpose:
*     Read the next item of data from a data source.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     void GetNextData( AstChannel *this, int skip, char **name, char **val )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function (over-rides the protected
*     astGetNextData method inherited from the Channel class).

*  Description:
*     This function reads the next item of input data from a data
*     source associated with a FitsChan and returns the result.  It
*     decodes the data item and returns name/value pairs ready for
*     use.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     skip
*        A non-zero value indicates that a new Object is to be read,
*        and that all input data up to the next "Begin" item are to be
*        skipped in order to locate it. This is useful if the data
*        source contains AST objects interspersed with other data (but
*        note that these other data cannot appear inside AST Objects,
*        only between them).
*
*        A zero value indicates that all input data are significant
*        and the next item will therefore be read and an attempt made
*        to interpret it whatever it contains. Any other data
*        inter-mixed with AST Objects will then result in an error.
*     name
*        An address at which to store a pointer to a null-terminated
*        dynamically allocated string containing the name of the next
*        item in the input data stream. This name will be in lower
*        case with no surrounding white space.  It is the callers
*        responsibilty to free the memory holding this string (using
*        astFree) when it is no longer required.
*
*        A NULL pointer value will be returned (without error) to
*        indicate when there are no further input data items to be
*        read.
*     val
*        An address at which to store a pointer to a null-terminated
*        dynamically allocated string containing the value associated
*        with the next item in the input data stream. No case
*        conversion is performed on this string and all white space is
*        potentially significant.  It is the callers responsibilty to
*        free the memory holding this string (using astFree) when it
*        is no longer required.
*
*        The returned pointer will be NULL if an Object data item is
*        read (see the "Data Representation" section).

*  Data Representation:
*     The returned data items fall into the following categories:
*
*     - Begin: Identified by the name string "begin", this indicates
*     the start of an Object definition. The associated value string
*     gives the class name of the Object being defined.
*
*     - IsA: Identified by the name string "isa", this indicates the
*     end of the data associated with a particular class structure
*     within the definiton of a larger Object. The associated value
*     string gives the name of the class whose data have just been
*     read.
*
*     - End: Identified by the name string "end", this indicates the
*     end of the data associated with a complete Object
*     definition. The associated value string gives the class name of
*     the Object whose definition is being ended.
*
*     - Non-Object: Identified by any other name string plus a
*     non-NULL "val" pointer, this gives the value of a non-Object
*     structure component (instance variable). The name identifies
*     which instance variable it is (within the context of the class
*     whose data are being read) and the value is encoded as a string.
*
*     - Object: Identified by any other name string plus a NULL "val"
*     pointer, this identifies the value of an Object structure
*     component (instance variable).  The name identifies which
*     instance variable it is (within the context of the class whose
*     data are being read) and the value is given by subsequent data
*     items (so the next item should be a "Begin" item).

*  Notes:
*     - NULL pointer values will be returned if this function is
*     invoked with the global error status set, or if it should fail
*     for any reason.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and 
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function copies the WCS information stored in the supplied 
*     FitsStore into the supplied FitsChan, using FITS-IRAF encoding.
*
*     IRAF encoding is like FITS-WCS encoding but with the following
*     restrictions:
*
*     1) The celestial projection must not have any projection parameters
*     which are not set to their default values. The one exception to this 
*     is that SIN projections are acceptable if the associated projection 
*     parameter PV<axlat>_1 is zero and PV<axlat>_2 = cot( reference point 
*     latitude). This is encoded using the string "-NCP". The SFL projection 
*     is encoded using the string "-GLS". Note, the original IRAF WCS
*     system only recognised a small subset of the currently available
*     projections, but some more recent IRAF-like software recognizes some 
*     of the new projections included in the FITS-WCS encoding.
*
*     2) The celestial axes must be RA/DEC, galactic or ecliptic.   
*
*     3) LONPOLE and LATPOLE cannot be used. 
*
*     4) Only primary axis descriptions are written out.
*
*     5) RADECSYS is used in place of RADESYS.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore.
*     axlon 
*        Index of celestial longitude axis (-1 if there is no celestial
*        longitude axis).
*     axlat
*        Index of celestial latitude axis (-1 if there is no celestial
*        longitude axis).
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class 
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     A value of 1 is returned if succesfull, and zero is returned
*     otherwise.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     This function checks to see if the supplied Mapping is linear,
*     except for an optional shift of origin. A least squares linear fit 
*     is done to the Mapping. If the mean squared residual in this fit is 
*     less than the suplied value of maxerr, then the fit is accepted. 
*     Otherwise, zero is returned.

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        A pointer to the Mapping to be checked. The Mapping must have
*        equal numbers of input and output coordinates.
*     ndim
*        The number of input and output coordinates for the Mapping.
*     dim
*        The dimensions of the array grid. If not known, supply AST__BAD.
*     matrix
*        A pointer to an array of ndim**2 elements to receive the matrix.
*        The elements are stored row by row. If the Mapping is not linear
*        the supplied values are left unchanged.
*     maxerr
*        For two positions in the output coordinate system of the Mapping
*        to be considered equal, the square of the distance between them
*        must not be greater than "maxerr".

*  Returned Value:
*     Zero if the Mapping is not linear, and one otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  A value of zero is returned if an error has already occurred,
*     or if an error occurs within this function.

*                int *nfld, const char *method, const char *class )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     All characters in the template other than "%" (and the field width
*     and type specifiers which follow a "%") must be matched by an 
*     identical character (ignoring case) in the test string. If a "%" occurs 
*     in the template, then the next character in the template should be a
*     single digit specifying a field width. If it is zero, then the test 
*     string may contain zero or more matching characters. Otherwise,
*     the test string must contain exactly the specified number of matching 
*     characters (i.e. 1 to 9). The field width digit may be omitted, in 
*     which case the test string must contain one or more matching 
*     characters. The next character in the template specifies the type of 
*     matching characters and must be one of "d", "c" or "f". Decimal digits 
*     are matched by "d", all upper (but not lower) case alphabetical 
*     characters are matched by "c", and all characters which are legal within 
*     a FITS keyword (i.e. upper case letters, digits, underscores and 
*     hyphens) are matched by "f".

*  Parameters:
*     test
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the keyword name to
*        be tested.
*     temp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the template.
*     maxfld
*        The maximum number of integer field values which should be
*        returned in "fields".
*     fields
*        A pointer to an array of at least "maxfld" integers. This is
*        returned holding the values of any integer fields specified
*        in the template. The values are extracted from the test string,
*        and stored in the order they appear in the template string.
*     nfld
*        Pointer to a location at which is returned the total number of 
*        integer fields in the test string. This may be more than the 
*        number returned in "fields" if "maxfld" is smaller than "*nfld".
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class 
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     Zero is returned if the test string does not match the template
*     string, and one is returned if it does.

*     test

*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the template.

*        the first field in the template string was a literal character (i.e. 
*        did not start with a "%").
*     extend
*        Pointer to a location at which to return a flag which will be non-zero 
*        if the further test characters could be matched by the first field in 
*        the template. This will be the case if the template field only 
*        specifies a minimum number of matching characters (i.e. if the field 
*        width can be extended). For instance, "%d" can be extended, but "%1d" 
*        cannot.
*     ntest
*        Pointer to a location at which to return the number of characters 
*        matched in the test string. This will be the minimum number allowed

*     ntemp
*        Pointer to a location at which to return the number of characters 
*        read from the template string (i.e. the number of characters in the 
*        field specification).
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.

*        Pointer to the start of the whole template string, for use in error
*        messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     Zero is returned if the test string starts with fewer than the 
*     minimum number of characters matching the template string, and one 
*     is returned if it does.

*  Notes:
*     -  Zero is returned if an error has already occurred, or if this

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     The supplied keyword name, data type and value, and comment are
*     stored in a new FitsCard structure, and this structure is
*     inserted into the circular linked list stored in the supplied
*     FitsChan. It is inserted in front of the current card.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan containing the list of cards.
*     name
*        Pointer to a string holding the keyword name of the new card.
*     type
*        An integer value representing the data type of the keyword.
*     data
*        Pointer to the data associated with the keyword. 
*     comment
*        Pointer to a null-terminated string holding a comment. 
*     flags
*        The flags to assign to the card.

*  Notes:
*     -  The new card is inserted into the list in front of the current card,
*     so that the "next" link from the new card points to the current card. 
*     If the FitsChan is currently at end-of-file (indicated by a NULL
*     pointer being stored for the current card), then the card is appended
*     to the end of the list. The pointer to the current card is left 
*     unchanged.
*     -  Keyword names are converted to upper case before being stored.
*     -  Any trailing white space in a string value is saved as supplied.
*     -  Logical values are converted to zero or one before being stored.
*     -  The "comment" and/or "data" pointers may be supplied as NULL.

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and 
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function copies the WCS information stored in the supplied 
*     FitsStore into the supplied FitsChan, using FITS-PC encoding.
*
*     Zero is returned if the primary axis descriptions cannot be produced.
*     Whether or not secondary axis descriptions can be produced does not
*     effect the returned value (i.e. failure to produce a specific set of 
*     secondary axes does not prevent other axis descriptions from being
*     produced).

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore.
*     axlon 
*        Index of celestial longitude axis (-1 if there is no celestial
*        longitude axis).
*     axlat
*        Index of celestial latitude axis (-1 if there is no celestial
*        longitude axis).
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class 
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     A value of 1 is returned if succesfull, and zero is returned
*     otherwise.

*  Name:
*     PreQuote

*  Type:

*     void PreQuote( const char *value,
*                    char string[ FITSCARDLEN - FITSNAMLEN - 3 ] )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     This function processes a string value in such a way that it can
*     be stored as a FITS character value (associated with a keyword)
*     and later retrieved unchanged, except for possible truncation.
*
*     This pre-processing is necessary because FITS does not regard
*     trailing white space as significant, so it is lost. This
*     function adds double quote (") characters around the string if
*     it is necessary in order to prevent this loss. These quotes are
*     also added to zero-length strings and to strings that are
*     already quoted (so that the original quotes are not lost when
*     they are later un-quoted).
*
*     This function will silently truncate any string that is too long
*     to be stored as a FITS character value, but will ensure that the
*     maximum number of characters are retained, taking account of any
*     quoting required.

*  Parameters:
*     value
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        input character data to be quoted. All white space is
*        significant.
*     string
*        A character array into which the result string will be
*        written, with a terminating null. The maximum number of
*        characters from the input string that can be accommodated in
*        this is (FITSCARDLEN - FITSNAMLEN - 4), but this
*        will be reduced if quoting is necessary.

*  Notes:
*     - The UnPreQuote function should be used to reverse the effect
*     of this function on a string (apart from any truncation).

*  Type:

*  Synopsis:

*     AstObject *Read( AstChannel *this_channel ) 

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function (over-rides the astRead method
*     inherited from the Channel class).

*  Description:
*     This function reads an Object from a FitsChan.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Object. This will always be a FrameSet.

*  Notes:
*     -  The pixel Frame is given a title of "Pixel Coordinates", and
*     each axis in the pixel Frame is given a label of the form "Pixel
*     axis <n>", where <n> is the axis index (starting at one).
*     -  The FITS CTYPE keyword values are used to set the labels for any
*     non-celestial axes in the physical coordinate Frames, and the FITS 
*     CUNIT keywords are used to set the corresponding units strings.
*     -  On exit, the pixel Frame is the base Frame, and the physical
*     Frame derived from the primary axis descriptions is the current Frame.
*     -  Extra Frames are added to hold any secondary axis descriptions. All
*     axes within such a Frame refer to the same coordinate version ('A',
*     'B', etc).
*     -  For foreign encodings, the first card in the FitsChan must be 
*     the current card on entry (otherwise a NULL pointer is returned),
*     and the FitsChan is left at end-of-file on exit.
*     -  For the Native encoding, reading commences from the current card 
*     on entry (which need not be the first in the FitsChan), and the 
*     current Card on exit is the first card following the last one read
*     (or end-of-file).

*  Name:
*     SourceWrap

*  Purpose:
*     Wrapper function to invoke a C FitsChan source function.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     static char *SourceWrap( const char *(* source)( void ) )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     This function invokes the source function whose pointer is
*     supplied in order to read the next input line from an external
*     data store. It then returns a pointer to a dynamic string
*     containing a copy of the text that was read.

*  Parameters:
*     source
*        Pointer to a source function, with no parameters, that
*        returns a pointer to a const, null-terminated string
*        containing the text that it read. This is the form of FitsChan
*        source function employed by the C language interface to the
*        AST library.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to a dynamically allocated, null terminated string
*     containing a copy of the text that was read. This string must be
*     freed by the caller (using astFree) when no longer required.
*
*     A NULL pointer will be returned if there is no more input text
*     to read.

*  Notes:
*     - A NULL pointer value will be returned if this function is
*     invoked with the global error status set or if it should fail
*     for any reason.

*  Name:
*     SpecTrans

*  Purpose:
*     Translated non-standard WCS FITS headers into equivalent standard
*     ones.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     AstFitsChan *SpecTrans( AstFitsChan *this, int encoding, 
*                             const char *method, const char *class )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     This function checks the supplied FitsChan for selected
*     non-standard WCS keywords and, if found, stores equivalent 
*     standard keywords in a newly created FitsChan which is returned as
*     the function value. All the original keywords are marked
*     as having been used, so that they are not written out when the 
*     FitsChan is deleted. 
*
*     At the moment, the non-standard keywords checked for are:
*
*     1) RADECSYS is renamed as RADESYS
*
*     2) LONGPOLE is renamed as LONPOLE
*
*     3) CDjjjiii is renamed as CDj_i
*
*     4) PCjjjiii, CDELTj and CROTAj are converted to CDj_i
*
*     5) PROJPi are converted to PV<axlat>_i
*   
*     6) CmVALi are converted to CRVALis (s=A,B,,, for m=1,2...). This
*        is also done for CmPIXi, CmYPEi, and CmNITi. CmELTi is converted
*        to a CDj_is array.
*
*     7) EQUINOX keywords with string values equal to a date preceeded
*        by the leter B or J (eg "B1995.0"). These are converted to the
*        corresponding Julian floating point value without any epoch
*        specifier.
*
*     8) EPOCH values are converted into Julian EQUINOX values (but only
*        if the FitsChan does not already contain an EQUINOX value).
*
*     9) DATE-OBS values are converted into MJD-OBS values (but only
*        if the FitsChan does not already contain an MJD-OBS value).
*
*     10) EQUINOX or EPOCH keywords with value zero  are converted to 
*         B1950. 
*     
*     11) The AIPS NCP projection is converted into an equivalent SIN
*         projection.
*
*     12) The IRAF "ZPX" projection. If the last 4 chacaters of CTYPEi 
*       (i = 1, naxis) are "-ZPX", then:
*	- "ZPX" is replaced by "ZPN" within the CTYPEi value
*       - If the FitsChan contains no PROJP keywords, then projection
*       parameter valus are read from any WATi_nnn keywords, and
*       corresponding PV keywords are added to the FitsChan.
*       - The WATi_nnn keywords may specify corrections to the basic ZPN
*       projection by including "lngcor" or "latcor" terms. There is no
*       direct equivalent in FITS-PC to these terms and so they are
*       ignored (it may be possible to use a pixel correction image but
*       such images are not supported by AST anyway). If these correction
*       terms are found ASTWARN keywords are added to the FitsChan 
*       containing a warning message. The calling application can (if it
*       wants to) check for this keyword, and report its contents to the
*       user.
*
*     13) The IRAF "TNX" projection. If the last 4 chacaters of CTYPEi 
*       (i = 1, naxis) are "-TNX", then:
*	- "TNX" is replaced by "TAN" within the CTYPEi value
*       - If the FitsChan contains no PROJP keywords, then projection
*       parameter valus are read from any WATi_nnn keywords, and
*       corresponding PV keywords are added to the FitsChan.
*       - If the TNX projection cannot be converted exactly into a TAN 
*       projection, ASTWARN keywords are added to the FitsChan 
*       containing a warning message. The calling application can (if it
*       wants to) check for this keyword, and report its contents to the
*       user.
*
*     14) Keywords relating to the IRAF "mini-WCS" system are removed.
*       This is the IRAF equivalent of the AST native encoding. Mini-WCS
*       keywords are removed in order to avoid confusion arising between
*       potentially inconsistent encodings.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     encoding
*        The FitsChan encoding in use.
*     method
*        Pointer to string holding name of calling method.
*     class 
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new FitsChan containing the keywords which
*     constitute the standard equivalents to any non-standard keywords in 
*     the supplied FitsChan. A NULL pointer is returned if there are no
*     non-standard keywords in the supplied FitsChan.

*+
*  Name:
*     astSplit

*  Purpose:
*     Extract the keyword name, value and comment from a FITS header card.

*  Type:
*     Protected function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "fitschan.h"
*     int astSplit( const char *card, char **name, char **value, 
*                   char **comment, const char *method, const char *class  )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     The name, value and comment (if present) are extracted from the
*     supplied card text and returned.

*  Parameters:
*     card
*        Pointer to a string holding the FITS header card.
*     name
*        Pointer to a location at which to return the pointer to a string 
*        holding the keyword name.
*     value
*        Pointer to a location at which to return the pointer to a string 
*        holding the keyword value. 
*     comment
*        Pointer to a location at which to return the pointer to a string 
*        holding the keyword comment.
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class 
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned value:
*     -  An integer identifying the data type of the keyword value. This
*     will be one of the values AST__COMMENT, AST__INT, AST__STRING, 
*     AST__CONTINUE, AST__FLOAT, AST__COMPLEXI or AST__COMPLEXF defined in 
*     fitschan.h.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the keyword value is a string, then the returned value does not
*     include the delimiting quotes, and pairs of adjacent quotes within the
*     string are replaced by single quotes.
*     -  A maximum of 80 characters are read from the supplied card, so the
*     string does not need to be null terminated unless less than 80 
*     characters are to be read.
*     -  The memory holding the three strings "name", "value" and "comment" 
*     should be released when no longer needed using astFree.
*     -  NULL pointers and a data type of AST__COMMENT are returned if an 
*     error has already occurred, or if this function fails for any reason.

*  Name:
*     SplitMap

*  Purpose:
*     Locate a WCS projection within a Mapping.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     int SplitMap( AstMapping *map, int invert, AstMapping **map1, 
*                   AstMapping **map2, AstMapping **map3 )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     If possible, the supplied Mapping is decomposed into three component 
*     mappings to be compounded in series. To be acceptable, the second of 
*     these three Mappings must be an inverted WcsMap, and there must not
*     be a WcsMap in either of the other two Mappings. If it is not
*     possible to produce such a group of three Mappings, then a zero
*     function value is returned, together with three NULL Mapping
*     pointers. All the mappings before the WcsMap are compounded
*     together and returned as "map1". The inverse of the WcsMap itself is 
*     returned as "map2", and any remaining Mappings are compounded together 
*     and returned as "map3".
*
*     The search algorithm allows for an arbitrary combination of series and
*     parallel CmpMaps.

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        A pointer to the Mapping from pixel to physical coordinates.
*     invert
*        The value of the Invert attribute to use with "map" (the value 
*        returned by astGetInvert is not used).
*     map1
*        A location at which to return a pointer to the Mapping from pixel 
*        to relative physical coordinates. 
*     map2
*        A location at which to return a pointer to the Mapping from relative 
*        physical coordinates to native spherical coordinates. This will
*        be an inverted WcsMap.
*     map3
*        A location at which to return a pointer to the Mapping from 
*        native spherical coordinates to physical coordinates. 
*     dep 
*        The address of an integer holding the current depth of recursion
*        into this function.

*  Returned Value:
*     One if a WcsMap was found, zero otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  The returned Mappings contain independant copies of the relevant
*     components of the supplied Mapping and can be modified without
*     changing the supplied Mapping.
*     -  NULL pointers will be returned for all Mappings if no WcsMap 
*     can be found in the supplied Mapping. 
*     -  A pointer to a UnitMap will be returned for map1 if no mappings
*     exist before the WcsMap.
*     -  A pointer to a UnitMap will be returned for map3 if no mappings
*     exist after the WcsMap.
*     -  NULL pointers will be returned for all Mappings and a function
*     value of zero will be returned if an error has occurred, or if this 
*     function should fail for any reason.

*        The number of axes.
*     matrix
*        A pointer to an array of naxis*naxis elements. On entry this holds

*  Name:
*     WcsAddRef

*  Purpose:
*     Create a WinMap which converts non-celestial axes into absolute
*     physical coordinates.

*  Type:

*  Synopsis:
*     AstWinMap *WcsAddRef( FitsStore *store, int noncel, char s,

*                           const char *class   )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     A WinMap is created which implements a shift of origin by adding
*     the reference absolute physical coordinates (CRVALi) onto the input 
*     relative physical coordinates. The Mapping only applies to the
*     non-celestial axes. It is assumed that the longitude and latitude
*     axes, if present, will have been shuffled down to axes 0 and 1
*     respectively. The returned Mapping only applies to the remaining
*     axes.

*  Parameters:
*     store
*        A structure containing values for FITS keywords relating to 
*        the World Coordinate System.
*     noncel
*        The number of non-celestial axes.
*     s
*        Co-ordinate version character to use (space means primary axes).
*     outperm
*        Pointer to an array describing the correspondance between
*        axes in the returned Mapping and the crval values stored
*        in "store". Axis "i" of the Mapping will have reference value
*        crval[ outperm[ 2 + i ] ]. outperm[ 0 ] gives the index of the 
*        longitude axis in "store", and outperm[ 1 ] gives the index of 
*        the latitude axis in "store". 
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class 
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the created WinMap or a NULL pointer if an 
*     error occurred.

*  Notes:
*     -  If there are no celestial axes then outperm is ignored, and it
*     is assumed that the reference value for axis "i" is in crval[ i ].
*     -  If an error occurs, a NULL pointer is returned.

/*
*  Name:
*     WcsFrame

*  Purpose:
*     Create a Frame to describe a WCS physical coordinate system.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     AstFrame *WcsFrame( AstFitsChan this, FitsStore *store, char s, int prj,
*                         char *sys, int axlon, int axlat, const char *method, 
*                         const char *class )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan member function.

*  Description:
*     A Frame is returned describing the physical coordinate system of
*     a WCS system. This will be a SkyFrame if the physical
*     coordinate system consists of a pair of celestial
*     longitude and latitude axes.  If there are any other axes, then a
*     CmpFrame will be returned holding a SkyFrame for the celestial
*     axes, and a simple Frame for the other axes. If there are no
*     celestial axes in the FitsChan, then a simple Frame will 
*     be returned.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The FitsChan from which the keywords were read. Warning messages
*        may be added to this FitsChan.
*     store
*        A structure containing values for FITS keywords relating to 
*        the World Coordinate System.
*     s
*        A character identifying the co-ordinate version to use. A space 
*        means use primary axis descriptions. Otherwise, it must be an 
*        upper-case alphabetical characters ('A' to 'Z').
*     prj
*        An integer code for the WCS projection being used.
*     sys
*        A pointer to a string identifying the celestial co-ordinate system 
*        implied by the CTYPE values in the FitsStore. This will be "EQU" (for
*        equatorial), or a one or two character code extracted from the
*        CTYPE values.
*     axlon 
*        Zero based index of the longitude axis in the FITS header.
*     axlat
*        Zero based index of the latitude axis in the FITS header.
*     method
*        The calling method. Used only in error messages.
*     class 
*        The object class. Used only in error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the Frame.

*  Notes:
*     -  The FITS CTYPE keyword values are used to set the labels for any
*     non-celestial axes in the returned Frame, and the FITS CUNIT keywords 
*     are used to set the corresponding units strings.
*     -  A NULL pointer is returned if an error has already occurred, or
*     if this function should fail for any reason.

*  Name:
*     WCSFromStore

*  Purpose:
*     Store WCS keywords in a FitsChan using FITS-WCS encoding.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     int WCSFromStore( AstFitsChan *this, FitsStore *store, 
*                       int axlat, int axlon, const char *method, 
*                       const char *class )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     A FitsStore is a structure containing a generalised represention of
*     a FITS WCS FrameSet. Functions exist to convert a FitsStore to and
*     from a set of FITS header cards (using a specified encoding), or
*     an AST FrameSet. In other words, a FitsStore is an encoding-
*     independant intermediary staging post between a FITS header and 
*     an AST FrameSet.
*
*     This function copies the WCS information stored in the supplied 
*     FitsStore into the supplied FitsChan, using FITS-WCS encoding.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the FitsChan.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore.
*     axlon 
*        Index of celestial longitude axis (-1 if there is no celestial
*        longitude axis).
*     axlat
*        Index of celestial latitude axis (-1 if there is no celestial
*        longitude axis).
*     method
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.
*     class 
*        Pointer to a string holding the name of the supplied object class.
*        This is only for use in constructing error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     A value of 1 is returned if succesfull, and zero is returned
*     otherwise.

*  Description:
*     A CmpMap is created which rotates the supplied Native Spherical Coords
*     into Celestial Coords in the standard system specified by the CTYPE 
*     keywords. The reference values are added on to any non-celestial axes 
*     to produce absolute physical coordinates.
*
*     At the highest level, the returned CmpMap is made up of the following 
*     Mappings in series (if celestial long/lat axes are present):
*        1 - A PermMap which rearranges the axes so that the longitude axis is
*            axis 0, the latitude axis is axis 1, and all other axes are
*            stored at higher indices, starting at axis 2.
*        2 - A CmpMap which converts the values on axes 0 and 1 from Native
*            Spherical to Celestial coordinates, leaving all other axes 
*            unchanged.
*        3 - A PermMap which rearranges the axes to put the longitude and 
*            latitude axes back in their original places. This is just the 
*            inverse of the PermMap used at stage 1 above.
*
*     The CmpMap used at stage 2 above, is made up of two Mappings in 
*     parallel:
*         4 - A CmpMap which maps axes 0 and 1 from Native Spherical to
*             Celestial coordinates.
*         5 - A WinMap which adds on the reference values to axes 2, 3, etc.
*
*     The CmpMap used at stage 4 above, is made up of the following Mappings
*     in series:
*         6 - A SphMap which converts the supplied spherical coordinates into
*             Cartesian Coordinates.
*         7 - A MatrixMap which rotates the Cartesian coordinates from the 
*             Native to the Celestial system.
*         8 - A SphMap which converts the resulting Cartesian coordinates back
*             to spherical coordinates.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The FitsChan.
*     store
*        A structure containing values for FITS keywords relating to 
*        the World Coordinate System.
*     s
*        Co-ordinate version character to use (space means primary axes).
*     wcsmap 
*        A mapping describing the deprojection which is being used. This is 
*        needed in order to be able to locate the reference point within the
*        Native Speherical Coordinate system, since it varies from projection
*        to projection.
*     method
*        A pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     class
*        A pointer to a string holding the class of the object being
*        read. This is used only in the construction of error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the created CmpMap or a NULL pointer if an error occurred.

/*
*  Name:
*     WcsNatPole

*  Purpose:
*     Find the position of the north pole of the Native Spherical
*     Coordinate system.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     int WcsNatPole( AstFitsChan *this, AstWcsMap *wcsmap, double alpha0, 
*                     double delta0, double latpole, double *phip, 
*                     double *alphap, double *deltap )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan

*  Description:
*     The supplied WcsMap converts projected positions given in
*     "Relative Physical Coords" to positions in the "Native Spherical 
*     Coordinate" system. This function finds the pole of this spherical
*     coordinate system in terms of the standard Celestial Coordinate 
*     system to which the CRVALi, LONPOLE and LATPOLE keywords refer (this
*     system should be identified by the last 4 characters of the CTYPEi 
*     keywords). It also supplies a default value for LONPOLE if no value
*     has been supplied explicitly in the FITS header.
*
*     This function implements equations 8, 9 and 10 from the WCS paper by
*     Calabretta & Greisen (plus the associated treatment of special cases).
*     The paper provides more detailed documentation for the mathematics
*     implemented by this function.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        The FitsChan in which to store any warning cards.
*     wcsmap 
*        A mapping describing the deprojection being used (i.e. the
*        mapping from Relative Physical Coords to Native Spherical Coords).
*     alpha0
*        The longitude of the reference point in the standard celestial
*        coordinate frame (in radians). 
*     delta0
*        The latitude of the reference point in the standard celestial
*        coordinate frame (in radians).
*     latpole
*        The value of FITS keyword LATPOLE, converted to radians, or the 
*        symbolic constant AST__BAD if the keyword was not supplied. 
*     phip
*        Pointer to a location at which is stored the longitude of the north
*        pole of the standard Celestial coordinate system, as measured in
*        the Native Spherical Coordinate system, in radians. This should be
*        supplied holding the radian equivalent of the value of the FITS 
*        keyword LONPOLE, or the symbolic constant AST__BAD if the keyword was 
*        not supplied (in which case a default value will be returned at the
*        given location).
*     alphap
*        Pointer to a location at which to store the calculated longitude
*        of the Native North Pole, in radians.
*     deltap
*        Pointer to a location at which to store the calculated latitude
*        of the Native North Pole, in radians.
*     class
*        A pointer to a string holding the class of the object being
*        read. This is used only in the construction of error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     A status: non-zero for success, zero if the position of the native 
*     north pole is undefined.

*  Notes:
*     -  Certain combinations of keyword values result in the latitude of
*     the Native North Pole being undefined. In these cases, a value of 
*     0 is returned for the function value, but no error is reported.
*     -  All angular values used by this function are in radians.
*     -  A value of 0 is returned if an error has already occurred.

*        Pointer to the Mapping from pixel coordinates to physical
*        coordinates. This Mapping should have equal numbers of input and
*        output coordinates.
*     phyfrm
*        Pointer to physical coordinate Frame.
*     naxis
*        The number of input and output coordinates for "map".
*     pixref
*        Pointer to an array holding the pixel coordinates of the
*        reference point. If these are not known, a NULL pointer can be
*        supplied in which case the reference position is put at the
*        centre of the image (if the image dimensions are stored in the
*        FitsChan), or at the origin of pixel coordinates.
*     store
*        Pointer to the FitsStore structure holding the values to use for 
*        the WCS keywords. 
*     dim 
*        Pointer to an array of pixel axis dimensions. Individual elements 
*        may be AST__BAD if dimensions are not known.
*     s
*        A character identifying the co-ordinate version to use. A space 
*        means use primary axis descriptions. Otherwise, it must be an 
*        upper-case alphabetical characters ('A' to 'Z').
*     method
*        A pointer to a string holding the name of the calling method.
*        This is used only in the construction of error messages.
*     class
*        A pointer to a string holding the class of the object being
*        read. This is used only in the construction of error messages.

*  Returned Value:
*     One if the Mapping could be described by FITS-WCS, zero otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     -  Values which would take the correct default value if omitted
*     from the FITS header are given a bad value in "store".

/*
*att++
*  Name:
*     Encoding

*  Purpose:
*     System for encoding Objects as FITS headers.

*  Type:
*     Public attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     String.

*  Description:
*     This attribute specifies the encoding system to use when AST
*     Objects are stored as FITS header cards in a FitsChan. It
c     affects the behaviour of the astWrite and astRead functions when
f     affects the behaviour of the AST_WRITE and AST_READ routines when
*     they are used to transfer any AST Object to or from an external
*     representation consisting of FITS header cards (i.e. whenever a
*     write or read operation is performed using a FitsChan as the I/O
*     Channel).
*
*     There are several ways (conventions) by which coordinate system
*     information may be represented in the form of FITS headers and
*     the Encoding attribute is used to specify which of these should
*     be used. The encoding options available are outlined in the
*     "Encodings Available" section below, and in more detail in the
*     sections which follow.
*
*     Encoding systems differ in the range of possible Objects
*     (e.g. classes) they can represent, in the restrictions they
*     place on these Objects (e.g. compatibility with some
*     externally-defined coordinate system model) and in the number of
*     Objects that can be stored together in any particular set of
*     FITS header cards (e.g. multiple Objects, or only a single
*     Object). The choice of encoding also affects the range of
*     external applications which can potentially read and interpret
*     the FITS header cards produced.
*
*     The encoding options available are not necessarily mutually
*     exclusive, and it may sometimes be possible to store multiple
*     Objects (or the same Object several times) using different
*     encodings within the same set of FITS header cards. This
*     possibility increases the likelihood of other applications being
*     able to read and interpret the information.
*
*     By default, a FitsChan will attempt to determine which encoding
*     system is already in use, and will set the default Encoding
*     value accordingly (so that subsequent I/O operations adopt the
*     same conventions). It does this by looking for certain critical
*     FITS keywords which only occur in particular encodings. For
*     details of how this works, see the "Choice of Default Encoding"
*     section below. If you wish to ensure that a particular encoding
*     system is used, independently of any FITS cards already present,
*     you should set an explicit Encoding value yourself.

*  Encodings Available:
*     The Encoding attribute can take any of the following (case
*     insensitive) string values to select the corresponding encoding
*     system:
*
*     - "DSS": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS header
*     cards using the convention developed at the Space Telescope
*     Science Institute (STScI) for the Digitised Sky Survey (DSS)
*     astrometric plate calibrations. The main advantages of this
*     encoding are that FITS images which use it are widely available
*     and it is understood by a number of important and
*     well-established astronomy applications. For further details,
*     see the section "The DSS Encoding" below.
*
*     - "FITS-WCS": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS
*     header cards using the conventions described in the (draft) FITS
*     world coordinate system (FITS-WCS) paper by E.W. Greisen and
*     M. Calabretta (A & A, in preparation). The main advantages of
*     this encoding are that it should be understood by any FITS-WCS
*     compliant application and is likely to be adopted widely for
*     FITS data in future. At present, however, it suffers from the
*     disadvantage that the FITS-WCS standard is only a draft (and is
*     not stable), so it cannot yet be recommended for regular
*     use. For further details, see the section "The FITS-WCS
*     Encoding" below.
*
*     - "FITS-PC": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS
*     header cards using the conventions described in an earlier draft
*     of the FITS world coordinate system paper by E.W. Greisen and
*     M. Calabretta. This encoding uses a combination of CDELTi and
*     PCiiijjj keywords to describe the scale and rotation of the pixel
*     axes. This encoding is included to support existing data and  
*     software which uses these now superceded conventions. In general,
*     the "FITS-WCS" encoding (which uses CDi_j keywords to describe the
*     scale and rotation) should be used in preference to "FITS-PC".
*
*     - "FITS-IRAF": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS
*     header cards using the conventions described in the document
*     "World Coordinate Systems Representations Within the FITS
*     Format" by R.J. Hanisch and D.G. Wells, 1988.  This encoding is
*     currently employed by the IRAF data analysis facility, so its
*     use will facilitate data exchange with IRAF. Its main advantages
*     are that it is a stable convention which approximates to a
*     subset of the propsed FITS-WCS encoding (above). This makes it
*     suitable as an interim method for storing coordinate system
*     information in FITS headers until the FITS-WCS encoding becomes
*     stable. Since many datasets currently use the FITS-IRAF
*     encoding, conversion of data from FITS-IRAF to the final form of
*     FITS-WCS is likely to be well supported.
*
*     - "FITS-AIPS": Encodes coordinate system information in FITS
*     header cards using the conventions originally introduced by the 
*     AIPS data analysis facility. This is base on the use of CDELTi and
*     CROTAi keuwords to desribe the scale and rotation of each axis.
*     These conventions have been superceded but are still widely used.
*
*     - "NATIVE": Encodes AST Objects in FITS header cards using a
*     convention which is private to the AST library (but adheres to
*     the general FITS standard) and which uses FITS keywords that
*     will not clash with other encoding systems. The main advantages
*     of this are that any class of AST Object may be encoded, and any
*     (reasonable) number of Objects may be stored sequentially in the
*     same FITS header. This makes FITS headers an almost loss-less
*     communication path for passing AST Objects between applications
*     (although all such applications must, of course, make use of the
*     AST library to interpret the information). For further details,
*     see the section "The NATIVE Encoding" below.

*  Choice of Default Encoding:
*     If the Encoding attribute of a FitsChan is not set, the default
*     value it takes is determined by the presence of certain critical
*     FITS keywords within the FitsChan. The sequence of decisions
*     used to arrive at the default value is as follows:
*
*     - If the FitsChan contains any keywords beginning with the
*     string "BEGAST", then NATIVE encoding is used,
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
*     "PCiiijjj", where "i" and "j" are single digits, then
*     FITS-PC encoding is used,
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
*     "CDiiijjj", where "i" and "j" are single digits, then
*     FITS-IRAF encoding is used,
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
*     "CDi_j", and at least one of RADECSYS, PROJPi, or CjVALi
*     where "i" and "j" are single digits, then FITS-IRAF encoding is 
*     used.
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains any keywords of the form
*     PROJPi, CjVALi or RADECSYS, where "i" and "j" are single digits, 
*     then FITS-PC encoding is used.
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
*     CROTAi, where "i" is a single digit, then FITS-AIPS encoding is 
*     used.
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
*     CDELTi, where "i" is a single digit, then FITS-PC encoding is 
*     used.
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains a keyword of the form
*     CRVALi, where "i" is a single digit, then FITS-WCS encoding is 
*     used.
*     - Otherwise, if the FitsChan contains the "PLTRAH" keyword, then
*     DSS encoding is used,
*     - Otherwise, if none of these conditions is met (as would be the
*     case when using an empty FitsChan), then NATIVE encoding is
*     used.
*
*     Setting an explicit value for the Encoding attribute always
*     over-rides this default behaviour.
*
*     Note that when writing information to a FitsChan, the choice of
*     encoding will depend greatly on the type of application you
*     expect to be reading the information in future. If you do not
*     know this, there may sometimes be an advantage in writing the
*     information several times, using a different encoding on each
*     occasion.

*  The DSS Encoding:
*     The DSS encoding uses FITS header cards to store a multi-term
*     polynomial which relates pixel positions on a digitised
*     photographic plate to celestial coordinates (right ascension and
*     declination). This encoding may only be used to store a single
*     AST Object in any set of FITS header cards, and that Object must
*     be a FrameSet which conforms to the STScI/DSS coordinate system
*     model (this means the Mapping which relates its base and current 
*     Frames must include either a DssMap or a WcsMap with type 
*     AST__TAN).
*
c     When reading a DSS encoded Object (using astRead), the FitsChan
f     When reading a DSS encoded Object (using AST_READ), the FitsChan
*     concerned must initially be positioned at the first card (its
*     Card attribute must equal 1) and the result of the read, if
*     successful, will always be a pointer to a FrameSet. The base
*     Frame of this FrameSet represents DSS pixel coordinates, and the
*     current Frame represents DSS celestial coordinates. Such a read
*     is always destructive and causes the FITS header cards required
*     for the construction of the FrameSet to be removed from the
*     FitsChan, which is then left positioned at the "end-of-file". A
*     subsequent read using the same encoding will therefore not
*     return another FrameSet, even if the FitsChan is rewound.
*
c     When astWrite is used to store a FrameSet using DSS encoding,
f     When AST_WRITE is used to store a FrameSet using DSS encoding,
*     an attempt is first made to simplify the FrameSet to see if it
*     conforms to the DSS model.  Specifically, the current Frame must 
*     be a default FK5 SkyFrame; the projection must be a tangent plane 
*     (gnomonic) projection with polynomial corrections conforming to 
*     DSS requirements, and north must be parallel to the second base
*     Frame axis.
*
*     If the simplification process succeeds, a description of the
*     FrameSet is written to the FitsChan using appropriate DSS FITS
*     header cards. The base Frame of the FrameSet is used to form the
*     DSS pixel coordinate system and the current Frame gives the DSS
*     celestial coordinate system.  A successful write operation will
*     over-write any existing DSS encoded data in the FitsChan, but
*     will not affect other (non-DSS) header cards. If a destructive
*     read of a DSS encoded Object has previously occurred, then an
*     attempt will be made to store the FITS header cards back in
*     their original locations.
*
*     If an attempt to simplify a FrameSet to conform to the DSS model
*     fails (or if the Object supplied is not a FrameSet), then no
c     data will be written to the FitsChan and astWrite will return
f     data will be written to the FitsChan and AST_WRITE will return
*     zero. No error will result.

*  The FITS-WCS Encoding:
*     The FITS-WCS convention uses FITS header cards to describe the
*     relationship between pixels in an image (not necessarily
*     2-dimensional) and one or more related "world coordinate systems".
*     Often, although not necessarily, one of these systems will be a 
*     celestial coordinate system, in which case the sequence of 
*     transformations which convert between the various intermediate 
*     coordinate systems will include a "sky projection" (e.g. as
*     implemented by a WcsMap).  The FITS-WCS encoding may only be
*     used to store a single AST Object in any set of FITS header
*     cards, and that Object must be a FrameSet which conforms to the
*     FITS-WCS model (the FrameSet may, however, contain multiple Frames).
*
c     When reading a FITS-WCS encoded Object (using astRead), the FitsChan
f     When reading a FITS-WCS encoded Object (using AST_READ), the FitsChan
*     concerned must initially be positioned at the first card (its
*     Card attribute must equal 1) and the result of the read, if
*     successful, will always be a pointer to a FrameSet. The base
*     Frame of this FrameSet represents FITS-WCS pixel coordinates,
*     and the current Frame represents the physical coordinate system
*     described by the FITS-WCS primary axis descriptions. If
*     secondary axis descriptions are also present, then the FrameSet
*     may contain additional (non-current) Frames which represent
*     these.  Such a read is always destructive and causes the FITS
*     header cards required for the construction of the FrameSet to be
*     removed from the FitsChan, which is then left positioned at the
*     "end-of-file". A subsequent read using the same encoding will
*     therefore not return another FrameSet, even if the FitsChan is
*     rewound.
*
c     When astWrite is used to store a FrameSet using FITS-WCS
f     When AST_WRITE is used to store a FrameSet using FITS-WCS
*     encoding, an attempt is first made to simplify the FrameSet to
*     see if it conforms to the FITS-WCS model. If this simplification
*     process succeeds (as it often should, as the model is reasonably
*     flexible), a description of the FrameSet is written to the
*     FitsChan using appropriate FITS header cards. The base Frame of
*     the FrameSet is used to form the FITS-WCS pixel coordinate
*     system and the current Frame gives the physical coordinate
*     system to be described by the FITS-WCS primary axis
*     descriptions.  Any additional Frames in the FrameSet may be used
*     to construct secondary axis descriptions, where appropriate.
*
*     A successful write operation will over-write any existing
*     FITS-WCS encoded data in the FitsChan, but will not affect other
*     (non-FITS-WCS) header cards. If a destructive read of a FITS-WCS
*     encoded Object has previously occurred, then an attempt will be
*     made to store the FITS header cards back in their original
*     locations. Otherwise, the new cards will be inserted following
*     any other FITS-WCS related header cards present or, failing
*     that, in front of the current card (as given by the Card
*     attribute).
*
*     If an attempt to simplify a FrameSet to conform to the FITS-WCS
*     model fails (or if the Object supplied is not a FrameSet), then
c     no data will be written to the FitsChan and astWrite will
f     no data will be written to the FitsChan and AST_WRITE will
*     return zero. No error will result.

*  The FITS-IRAF Encoding:
*     The FITS-IRAF encoding can, for most purposes, be considered as
*     a subset of the FITS-WCS encoding (above), although it differs
*     in the details of the FITS keywords used. It is used in exactly
*     the same way and has the same restrictions, but with the
*     addition of the following:
*
*     - The only celestial coordinate systems that may be represented
*     are equatorial, galactic and ecliptic,
*     - Sky projections can be represented only if any associated
*     projection parameters are set to their default values.
*     - Secondary axis descriptions are not supported, so when writing
*     a FrameSet to a FitsChan, only information from the base and
*     current Frames will be stored.
*
*     Note that this encoding is provided mainly as an interim measure to
*     provide a more stable alternative to the FITS-WCS encoding until the
*     FITS standard for encoding WCS information is finalised.  The name
*     "FITS-IRAF" indicates the general keyword conventions used and does
*     not imply that this encoding will necessarily support all features of
*     the WCS scheme used by IRAF software. Nevertheless, an attempt has
*     been made to support a few such features where they are known to be
*     used by important sources of data.
*
*     When writing a FrameSet using the FITS-IRAF encoding, axis rotations
*     are specified by a matrix of FITS keywords of the form "CDi_j", where
*     "i" and "j" are single digits. The alternative form "CDiiijjj", which
*     is also in use, is recognised when reading an Object, but is never
*     written.
*
*     In addition, the experimental IRAF "ZPX" and "TNX" sky projections will 
*     be accepted when reading, but will never be written (the corresponding
*     FITS "ZPN" or "TAN" projection being used instead). However, there
*     are restrictions on the use of these experimental projections. For
*     "ZPX", longitude and latitude correction surfaces (appearing as
*     "lngcor" or "latcor" terms in the IRAF-specific "WAT" keywords) are
*     not supported. For "TNX" projections, only cubic surfaces encoded as 
*     simple polynomials with "half cross-terms" are supported. If an
*     un-usable "TNX" or "ZPX" projection is encountered while reading 
*     from a FitsChan, a simpler form of TAN or ZPN projection is used
*     which ignores the unsupported features and may therefore be
*     inaccurate. If this happens, a warning message is added to the 
*     contents of the FitsChan as a set of cards using the keyword "ASTWARN".
*
*     You should not normally attempt to mix the FITS-IRAF, FITS-WCS,
*     FITS-AIPS or FITS-PC encodings within the same FitsChan, since there 
*     is a risk that keyword clashes may occur.

*  The FITS-PC Encoding:
*     The FITS-PC encoding can, for most purposes, be considered as
*     equivalent to the FITS-WCS encoding (above), although it differs
*     in the details of the FITS keywords used. It is used in exactly
*     the same way and has the same restrictions.

*  The FITS-AIPS Encoding:
*     The FITS-AIPS encoding can, for most purposes, be considered as
*     equivalent to the FITS-WCS encoding (above), although it differs
*     in the details of the FITS keywords used. It is used in exactly
*     the same way and has the same restrictions, but with the
*     addition of the following:
*
*     - The only celestial coordinate systems that may be represented
*     are equatorial, galactic and ecliptic,
*     - Sky projections can be represented only if any associated
*     projection parameters are set to their default values.
*     - The AIT, SFL and MER projections can only be written if the CRVAL 
*     keywords are zero for both longitude and latitude axes.
*     - Secondary axis descriptions are not supported, so when writing
*     a FrameSet to a FitsChan, only information from the base and
*     current Frames will be stored.
*     - If there are more than 2 axes in the base and current Frames, any 
*     rotation must be restricted to the celestial plane, and must involve 
*     no shear.

*  The NATIVE Encoding:
*     The NATIVE encoding may be used to store a description of any
*     class of AST Object in the form of FITS header cards, and (for
*     most practical purposes) any number of these Object descriptions
*     may be stored within a single set of FITS cards. If multiple
*     Object descriptions are stored, they are written and read
*     sequentially. The NATIVE encoding makes use of unique FITS
*     keywords which are designed not to clash with keywords that have
*     already been used for other purposes (if a potential clash is
*     detected, an alternative keyword is constructed to avoid the
*     clash).
*
*     When reading a NATIVE encoded object from a FitsChan (using
c     astRead), FITS header cards are read, starting at the current
f     AST_READ), FITS header cards are read, starting at the current
*     card (as determined by the Card attribute), until the start of
*     the next Object description is found. This description is then
*     read and converted into an AST Object, for which a pointer is
*     returned. Such a read is always destructive and causes all the
*     FITS header cards involved in the Object description to be
*     removed from the FitsChan, which is left positioned at the
*     following card.
*
*     The Object returned may be of any class, depending on the
*     description that was read, and other AST routines may be used to
*     validate it (for example, by examining its Class or ID attribute
c     using astGetC). If further NATIVE encoded Object descriptions
f     using AST_GETC). If further NATIVE encoded Object descriptions
c     exist in the FitsChan, subsequent calls to astRead will return
f     exist in the FitsChan, subsequent calls to AST_READ will return
*     the Objects they describe in sequence (and destroy their
*     descriptions) until no more remain between the current card and
*     the "end-of-file".
*
c     When astWrite is used to write an Object using NATIVE encoding,
f     When AST_WRITE is used to write an Object using NATIVE encoding,
*     a description of the Object is inserted immediately before the
*     current card (as determined by the Card attribute).  Multiple
*     Object descriptions may be written in this way and are stored
*     separately (and sequentially if the Card attribute is not
*     modified between the writes). A write operation using the NATIVE
*     encoding does not over-write previously written Object
*     descriptions. Note, however, that subsequent behaviour is
*     undefined if an Object description is written inside a
*     previously-written description, so this should be avoided.
*
*     When an Object is written to a FitsChan using NATIVE encoding,
c     astWrite should (barring errors) always transfer data and
f     AST_WRITE should (barring errors) always transfer data and
*     return a value of 1.

*  Applicability:
*     FitsChan
*        All FitsChans have this attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     Integer.

*  Description:
*     This attribute gives the number of significant decimal digits to
*     use when formatting floating point values for inclusion in the
*     FITS header cards within a FitsChan.
*
*     By default, a positive value is used which results in no loss of

*     Usually, this causes no problems.
*
*     However, to adhere strictly to the recommendations of the FITS
*     standard, the width of the formatted value (including sign,
*     decimal point and exponent) ought not to be more than 20
*     characters. If you are concerned about this, you should set
*     FitsDigits to a negative value, such as -15. In this case, the
*     absolute value (+15) indicates the maximum number of significant
*     digits to use, but the actual number used may be fewer than this
*     to ensure that the FITS recommendations are satisfied. When
*     using this approach, the resulting number of significant digits
*     may depend on the value being formatted and on the presence of
*     any sign, decimal point or exponent.
*
*     The value of this attribute is effective when FITS header cards
*     are output, either using

*  Purpose:
*     Create a FitsChan.

*  Type:
*     Public function.

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "fitschan.h"
c     AstFitsChan *astFitsChan( const char *(* source)( void ),
c                               void (* sink)( const char * ),
c                               const char *options, ... )
f     RESULT = AST_FITSCHAN( SOURCE, SINK, OPTIONS, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan constructor.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new FitsChan and optionally initialises
*     its attributes.
*
*     A FitsChan is a specialised form of Channel which supports I/O
*     operations involving the use of FITS (Flexible Image Transport
*     System) header cards. Writing an Object to a FitsChan (using
c     astWrite) will, if the Object is suitable, generate a
f     AST_WRITE) will, if the Object is suitable, generate a
*     description of that Object composed of FITS header cards, and
*     reading from a FitsChan will create a new Object from its FITS
*     header card description.
*
*     While a FitsChan is active, it represents a buffer which may
*     contain zero or more 80-character "header cards" conforming to
*     FITS conventions. Any sequence of FITS-conforming header cards
*     may be stored, apart from the "END" card whose existence is
*     merely implied.  The cards may be accessed in any order by using
*     the FitsChan's integer Card attribute, which identifies a "current"
*     card, to which subsequent operations apply. Searches
c     based on keyword may be performed (using astFindFits), new
c     cards may be inserted (astPutFits) and existing ones may be
c     deleted (astDelFits).
f     based on keyword may be performed (using AST_FINDFITS), new
f     cards may be inserted (AST_PUTFITS) and existing ones may be
f     deleted (AST_DELFITS).
*
*     When you create a FitsChan, you have the option of specifying
*     "source" and "sink" functions which connect it to external data
*     stores by reading and writing FITS header cards. If you provide
*     a source function, it is used to fill the FitsChan with header
*     cards when it is created. If you do not provide a source
*     function, the FitsChan remains empty until you explicitly enter
c     data into it (e.g. using astPutFits or astWrite). If you
f     data into it (e.g. using AST_PUTFITS or AST_WRITE). If you
*     provide a sink function, it is used to deliver any remaining
*     contents of a FitsChan to an external data store when the
*     FitsChan is deleted. If you do not provide a sink function, any
*     header cards remaining when the FitsChan is deleted will be
*     lost, so you should arrange to extract them first if necessary
c     (e.g. using astFindFits or astRead).
f     (e.g. using AST_FINDFITS or AST_READ).
*     
*     Coordinate system information may be described using FITS header
*     cards using several different conventions, termed
*     "encodings". When an AST Object is written to (or read from) a
*     FitsChan, the value of the FitsChan's Encoding attribute
*     determines how the Object is converted to (or from) a
*     description involving FITS header cards. In general, different
*     encodings will result in different sets of header cards to
*     describe the same Object. Examples of encodings include the DSS
*     encoding (based on conventions used by the STScI Digitised Sky
*     Survey data), the FITS-WCS encoding (based on a proposed FITS
*     standard) and the NATIVE encoding (a near loss-less way of
*     storing AST Objects in FITS headers).
*
*     The available encodings differ in the range of Objects they can
*     represent, in the number of Object descriptions that can coexist
*     in the same FitsChan, and in their accessibility to other
*     (external) astronomy applications (see the Encoding attribute
*     for details). Encodings are not necessarily mutually exclusive
*     and it may sometimes be possible to describe the same Object in
*     several ways within a particular set of FITS header cards by
*     using several different encodings.
*
c     The detailed behaviour of astRead and astWrite, when used with
f     The detailed behaviour of AST_READ and AST_WRITE, when used with
*     a FitsChan, depends on the encoding in use. In general, however,
c     all use of astRead is destructive, so that FITS header cards
f     all use of AST_READ is destructive, so that FITS header cards
*     are consumed in the process of reading an Object, and are
*     removed from the FitsChan.
*
*     If the encoding in use allows only a single Object description
*     to be stored in a FitsChan (e.g. the DSS, FITS-WCS and FITS-IRAF
c     encodings), then write operations using astWrite will
f     encodings), then write operations using AST_WRITE will
*     over-write any existing Object description using that
*     encoding. Otherwise (e.g. the NATIVE encoding), multiple Object
*     descriptions are written sequentially and may later be read
*     back in the same sequence.

*  Parameters:
c     source
f     SOURCE = FUNCTION (Given)
c        Pointer to a source function which takes no arguments and
c        returns a pointer to a null-terminated string. This function
c        will be used by the FitsChan to obtain input FITS header
c        cards. On each invocation, it should read the next input card
c        from some external source (such as a FITS file), and return a
c        pointer to the (null-terminated) contents of the card. It
c        should return a NULL pointer when there are no more cards to
c        be read.
c
c        If "source" is NULL, the FitsChan will remain empty until
c        cards are explicitly stored in it (e.g. using astPutFits).
f        A source routine, which is a function taking two arguments: a
f        character argument of length 80 to contain a FITS card, and an
f        integer error status argument. It should return an integer value.
f        This function will be used by the FitsChan to obtain input
f        FITS header cards. On each invocation, it should read the
f        next input card from some external source (such as a FITS
f        file), and return the contents of the card via its character
f        argument. It should return a function result of one unless
f        there are no more cards to be read, in which case it should
f        return zero. If an error occurs, it should set its error
f        status argument to an error value before returning.
f
f        If the null routine AST_NULL is supplied as the SOURCE value,
f        the FitsChan will remain empty until cards are explicitly
f        stored in it (e.g. using AST_PUTFITS).
c     sink
f     SINK = SUBROUTINE (Given)
c        Pointer to a sink function that takes a pointer to a
c        null-terminated string as an argument and returns void.  This
c        function will be used by the FitsChan to deliver any FITS
c        header cards it contains when it is finally deleted. On 
c        each invocation, it should deliver the contents of the character
c        string passed to it as a FITS header card to some external
c        data store (such as a FITS file).
f        A sink routine, which is a subroutine which takes two
f        arguments: a character argument of length 80 to contain a
f        FITS card, and an integer error status argument. This routine
f        will be used by the FitsChan to deliver any FITS header cards
f        it contains when it is finally deleted. On each invocation,
f        it should deliver the contents of the character string passed
f        to it as a FITS header card to some external data store (such
f        as a FITS file).  If an error occurs, it should set its error
f        status argument to an error value before returning.
*
c        If "sink" is NULL, 
f        If the null routine AST_NULL is supplied as the SINK value,
*        the contents of the FitsChan will not be written out when it
*        is deleted.
c     options
f     OPTIONS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing an optional
c        comma-separated list of attribute assignments to be used for
c        initialising the new FitsChan. The syntax used is identical to
c        that for the astSet function and may include "printf" format
c        specifiers identified by "%" symbols in the normal way.
f        A character string containing an optional comma-separated
f        list of attribute assignments to be used for initialising the
f        new FitsChan. The syntax used is identical to that for the
f        AST_SET routine.
c     ...
c        If the "options" string contains "%" format specifiers, then
c        an optional list of additional arguments may follow it in
c        order to supply values to be substituted for these
c        specifiers. The rules for supplying these are identical to
c        those for the astSet function (and for the C "printf"
c        function).
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astFitsChan()
f     AST_FITSCHAN = INTEGER
*        A pointer to the new FitsChan.

*  Notes:
f     - The names of the routines supplied for the SOURCE and SINK
f     arguments should appear in EXTERNAL statements in the Fortran
f     routine which invokes AST_FITSCHAN. However, this is not generally
f     necessary for the null routine AST_NULL (so long as the AST_PAR
f     include file has been used).
c     - No FITS "END" card will be written via the sink function. You
f     - No FITS "END" card will be written via the sink routine. You
*     should add this card yourself after the FitsChan has been
*     deleted.
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
*     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.
f     - Note that the null routine AST_NULL (one underscore) is
f     different to AST__NULL (two underscores), which is the null Object
f     pointer.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan constructor.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new FitsChan from a foreign language
*     interface and optionally initialises its attributes.
*
*     A FitsChan implements FITS input/output for the AST library.
*     Writing an Object to a FitsChan (using astWrite) will generate a
*     textual representation of that Object in terms of FITS header cards, 
*     and reading from a FitsChan (using astRead) will create a new Object 
*     from its FITS representation.
*
*     Normally, when you use a FitsChan, you should provide "source"
*     and "sink" functions which connect it to an external data store
*     by reading and writing the resulting text. This function also
*     requires you to provide "wrapper" functions which will invoke
*     the source and sink functions. 

*  Parameters:
*     source
*        Pointer to a "source" function which will be used to obtain
*        FITS header cards. Generally, this will be obtained by
*        casting a pointer to a source function which is compatible
*        with the "source_wrap" wrapper function (below). The pointer
*        should later be cast back to its original type by the
*        "source_wrap" function before the function is invoked.
*
*        If "source" is NULL, the FitsChan will remain empty until
*        cards are added explicitly (e.g. using astPutFits).
*     source_wrap
*        Pointer to a function which can be used to invoke the
*        "source" function supplied (above). This wrapper function is
*        necessary in order to hide variations in the nature of the
*        source function, such as may arise when it is supplied by a
*        foreign (non-C) language interface.
*
*        The single parameter of the "source_wrap" function is a
*        pointer to the "source" function, and it should cast this
*        function pointer (as necessary) and invoke the function with
*        appropriate arguments to obtain the next FITS header card.
*        The "source_wrap" function should then return a pointer
*        to a dynamically allocated, null terminated string containing
*        the text that was read. The string will be freed (using
*        astFree) when no longer required and the "source_wrap"
*        function need not concern itself with this. A NULL pointer
*        should be returned if there is no more input to read.
*
*        If "source" is NULL, the FitsChan will remain empty until
*        cards are added explicitly (e.g. using astPutFits).
*     sink
*        Pointer to a "sink" function which will be used to deliver
*        FITS header cards. Generally, this will be obtained by
*        casting a pointer to a sink function which is compatible with
*        the "sink_wrap" wrapper function (below). The pointer should
*        later be cast back to its original type by the "sink_wrap"
*        function before the function is invoked.

*        If "sink" is NULL, the contents of the FitsChan will not be
*        written out before being deleted.
*     sink_wrap
*        Pointer to a function which can be used to invoke the "sink"
*        function supplied (above). This wrapper function is necessary
*        in order to hide variations in the nature of the sink
*        function, such as may arise when it is supplied by a foreign
*        (non-C) language interface.
*
*        The first parameter of the "sink_wrap" function is a pointer
*        to the "sink" function, and the second parameter is a pointer
*        to a const, null-terminated character string containing the
*        text to be written.  The "sink_wrap" function should cast the
*        "sink" function pointer (as necessary) and invoke the
*        function with appropriate arguments to deliver the line of
*        output text. The "sink_wrap" function then returns void.
*
*        If "sink_wrap" is NULL, the contents of the FitsChan will not be
*        written out before being deleted.
*     options
*        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing an optional
*        comma-separated list of attribute assignments to be used for
*        initialising the new FitsChan. The syntax used is identical to
*        that for the astSet function and may include "printf" format
*        specifiers identified by "%" symbols in the normal way.
*     ...
*        If the "options" string contains "%" format specifiers, then
*        an optional list of additional arguments may follow it in
*        order to supply values to be substituted for these
*        specifiers. The rules for supplying these are identical to
*        those for the astSet function (and for the C "printf"
*        function).

*  Returned Value:
*     astFitsChanFor()
*        A pointer to the new FitsChan.

*  Notes:
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
*     function is invoked with the global error status set, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.
*     - This function is only available through the public interface
*     to the FitsChan class (not the protected interface) and is
*     intended solely for use in implementing foreign language
*     interfaces to this class.
*-

*  Implememtation Notes:
*     - This function behaves exactly like astFitsChanId_, in that it
*     returns ID values and not true C pointers, but it has two
*     additional arguments. These are pointers to the "wrapper
*     functions" which are needed to accommodate foreign language
*     interfaces.

*  Class Membership:
*     FitsChan initialiser.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided for use by class implementations to
*     initialise a new FitsChan object. It allocates memory (if
*     necessary) to accommodate the FitsChan plus any additional data
*     associated with the derived class.  It then initialises a
*     FitsChan structure at the start of this memory. If the "init"
*     flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a virtual
*     function table for a FitsChan at the start of the memory passed
*     via the "vtab" parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory in which the FitsChan is to be
*        initialised.  This must be of sufficient size to accommodate
*        the FitsChan data (sizeof(FitsChan)) plus any data used by the
*        derived class. If a value of NULL is given, this function
*        will allocate the memory itself using the "size" parameter to
*        determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the FitsChan (plus derived class
*        data).  This will be used to allocate memory if a value of
*        NULL is given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also
*        stored in the FitsChan structure, so a valid value must be
*        supplied even if not required for allocating memory.
*     init
*        A boolean flag indicating if the FitsChan's virtual function
*        table is to be initialised. If this value is non-zero, the
*        virtual function table will be initialised by this function.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be
*        associated with the new FitsChan.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which
*        contains the name of the class to which the new object
*        belongs (it is this pointer value that will subsequently be
*        returned by the astGetClass method).
*     source
*        Pointer to a "source" function which will be used to obtain
*        FITS header cards. Generally, this will be obtained by
*        casting a pointer to a source function which is compatible
*        with the "source_wrap" wrapper function (below). The pointer
*        should later be cast back to its original type by the
*        "source_wrap" function before the function is invoked.
*
*        If "source" is NULL, the FitsChan will remain empty until
*        cards are added explicitly (e.g. using astPutFits).
*     source_wrap
*        Pointer to a function which can be used to invoke the
*        "source" function supplied (above). This wrapper function is
*        necessary in order to hide variations in the nature of the
*        source function, such as may arise when it is supplied by a
*        foreign (non-C) language interface.
*
*        The single parameter of the "source_wrap" function is a
*        pointer to the "source" function, and it should cast this
*        function pointer (as necessary) and invoke the function with
*        appropriate arguments to obtain the next FITS header card.
*        The "source_wrap" function should then return a pointer
*        to a dynamically allocated, null terminated string containing
*        the text that was read. The string will be freed (using
*        astFree) when no longer required and the "source_wrap"
*        function need not concern itself with this. A NULL pointer
*        should be returned if there is no more input to read.
*
*        If "source" is NULL, the FitsChan will remain empty until
*        cards are added explicitly (e.g. using astPutFits).
*     sink
*        Pointer to a "sink" function which will be used to deliver
*        FITS header cards. Generally, this will be obtained by
*        casting a pointer to a sink function which is compatible with
*        the "sink_wrap" wrapper function (below). The pointer should
*        later be cast back to its original type by the "sink_wrap"
*        function before the function is invoked.
*
*        If "sink" is NULL, the contents of the FitsChan will not be
*        written out before being deleted.
*     sink_wrap
*        Pointer to a function which can be used to invoke the "sink"
*        function supplied (above). This wrapper function is necessary
*        in order to hide variations in the nature of the sink
*        function, such as may arise when it is supplied by a foreign
*        (non-C) language interface.
*
*        The first parameter of the "sink_wrap" function is a pointer
*        to the "sink" function, and the second parameter is a pointer
*        to a const, null-terminated character string containing the
*        text to be written.  The "sink_wrap" function should cast the
*        "sink" function pointer (as necessary) and invoke the
*        function with appropriate arguments to deliver the line of
*        output text. The "sink_wrap" function then returns void.
*
*        If "sink_wrap" is NULL, the contents of the FitsChan will not be
*        written out before being deleted.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new FitsChan.

*  Notes:
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*     from a Channel. It first loads the data used by the parent class

*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the FitsChan (plus derived class
*        data).  This will be used to allocate memory if a value of
*        NULL is given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also
*        stored in the FitsChan structure, so a valid value must be
*        supplied even if not required for allocating memory.
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "size" value is ignored
*        and sizeof(AstFitsChan) is used instead.

*        virtual function table will be initialised by this function.
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "init" value is ignored
*        and the (static) virtual function table initialisation flag
*        for the FitsChan class is used instead.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be
*        associated with the new FitsChan. If this is NULL, a pointer
*        to the (static) virtual function table for the FitsChan class
*        is used instead.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new FitsChan.

*  Notes:
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
