*++
*  Name:
*     object.h

*  Type:
*     C include file.

*  Purpose:
*     Define the interface to the Object class.

*  Invocation:
*     #include "object.h"

*  Description:
*     This include file defines the interface to the Object class and
*     provides the type definitions, function prototypes and macros,
*     etc.  needed to use this class.

*     The Object class is the base class from which all other classes
*     in the AST library are derived. This class provides all the
*     basic Object behaviour and Object manipulation facilities
*     required throughout the library. There is no Object constructor,
*     however, as Objects on their own are not of much use.

*  Inheritance:
*     The Object base class does not inherit from any other class.

*  Attributes Over-Ridden:
*     None.

*  New Attributes Defined:
*     Class (string)
*        This is a read-only attribute containing the name of the
*        class to which an Object belongs.
*     ID (string)
*        An identification string which may be used to identify the
*        Object (e.g.) in debugging output, or when stored in an
*        external medium such as a data file. There is no restriction
*        on the string's contents. The default is an empty string.
*     Ident (string)
*        Like ID, this is an identification string which may be used
*        to identify the Object. Unlike ID, Ident is transferred when an
*        Object is copied.
*     UseDefs (int)
*        Should default values be used for unset attributes?
*     Nobject (integer)
*        This is a read-only attribute which gives the total number of
*        Objects currently in existence in the same class as the
*        Object given. It does not include Objects which belong to
*        derived (more specialised) classes. This value is mainly
*        intended for debugging, as it can be used to show whether
*        Objects which should have been deleted have, in fact, been
*        deleted.
*     ObjSize (int)
*        The in-memory size of the Object in bytes.
*     RefCount (integer)
*        This is a read-only Attribute which gives the "reference
*        count" (the number of active pointers) associated with an
*        Object. It is modified whenever pointers are created or
*        annulled (by astClone or astAnnul/astEnd for example) and
*        includes the initial pointer issued when the Object was
*        created. If the reference count for an Object falls to zero
*        as the result of annulling a pointer to it, then the Object
*        will be deleted.

*  Methods Over-Ridden:
*     None.

*     Public:
*        astAnnul

*           Object virtual function table type.

*  Feature Test Macros:
*     AST_CHECK_CLASS
*        If the AST_CHECK_CLASS macro is defined, then Object class
*        checking is enabled for all internal function invocations
*        within the AST library. Otherwise, this checking is
*        omitted. This macro should normally be defined as a compiler
*        option during library development and debugging, but left
*        undefined for software releases, so as to improve
*        peformance. Class checking by the AST public interface is not
*        affected by this macro.
*     astCLASS
*        If the astCLASS macro is undefined, only public symbols are
*        made available, otherwise protected symbols (for use in other
*        class implementations) are defined. This macro also affects
*        the reporting of error context information, which is only
*        provided for external calls to the AST library.
*     astFORTRAN77
*        If the astFORTRAN77 macro is defined, reporting of error
*        context information is suppressed. This is necessary when
*        implementing foreign language interfaces to the AST library, as
*        otherwise the file names and line numbers given would refer
*        to the interface implementation rather than the user's own
*        code.

*+
*  Name:
*     astINVOKE

*  Type:
*     Protected macro.

*  Purpose:
*     Invoke an AST function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "object.h"
*     astINVOKE(rettype,function)

*  Class Membership:
*     Defined by the Object class.

*  Description:
*     This macro expands to an invocation of an AST function, together
*     with any additional actions required to support it.  The actual
*     expansion depends on whether the macro is expanded in internal
*     code (astCLASS defined) or external code (astCLASS undefined)
*     and it therefore hides the differences between these two
*     interfaces.

*  Parameters:
*     rettype
*        A character to indicate the type of result returned by the function:
*
*        V
*           The function returns a value (including void or a pointer
*           value, but excluding an Object pointer). astINVOKE will
*           return the value unchanged.
*        O
*           The function returns an Object pointer. astINVOKE will
*           convert it to an Object identifier if necessary.
*        F
*           The function returns a function pointer. astINVOKE will
*           return it unchanged. This is typically used when the
*           function has a variable argument list. In this case the
*           function name is passed to astINVOKE without its argument
*           list and a pointer to the function is returned which can
*           then be supplied with an argument list. This avoids the
*           need to define a macro with a variable number of arguments
*           (which isn't allowed).
*     function
*        A normal invocation of the function returning the required
*        result.  In the case of a variable argument list, the
*        argument list should be omitted so that the function is not
*        invoked but a function pointer is returned that may then be
*        used to invoke it.

*  Examples:
*     #define astGetNobject(this) \
*             astINVOKE(V,astGetNobject_(astCheckObject(this)))
*        Defines a macro to invoke the astGetNobject_ function which
*        returns an int.
*     #define astClone(this) \
*             astINVOKE(O,astClone_(astCheckObject(this)))
*        Defines a macro to invoke the astClone_ function which
*        returns an Object pointer.
*     #define astSet astINVOKE(F,astSet_)
*        Defines a macro to invoke the astSet_ function which has a
*        variable argument list and returns void. The macro result is
*        a pointer to the astSet_ function. This function must perform
*        its own argument validation, as (e.g) astCheckObject cannot
*        be invoked on its arguments via a macro.

*  Notes:
*     - To avoid problems with some compilers, you should not leave
*     any white space around the macro arguments.

*     astCheck<Class>_ and astIsA<Class>_ functions for a class.

*  Parameters:
*     class
*        The name (not the type) of the class for which the function
*        is to be invoked.
*     this
*        The "this" argument (the Object pointer) to be passed to the
*        function.
*     force
*        Type checking takes time, and so can be disabled within the
*        protected context in order to save time. Setting "force" to
*        zero causes the astINVOKE_CHECK macro to skip the class check
*        in a protected context (it assumes that AST "knows what it is
*        doing"). Setting "force" to a non-zero value forces the class
*        check even in a protected context.

*  Notes:
*     - To avoid problems with some compilers, you should not leave
*     any white space around the macro arguments.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "object.h"
*     astMEMBER(this,class,method)

*  Class Membership:
*     Defined by the Object class.

*  Description:
*     This macro evaluates to the address where the pointer to a
*     specified Object member function is stored. Typically, this will
*     be used to obtain a pointer to the member function so that it
*     can be invoked. It may also be used to assign a new function
*     pointer so that a derived class can re-define a virtual function
*     and hence over-ride an inherited method.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to an Object belonging to the class for which the
*        virtual function is required. This must either be the class
*        that originally defined the method, or one derived from it.
*     class
*        Name of the class that originally defined the method. This
*        may differ from (i.e. be an ancestor of) the class to which
*        "this" belongs.
*     method
*        Name of the method whose member function is to be located.

*  Returned Value:
*     The address where the member function pointer is stored (the
*     type of the result is determined by the type of the member
*     function itself).

*  Examples:
*     astMEMBER(this,Gnome,astFish)
*        Returns the address where the pointer to the function that
*        implements the astFish method for the "this" object is
*        stored. The Gnome class should be where the astFish method
*        was first defined (i.e. from where it was inherited by
*        "this").
*     (**astMEMBER(this,Gnome,astFish))( this, arg1, arg2 );
*        Invokes the virtual function that implements the astFish
*        method for object "this" and passes it additional arguments
*        "arg2" and "arg2".  Again, Gnome should be the class that
*        originally defined the astFish method.
*     *astMEMBER(this,Gnome,astFish) = myFish;
*        Stores a pointer to the myFish function so that it replaces
*        the virtual function that previously implemented the astFish
*        method for the "this" object. Note that all objects in the
*        same class as "this" are affected, but objects in class
*        "class" are not affected (unless it happens to be the class
*        to which "this" belongs).

*     - To avoid problems with some compilers, you should not leave
