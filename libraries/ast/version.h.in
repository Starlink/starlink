*  Name:
*     version.h

*  Purpose:
*     Declare version numbers

*  Description:
*     Defines macros which expand to the components of the AST version
*     number, namely the major and minor version numbers, and the
*     release number.  The version number as a string is available by
*     including the file config.h, which defines macros PACKAGE_STRING,
*     PACKAGE_VERSION and (equivalently to the latter) VERSION.
*
*     For example, the version string `3.2.1' corresponds to major version
*     3, minor version 2, release 1.

*  Macros defined:
*     AST__VMAJOR
*        The AST major version number
*     AST__VMINOR
*        The AST minor version number
*     AST__RELEASE
*        The AST release number
*
*     For backwards compatibility, this module also declares macros
*     AST_MAJOR_VERS, AST_MINOR_VERS and AST_RELEASE.  The AST__*
*     macros should be used in preference to these, since the latter
*     use (non-standard) single underscores.
