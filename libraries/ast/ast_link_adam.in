#  Name:
#     ast_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Link an ADAM program with the AST library.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This command should only be used when building Starlink ADAM programs
#     which use the AST library, in order to generate the correct arguments
#     to allow the ADAM ``alink'' command to link the program. The arguments
#     generated are written to standard output but may be substituted into
#     the ``alink'' command line in the standard UNIX way using backward
#     quotes (see below).
#
#     By default, it is assumed that you are building an ADAM program which
#     does not produce graphical output. However, switches are provided for
#     linking other types of program. This command should not be used when
#     building stand-alone (non-ADAM) programs. Use the ``ast_link'' command
#     instead.

#  Invocation:
#c     alink program.o -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam [switches]`
#f     alink program.f -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam [switches]`

#  Switches:
#     The following switches may optionally be given to this command to
#     modify its behaviour:
#
#     - ``-csla'': Ignored. Provided for backward compatibility only.
#
#     - ``-fsla'': Ignored. Provided for backward compatibility only.
#
#     - ``-grf'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify which
#     2D graphics system is used to display output from the AST library. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new graphics system yourself and wish to provide your own arguments for
#     linking with it. This switch differs from the other ``grf'' switches in
#     that it assumes that your graphics module implements the complete
#     interface required by the current version of AST. If future versions of
#     AST introduce new functions to the graphics interface, this switch will
#     cause ``unresolved symbol'' errors to occur during linking, warning you
#     that you need to implement new functions in your graphics module. To
#     avoid such errors, you can use one of the other, version-specific,
#     switches in place of the ``-grf'' switch, but these will cause run-time
#     errors to be reported if any AST function is invoked which requires
#     facilities not in the implemented interface.
#
#     - ``-grf_v2.0'': This switch is equivalent to the ``-mygrf'' switch.
#     It indicates that you want to link with your own graphics module which
#     implements the 2D graphics interface required by V2.0 of AST.
#
#     - ``-grf_v3.2'': Indicates that you want to link with your own graphics
#     module which implements the 2D graphics interface required by V3.2 of AST.
#
#     - ``-grf_v5.6'': Indicates that you want to link with your own graphics
#     module which implements the 2D graphics interface required by V5.6 of AST.
#
#     - ``-myerr'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify how
#     error messages produced by the AST library should be delivered. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new error delivery system yourself and wish to provide your own
#     arguments for linking with it. By default, error messages are delivered
#     in the standard ADAM way via the EMS Error Message Service (Starlink
#     System Note SSN/4).
#
#     - ``-mygrf'': This switch has been superceeded by the ``-grf'' switch,
#     but is retained in order to allow applications to be linked with a
#     graphics module which implements the interface used by AST V2.0. It is
#     equivalent to the ``-grf_v2.0'' switch.
#
#     - ``-pgp'': Requests that the program be linked so that 2D
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     Starlink version of the PGPLOT graphics package (which uses GKS
#     for its output). By default, no graphics package is linked and
#     this will result in an error at run time if AST routines are
#     invoked that attempt to generate graphical output.
#
#     - ``-pgplot'': Requests that the program be linked so that 2D
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     standard (or ``native'') version of the PGPLOT graphics
#     package. By default, no graphics package is linked and this will
#     result in an error at run time if AST routines are invoked that
#     attempt to generate graphical output.
#
#     - ``-grf3d'': Requests that no arguments be generated to specify which
#     3D graphics system is used to display output from the AST library. You
#     should use this option only if you have implemented an interface to a
#     new 3D graphics system yourself and wish to provide your own arguments
#     for linking with it.
#
#     - ``-pgp3d'': Requests that the program be linked so that 3D
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via the
#     Starlink version of the PGPLOT graphics package (which uses GKS
#     for its output). By default, no 3D graphics package is linked and
#     this will result in an error at run time if AST routines are
#     invoked that attempt to generate graphical output.
#
#     - ``-pgplot3d'': Requests that the program be linked so that 3D
#     graphical output from the AST library is displayed via
#     the standard (or ``native'') version of the PGPLOT graphics
#     package. By default, no 3D graphics package is linked and this will
#     result in an error at run time if AST routines are invoked that
#     attempt to generate graphical output.

#  SLALIB:
#     The AST distribution includes a cut down subset of the C version of
#     the SLALIB library written by Pat Wallace. This subset contains only
#     the functions needed by the AST library. It is built as part of the
#     process of building AST and is distributed under GPL (and is thus
#     compatible with the AST license). Previous version of this script
#     allowed AST applications to be linked against external SLALIB
#     libraries (either Fortran or C) rather than the internal version.
#     The current version of this script does not provide this option,
#     and always uses the internal SLALIB library. However, for backward
#     compatibility, this script still allows the "-fsla" and "-csla" flags
#     (previously used for selecting which version of SLALIB to use) to be
#     specified, but they will be ignored.

#  Examples:
#c     alink display.o -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -pgplot`
#c        Links an ADAM program ``display'' which uses the standard
#c        version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#c     alink plotit.o -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -grf` -lgrf
#c        Links an ADAM program ``plotit'', written in C. The ``-grf''
#c        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#c        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which
#c        corresponds to the interface required by the current version of AST.
#c        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library
#c        reference.
#c     alink plotit.o -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -grf_v2.0` -lgrf
#c        Links an ADAM program ``plotit'', written in C. The ``-grf_v2.0''
#c        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#c        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which
#c        corresponds to the interface required by version 2.0 of AST. Here,
#c        this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library
#c        reference.
#f     alink display.f -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -pgplot`
#f        Compiles and links an ADAM Fortran program called ``display'' which
#f        uses the standard version of PGPLOT for graphical output.
#f     alink plotit.f -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -grf` -lgrf
#f        Compiles and links an ADAM Fortran program ``plotit''. The ``-grf''
#f        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#f        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which
#f        corresponds to the interface required by the current version of AST.
#f        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library
#f        reference.
#f     alink plotit.f -L. -L/star/lib `ast_link_adam -grf_v2.0` -lgrf
#f        Compiles and links an ADAM Fortran program ``plotit''. The ``-grf_v2.0''
#f        switch indicates that graphical output will be delivered through
#f        a graphical interface which you have implemented yourself, which
#f        corresponds to the interface required by version 2.0 of AST.
#f        Here, this interface is supplied by means of the ``-lgrf'' library
#f        reference.
