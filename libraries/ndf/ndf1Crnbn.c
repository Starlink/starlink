void ndf1Crnbn( NdfDCB *dcb, NdfACB **acb, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Crnbn

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new ACB base NDF entry from a DCB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Crnbn( NdfDCB *dcb, NdfACB **acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new ACB entry describing a base NDF which
*     refers to the data object whose DCB entry is supplied. The new NDF
*     acquires its attributes directly from the data object. The reference
*     count for the DCB entry is incremented by one.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the data object entry in the DCB to which the ACB entry
*        is to refer.
*     *acb
*        Pointer to the new ACB entry.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  If "status" is set on entry, then the function will return a value
*     of zero for the "acb" parameter, although no further processing will
*     occur.
*     -  A value of zero will also be returned for the "acb" parameter if
*     the function fails for any reason.
