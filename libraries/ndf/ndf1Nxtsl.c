void *ndf1Nxtsl( const NdfBlockType type, int slot, int *next, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     ndf1Nxtsl

*  Purpose:
*     Find the next slot which has been used in a specified common
*     block.

*  Synopsis:
*     void *ndf1Nxtsl( const NdfBlockType type, int slot, int *next, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function finds the next used slot in an array following
*     the one supplied via the "slot" argument. It is intended to allow
*     the caller to obtain a list of all slots currently in use. The
*     first slot is obtained by supplying a value of -1 for the "slot"
*     argument. A value of -1 is returned for the "next" argument if
*     there are no further slots in use.

*  Parameters:
*     type
*        The array to search. The integer symbolic constants NDF__DCBTYPE,
*        NDF__ACBTYPE, NDF__PCBTYPE and NDF__FCBTYPE are available to
*        identify these.
*     slot
*        The search starts from the slot with index "slot + 1". A value of
*        -1 should be supplied to search for the first slot in use.
*     next
*        The zero-based index of the slot found. A value of -1 is
*        returned if there are no more slots in use.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Returned function value:
*     A pointer to the object (DCB, ACB, FCB or PCB) in the slot
*     specified by the returned "next" value. The returned pointer should
*     be cast to the appropriate type (NdfDCB, NdfACB, etc).

* Prior Requirements:
*     Since this function accesses global variables, each calling
*     function must ensure that only one thread (the current thread)
*     is searching a list using this function at any one time. To do
*     this, the private NDF macros NDF__xCB_LOCK_MUTEX and
*     NDF__xCB_UNLOCK_MUTEX should be used to lock the appropriate
*     mutex prior to calling this function, and to unlock it afterwards
*     ("x" should be replaced by "A", "D", "F" or "P").

*  Notes:
*     -  This interface is provided so that a more efficient implementation
*     (e.g. using linked lists) might be added later.
