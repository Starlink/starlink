*  Name:
*     ndfNew

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new simple NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfNew( const char *ftype, int ndim, const hdsdim lbnd[],
*                  const hdsdim ubnd[], int *place, int *indf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new simple NDF and returns an identifier for
*     it. The NDF may subsequently be manipulated with the NDF_ functions.

*  Parameters:
*     ftype
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the full type of the
*        NDF's DATA component (e.g. "_REAL" or "COMPLEX_INTEGER").
*     ndim
*        Number of NDF dimensions.
*     lbnd
*        Lower pixel-index bounds of the NDF.
*     ubnd
*        Upper pixel-index bounds of the NDF.
*     *place
*        An NDF placeholder (e.g. generated by the ndfPlace function) which
*        indicates the position in the data system where the new NDF will
*        reside. The placeholder is annulled by this function, and a value
*        of NDF__NOPL will be returned (as defined in the include file
*        "ndf.h").
*     *indf
*        Returned holding the identifier for the new NDF.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function creates a "simple" NDF, i.e. one whose array
*     components will be stored in "simple" form by default (see SGP/38).
*     -  The full data type of the DATA component is specified via the
*     "ftype" parameter and the data type of the VARIANCE component
*     defaults to the same value. These data types may be set individually
*     with the ndfStype function if required.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOID will be returned for the "indf" parameter, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be returned
*     if the function should fail for any reason. In either event, the
*     placeholder will still be annulled. The NDF__NOID constant is defined
*     in the header file "ndf.h".
