#  Name:
#     ndf_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against the ADAM version
#     of the NDF library.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building ADAM applications
#     which use the NDF library in order to generate the correct arguments
#     for the compiler (or ld) command. The arguments generated are written
#     to the standard output.

#  Invocation:
#     The script may be invoked as part of a command such as:
#
#        alink program.f -L/star/lib `ndf_link_adam`

#  History:
#     2-JUN-1994 (RFWS):
#     14-JUL-1997 (RFWS)
#        Added AST_ linking and improved "awk" script.
#     3-AUG-2018 (DSB):
#        The C version of NDF does not use PSX or CHR.
#     23-JUL-2021 (DSB):
#        Previous versions included both libndf_adam and libndf in the
#        returned list of libraries. But all functions required to implement
#        the whole library are in libndf_adam and so libndf is not needed.
#        Including libndf seems to cause problems on some versions of macos
#        because both libraries include a function with the "constructor"
#        attribute (ndf1GetCmdLine). To avoid this issue, remove libndf
#        from the returned list of libraries.

#  Echo the NDF library reference, followed by the list of options for
#  packages on which the NDF library depends. Pass the result through an
#  awk script to remove duplicate library references.
