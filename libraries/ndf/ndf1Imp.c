void ndf1Imp( HDSLoc *loc, NdfACB **acb, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Imp

*  Purpose:
*     Import an NDF structure into the ACB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Imp( HDSLoc *loc, NdfACB **acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function imports an NDF data structure, identified by its HDS
*     locator, into the ACB, returning the index to the base NDF entry in
*     the ACB allocated for it. This function detects if the same data
*     object has previously been imported and takes account of this
*     possibility.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        HDS locator to the data object to be imported.
*     *acb
*        Pointer to the resulting base NDF entry in the ACB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If "status" is set on entry, then a value of zero will be returned
*     for the "acb" parameter, although no further processing will occur.
*     -  A value of zero will also be returned for the "acb" parameter if
*     the function fails for any reason.
