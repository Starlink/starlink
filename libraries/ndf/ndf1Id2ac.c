NdfObject *ndf1Id2ac( int id, const int isacb ) {

*  Name:
*     ndf1Id2Ac

*  Purpose:
*     Convert an identifier into the associated ACB or PCB pointer.

*  Synopsis:
*     NdfObject *ndf1Id2ac( int id, const int isacb )

*  Description:
*     The routine converts an identifier (NDF or placeholder), previously
*     issued by ndf1Expid, into a pointer to the appropriate ACB pr PCB
*     structure. The identifier supplied is fully checked and a NULL pointer
*     is returned if it is not valid.

*  Parameters:
*     id
*        The integer identifier for an NDF or placeholder.
*     isacb
*        Indicates the type of object expected by the calling function.
*        Non-zero indicates an ACB is expected. Zero indicates a PCB is
*        expected.

*  Returned function value:
*     Pointer to the ACB or PCB structure, or NULL of the identifier supplied
*     was not valid.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine does not perform error checking or reporting.
