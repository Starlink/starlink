*  Name:
*     ndf1Rdast

*  Purpose:
*     Read AST_ data as text from an HDS object.

*  Synopsis:
*     const char *ndf1Rdast( void )

*  Description:
*     This is a service function to be provided as a "source" function for
*     the "astChannel" function. It reads data from an HDS object (in
*     response to reading from an AST_ Channel) and delivers it to the AST_
*     library for interpretation.
*
*     This function communicates with other NDF_ functions via global
*     variables. These are described below under "Global Variables used as
*     Arguments".

*  Thread Safety:
*     This function is not thread safe. Therefore this function should
*     not be called simulatentously from more than one thread. In a
*     multi-threaded context, the function that calls astread or astWrite
*     should lock the mutex that serialises access to the global variables.

*  Global Variables used as Arguments:
*     Ndf_DCB_astlc = HDSLoc * (Given)
*        A locator for the HDS object which holds the data. This must be a
*        1-dimensional _CHAR array, whose size and character string length
*        will be determined via this locator.
*     Ndf_DCB_astln = int
*        This must initially be set to the value 0, to indicate that data
*        will be read starting at the first element of the HDS array (note
*        the function will not operate correctly unless 0 is the initial
*        value - you cannot start reading at another point in the array if
*        you have previously read from a different array). On exit it will
*        be incremented by the number of elements used to obtain data, so
*        that it identifies the first element to be used on the next
*        invocation.
*     Ndf_DCB_astpt = int
*        A pointer to the contents of the HDS object, mapped in "READ"
*        mode.
