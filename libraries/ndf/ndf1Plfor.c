void ndf1Plfor( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, NdfPCB **pcb, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Plfor

*  Purpose:
*     Create a PCB placeholder entry for an NDF possibly associated with a
*     foreign file.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Plfor( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, NdfPCB **pcb,
*                     int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a PCB placeholder entry for a new NDF which may
*     be associated with a foreign format file, and returns its PCB index.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        Locator which, in conjunction with the "name" value, identifies
*        the new NDF. A value of NULL may be given to indicate that
*        "name" contains the absolute name of an NDF object or of a foreign
*        format file.
*     name
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the new
*        NDF. If "loc" is set to NULL, this should be an absolute NDF
*        name, or the name of a foreign format file. Otherwise it should be
*        a relative NDF name.
*     *pcb
*        Pointer to the new PCB entry.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of zero
*     will be returned for the "pcb" parameter. The same value will also be
*     returned if the function should fail for any reason.
*     -  This function operates in conjunction with ndf1Prfor, which should
*     be kept in step with any changes.
