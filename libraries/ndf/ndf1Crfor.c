*  Name:
*     ndf1Crfor

*  Purpose:
*     Create a placeholder foreign output file.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Crfor( const char *file, NdfFCB *fcb, char *expfil,
*                     size_t expfil_length, char *fid, size_t fid_length,
*                     int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates an empty placeholder foreign format output
*     file, over-writing any pre-existing file with the same name if
*     necessary. This operation is intended to validate the name of a new
*     foreign format file and also to reserve a place for it in the filing
*     system, subject to any external constraints (e.g. file access
*     restrictions). The dummy file will normally be deleted and replaced
*     with the real file at a later stage, but it meanwhile serves as a
*     placeholder, permitting the detection of file access problems
*     associated with possible multiple use of the same output file name.
*
*     The fully expanded name of the output file is returned, along with an
*     associated file identification code.

*  Parameters:
*     file
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the file
*        to be created.
*     fcb
*        Pointer to an object describing the foreign file format (must be
*        non-NULL).
*     expfil
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the fully expanded file name.
*     expfil_length
*        The length of the supplied 'expfil' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     fid
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the file identification code which uniquely identifies the
*        file.
*     fid_length
*        The length of the supplied 'fid' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     An empty file with the specified name should always exist after a
*     successful invocation of this function.
