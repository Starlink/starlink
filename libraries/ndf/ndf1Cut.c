*  Name:
*     ndf1Cut

*  Purpose:
*     Cut a section from an existing NDF with an entry in the ACB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Cut( NdfACB *acb1, int ndim, const hdsdim lbnd[],
*                   const hdsdim ubnd[], NdfACB **acb2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function produces a new NDF entry in the ACB representing a
*     section from an existing NDF (which may itself be a section). The
*     bounds and dimensionality of the new NDF are specified in the call to
*     this function and the resulting NDF has access to a subset (although
*     possibly a null subset) of the data accessible to the initial NDF
*     from which it is derived.

*  Parameters:
*     acb1
*        Pointer to the ACB entry for an existing NDF.
*     ndim
*        Number of dimensions for the new section.
*     lbnd
*        Lower dimension bounds for the section. The supplied "lbnd" array
*        should have at least "ndim" elements.
*     ubnd
*        Upper dimension bounds for the section. The supplied "ubnd" array
*        should have at least "ndim" elements.
*     *acb2
*        Pointer to the ACB entry for the new section.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If "status" is set on entry, then a value of zero will be returned
*     for the "acb2" parameter, although no further processing will occur.
*     -  A value of zero will also be returned for the "acb2" parameter if
*     the function fails for any reason.
