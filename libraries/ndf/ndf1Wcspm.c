*  Name:
*     ndf1Wcspm

*  Purpose:
*     Determine pixel limits for all NDF axes.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Wcspm( AstMapping *map, const hdsdim lbnd[], const hdsdim ubnd[],
*                     int perm[], int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a permutation array that embodies a guess at
*     the correspondance between pixel and WCS axes. In some cases there is
*     no defined correspondance between WCS and pixel axes, and so we need
*     to just guess at what the user means when entering WCS axis values in
*     a certain order (e.g. in an NDF section specified in WCS). For
*     instance in a 2D image of the sky there no way of assigning one pixel
*     axis to the RA axis and the other pixel axis to the Dec axis. To see
*     that this is the case, consider an image in which the WCS axes are
*     linear and at 45 degrees to the pixel axes. Varying either pixel axes
*     independently of the other one will make equal changes to both RA and
*     Dec values.
*
*     Having said that, the 45 degree case is rare and we will usually be
*     able to have some confidence that the user will associate each WCS
*     axis with the "closest" pixel axis.
*
*     In the 45 degree case, the returned permuatation array is based on
*     the assumption that each WCS axis corresponds to the pixel axis with
*     the same index as the WCS axis.

*  Parameters:
*     map
*        AST pointer to the Mapping from pixel coordinates to WCS.
*     lbnd
*        Lower pixel index bounds for the NDF.
*     ubnd
*        Upper pixel index bounds for the NDF.
*     perm
*        The index into this array is pixel index, and the values stored in
*        the array are the corresponding WCS axis indices. A value of 0 is
*        returned for any pixel axes that have no corresponding WCS axis.
*     *status
*        The global status.
