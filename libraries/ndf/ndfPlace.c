void ndfPlace_( const HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, int *place, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfPlace

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain an NDF placeholder.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfPlace( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, int *place, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns an NDF placeholder. A placeholder is used to
*     identify a position in the underlying data system (HDS) and may be
*     passed to other functions (e.g. ndfNew) to indicate where a newly
*     created NDF should be positioned.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        HDS locator to the structure to contain the new NDF.
*     name
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the new
*        structure component (i.e. the NDF).
*     *place
*        Returned holding the NDF placeholder identifying the nominated
*        position in the data system.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Placeholders are intended only for local use within an application
*     and only a limited number of them are available simultaneously. They
*     are always annulled as soon as they are passed to another function to
*     create a new NDF, where they are effectively exchanged for an NDF
*     identifier.
*     -  The value given for the "name" parameter may be an HDS path name,
*     consisting of several fields separated by ".", so that an NDF can be
*     created in a sub-component (or a sub-sub-component...) of the
*     structure identified by the locator "loc".  Array subscripts may also
*     be used in this component name.  Thus a string such as
*     "MYSTRUC.ZONE(2).IMAGE" could be used as a valid "name" value.
*     -  Normally, this function will be used as the basis for creating a
*     completely new NDF data structure. However, if the "loc" and "name"
*     arguments refer to a pre-existing object, then this structure will be
*     used as the basis for the new NDF.  An object which is to be used in
*     this way must be an empty scalar structure with an HDS type of "NDF".
*     -  A new NDF can be created within an explicitly named container file
*     by supplying the symbolic value NULL for the "loc" parameter,
*     and specifying the container file within the value supplied for the
*     "name" parameter. If the object is the top level object within a
*     container file, then a new container file is created. If it is not a
*     top level object, then the container file and all structures lying
*     above the object should already exist.
*     -  If a blank value is given for the "name" parameter, then the new
*     NDF will be the object identified directly by the locator "loc". This
*     must be an empty scalar structure of type "NDF".
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOPL will be returned for the "place" parameter, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be returned
*     if the function should fail for any reason.
*     -  The NDF__NOPL constant is defined in the header file "ndf.h". The
*     NULL constant is defined in the header file "dat_par.h" (see
*     SUN/92).
