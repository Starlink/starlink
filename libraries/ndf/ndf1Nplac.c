void ndf1Nplac( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, NdfPCB **pcb, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Nplac

*  Purpose:
*     Create an NDF placeholder entry in the PCB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Nplac( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, NdfPCB **pcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates an NDF placeholder entry in the PCB for a new
*     NDF. This is used to identify a position in the underlying data
*     system and may be passed to other functions to indicate where a newly
*     created NDF should be positioned.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        HDS locator which, inconjunction with the "name" parameter,
*        identifies the structure which is to become a new NDF. A value of
*        NULL may be supplied to indicate that the "name" parameter
*        contains an absolute object name.
*     name
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name to be used
*        together with the "loc" value to identify the placeholder object.
*        If "loc" is set to NULL, this should be the absolute HDS name
*        of the object, otherwise it should be a relative name.
*     *pcb
*        Pointer to a new PCB entry identifying the nominated position in
*        the data system.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the object identified by "loc" and "name" exists before this
*     function is invoked (and it is not a top-level object), then it
*     should be an empty scalar structure of type "NDF", otherwise an error
*     will result.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of zero
*     will be returned for the "pcb" parameter, although no further
*     processing will occur. The same value will also be returned if the
*     function should fail for any reason.
