*  Name:
*     ndfCopy

*  Purpose:
*     Copy an NDF to a new location.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfCopy( int indf1, int *place, int *indf2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function copies an NDF to a new location and returns an
*     identifier for the resulting new base NDF.

*  Parameters:
*     indf1
*        Identifier for the NDF (or NDF section) to be copied.
*     *place
*        An NDF placeholder (e.g. generated by the ndfPlace function) which
*        indicates the position in the data system where the new NDF will
*        reside. The placeholder is annulled by this function, and a value
*        of NDF__NOPL will be returned (as defined in the include file
*        "ndf.h").
*     *indf2
*        Returned holding the identifier for the new NDF.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOID will be returned for the "indf2" parameter, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be returned
*     if the function should fail for any reason.  In either event the
*     placeholder will still be annulled.  The NDF__NOID constant is
*     defined in the header file "ndf.h".
