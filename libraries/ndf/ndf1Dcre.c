void ndf1Dcre( const char *ftype, int ndim, const hdsdim lbnd[],

*  Name:
*     ndf1Dcre

*  Purpose:
*     Create a simple NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Dcre( const char *ftype, int ndim, const hdsdim lbnd[],
*                    const hdsdim ubnd[], NdfPCB *pcb, NdfACB **acb,
*                    int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a simple NDF data object containing just a data
*     array component and returns an ACB index which refers to the
*     resulting new base NDF. The location of the new object is identified
*     by means of an index to a placeholder entry in the PCB. This
*     placeholder should later be annulled.

*  Parameters:
*     ftype
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the full data type of
*        the NDF's data array.
*     ndim
*        Number of NDF dimensions.
*     lbnd
*        Lower bounds of the NDF. The supplied "lbnd" array should have at
*        least "ndim" elements.
*     ubnd
*        Upper bounds of the NDF. The supplied "ubnd" array should have at
*        least "ndim" elements.
*     pcb
*        Pointer to a placeholder entry in the PCB which specifies the
*        location (and certain properties) of the new NDF.
*     *acb
*        Pointer to the ACB entry which refers to the new base NDF.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.
