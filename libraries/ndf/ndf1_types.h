/* ------------------------- */

/* Define a structure to contain information used internally by the NDF_

   correspondence between each such structure (DCB) and the data objects
   (NDFs) in use by the system. Note that each DCB may be referenced by more
   than one Access Control Block (ACB).

   Historical note: The word "block" is a hangover from the Fortran version
   of the NDF library, where "block" refered to a Fortran common block.
   The "DCB" was a common block containing information about all known
   data objects (each one described by a "slot" in the "DCB"). By
   contrast, in the C version of the NDF library a "DCB" is a single
   structure describing a single data object. In this new sense the word
   "block" can be thought of as refering to a block of memory containing the
   structure. The same issue also attaches to the use of the word "block"
   in the other structures described below (ACB, FCB, etc).
