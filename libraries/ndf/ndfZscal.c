*  Name:
*     ndfZscal

*  Purpose:
*     Create a compressed copy of an NDF using "scale" compression

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfZscal( int indf1, const char *type, double scale[],
*                    double zero[], int *place, int *indf2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new NDF holding a compressed copy of the
*     supplied NDF. The compression is performed by scaling the DATA and
*     VARIANCE arrays using a simple linear scaling, and then casting the
*     scaled values into the specified data type. The amount of
*     compression, and the amount of information lost, is thus determined
*     by the input and output data types. For instance, if the input NDF is
*     of type _DOUBLE (eight bytes) and the output is of type _WORD (two
*     bytes), the compression ratio for each array component will be four
*     to one.

*  Parameters:
*     indf1
*        Identifier for the input NDF.
*     type
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the numeric type of
*        the output NDF's DATA component (e.g. "_REAL" or "_INTEGER").
*     scale
*        The scale factors to use when compressing the array components in
*        the supplied NDF. The DATA array will be scaled using "scale"( 1 )
*        and the VARIANCE array - if present - will be scaled using
*        "scale"( 2 ). If either of these is set to VAL__BADD, then a
*        suitable value will be found automatically by inspecting the
*        supplied array values. The values actually used will be returned
*        on exit. See "Notes:" below. On exit, any supplied values will be
*        rounded to values that can be represented accurately in the data
*        type of the input NDF. The supplied "scale" array should have at
*        least "2" elements.
*     zero
*        The zero offsets to use when compressing the array components in
*        the supplied NDF. The DATA array will be offset using "zero"( 1 )
*        and the VARIANCE array - if present - will be offset using "zero"(
*        2 ). If either of these is set to VAL__BADD, then a suitable value
*        will be found automatically by inspecting the supplied array
*        values. The values actually used will be returned on exit. See
*        "Notes:" below. On exit, any supplied values will be rounded to
*        values that can be represented accurately in the data type of the
*        input NDF. The supplied "zero" array should have at least "2"
*        elements.
*     *place
*        An NDF placeholder (e.g. generated by the ndfPlace function) which
*        indicates the position in the data system where the new NDF will
*        reside. The placeholder is annulled by this function, and a value
*        of NDF__NOPL will be returned (as defined in the include file
*        "ndf.h").
*     *indf2
*        Returned holding the identifier for the new NDF.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The compressed data may not be of type _DOUBLE. An error will be
*     reported if "type" is "_DOUBLE".
*     -  Only arrays that are stored in SIMPLE or PRIMITIVE form can be
*     compressed. An error is reported if any other storage form is
*     encountered whilst compressing the input NDF.
*     -  The uncompressed array values are obtained by multiplying the
*     compressed values by "scale" and then adding on "zero".
*     -  The default scale and zero values (used if VAL__BADD values are
*     supplied for "scale" and/or "zero") are chosen so that the extreme
*     array values will fit into the dynamic range of the output data type,
*     allowing a small safety margin.
*     -  Complex arrays cannot be compressed using this function. An error
*     will be reported if the input NDF has a complex type, or if "TYPE"
*     represents a complex data type.
*     -  The resulting NDF will be read-only. An error will be reported if
*     an attempt is made to map it for WRITE or UPDATE access.
*     - When the output NDF is mapped for READ access, uncompression occurs
*     automatically. The pointer returned by ndfMap provides access to the
*     uncompressed array values.
*     -  The result of copying a compressed NDF (for instance, using
*     ndfProp, etc.) will be an equivalent uncompressed NDF.
*     - When applied to a compressed NDF, the ndfType and ndfFtype
*     functions return information about the data type of the uncompressed
*     NDF.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOID will be returned for the "indf2" parameter, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be returned
*     if the function should fail for any reason. In either event, the
*     placeholder will still be annulled. The NDF__NOID constant is defined
*     in the header file "ndf.h".
