void ndf1Opfor( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, const char *mode,

/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Opfor

*  Purpose:
*     Open an NDF, possibly converting from a foreign format file.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Opfor( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, const char *mode,
*                     NdfACB **acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function opens an existing NDF for a specified form of access,
*     importing it into the NDF_ system and returning an ACB index for it.
*     If the object specified does not exist in native NDF format, then a
*     search may be made (according to the contents of the Format
*     Conversion Block and the Tuning Control Block) for a suitable foreign
*     format file which may be converted into NDF format and then accessed.
*     If a foreign format file is accessed, then the NDF name supplied is
*     interpreted as the name of that file, although in all cases a
*     subscript expression may also be appended.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        Locator which, in conjunction with the "name" value, identifies
*        the NDF to be opened. A value of NULL may be given to
*        indicate that "name" contains the absolute name of an NDF object
*        or of a foreign format file.
*     name
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF to
*        be opened. If "loc" is set to NULL, this should be an
*        absolute NDF name, or the name of a foreign format file (with an
*        optional subscript expression appended). Otherwise it should be a
*        relative NDF name.
*     mode
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the required mode of
*        access to the NDF ("READ", "UPDATE" or "WRITE").
*     *acb
*        Pointer to the new NDF entry in the ACB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of zero
*     will be returned for the "acb" parameter, although no further
*     processing will occur.  The same value will also be returned if the
*     function should fail for any reason.
