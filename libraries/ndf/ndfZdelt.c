*  Name:
*     ndfZdelt

*  Purpose:
*     Create a compressed copy of an NDF using DELTA compression

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfZdelt( int indf1, const char *comp, float minrat, int zaxis,
*                    const char *type, int *place, int *indf2,
*                    float *zratio, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a copy of the supplied NDF, and then compresses
*     selected array components within the copy using delta compression.
*     This compression is lossless, but only operates on arrays holding
*     integer values. It assumes that adjacent integer values in each input
*     array tend to be close in value, and so differences between adjacent
*     values can be represented in fewer bits than the absolute values
*     themselves. The differences are taken along a nominated pixel axis
*     within the supplied array (specified by parameter "zaxis"). Any input
*     value that differs from its earlier neighbour by more than the data
*     range of the selected data type is stored explicitly using the data
*     type of the input array.
*
*     Further compression is achieved by replacing runs of equal input
*     values by a single occurrence of the value with a correspsonding
*     repetition count.
*
*     It should be noted that the degree of compression achieved is
*     dependent on the nature of the data, and it is possible for a
*     compressed array to occupy more space than the uncompressed array.
*     The mean compression factor actually achieved is returned in
*     parameter "zratio" (the ratio of the supplied NDF size to the
*     compressed NDF size).

*  Parameters:
*     indf1
*        Identifier for the input NDF.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding A comma-separated list
*        of component names to be compressed. These may be selected from
*        "DATA, "VARIANCE" or "QUALITY". Additionally, if "*" is supplied
*        all three components will be compressed.
*     minrat
*        The minimum allowed compression ratio for an array (the ratio of
*        the supplied array size to the compressed array size). If
*        compressing an array results in a compression ratio smaller than
*        or equal to "minrat", then the array is left uncompressed in the
*        returned NDF. If the supplied value is zero or negative, then each
*        array will be compressed regardless of the compression ratio.
*     zaxis
*        The index of the pixel axis along which differences are to be
*        taken. If this is zero, a default value will be selected for each
*        array that gives the greatest compression. An error will be
*        reported if a value less than zero or greater than the number of
*        axes in the input array is supplied.
*     type
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the data type in which
*        to store the differences between adjacent array values. This must
*        be one of "_BYTE", "_WORD" or "_INTEGER". Additionally, a blank
*        string may be supplied in which case a default value will be
*        selected for each array that gives the greatest compression.
*     *place
*        An NDF placeholder (e.g. generated by the ndfPlace function) which
*        indicates the position in the data system where the new NDF will
*        reside. The placeholder is annulled by this function, and a value
*        of NDF__NOPL will be returned (as defined in the include file
*        "ndf.h").
*     *indf2
*        Returned holding the identifier for the new NDF.
*     *zratio
*        Returned holding the mean compression ratio actually achieved for
*        the array components specified by "comp". The compression ratio
*        for an array is the ratio of the number of bytes needed to hold
*        the numerical values in the supplied array, to the number of bytes
*        needed to hold the numerical values in the compressed array. It
*        does not include the small overheads associated with the extra
*        labels, etc, needed to store compressed data, and so may be
*        inaccurate for small arrays. Additionally, this ratio only takes
*        the specified array components into account. If the NDF contains
*        significant quantities of data in other components, then the
*        overall compression of the whole NDF will be less.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  An error is reported if any of the arrays to be compressed holds
*     floating point values. The exception is that floating point values
*     that are stored as scaled integers (see ndfZscal) are accepted.
*     -  If the input NDF is already stored in DELTA format, it will be
*     uncompressed and then recompressed using the supplied parameter
*     values.
*     -  An error will result if any of the specified array components of
*     the input NDF are currently mapped for access.
*     -  Complex arrays cannot be compressed using this function. An error
*     will be reported if the input NDF has a complex type, or if "TYPE"
*     represents a complex data type.
*     -  Delta compressed arrays are read-only. An error will be reported
*     if an attempt is made to map a delta compressed array for WRITE or
*     UPDATE access.
*     - When delta compressed arrays are mapped for READ access,
*     uncompression occurs automatically. The pointer returned by ndfMap
*     provides access to the uncompressed array values.
*     -  The result of copying a compressed NDF (for instance, using
*     ndfProp, etc.) will be an equivalent uncompressed NDF.
*     - When applied to a compressed NDF, the ndfType and ndfFtype
*     functions return information about the data type of the uncompressed
*     NDF.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOID will be returned for the "indf2" parameter, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be returned
*     if the function should fail for any reason. In either event, the
*     placeholder will still be annulled. The NDF__NOID constant is defined
*     in the header file "ndf.h".
