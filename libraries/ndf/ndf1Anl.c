void ndf1Anl( NdfACB **acb, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Anl

*  Purpose:
*     Annul an NDF entry in the ACB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Anl( NdfACB **acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function annuls an NDF entry in the ACB. If any NDF component is
*     currently mapped for access through this entry, then it is first
*     unmapped. The ACB entry is then annulled, i.e. the slot is released
*     and made available for re-use. If, as a result, the reference count
*     for the associated data object drops to zero, then the object will be
*     released from the NDF_ system and may be deleted, according to its
*     disposal mode.

*  Parameters:
*     *acb
*        Pointer to the ACB to be annulled. NULL is returned.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
