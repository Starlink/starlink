int ndf1IsValid( NdfObject *object ) {
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1IsValid

*  Purpose:
*     Checks that the supplied object (DCB, ACB, FCB or PCB) is valid.

*  Synopsis:
*     int ndf1IsValid( NdfObject *object )

*  Description:
*     The routine returns a flag indicating if the supplied object
*     (DCB, ACB, FCB or PCB) is valid.

*  Parameters:
*     object
*        Pointer to the object to check. It should be of type NdfDCB,
*        NdfACB, NdfFCB or NdfPCB.

*  Returned function value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if the supplied object is valid, and
*     zero if it is invalid.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function does not check the error status or report any error.
