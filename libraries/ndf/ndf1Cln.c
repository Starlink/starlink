*  Name:
*     ndf1Cln

*  Purpose:
*     Clone an ACB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Cln( NdfACB *acb1, NdfACB **acb2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function "clones" an ACB entry, producing a new entry which is a
*     duplicate of the original (except that no components are mapped for
*     access). The data object reference count in the DCB is incremented by
*     one.

*  Parameters:
*     acb1
*        Pointer to the ACB entry to be cloned.
*     *acb2
*        Pointer to the new ACB entry.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If "status" is set on entry, then a value of zero will be returned
*     for the "acb2" parameter, although no further processing will occur.
*     -  A value of zero will also be returned for the "acb2" parameter if
*     the function fails for any reason.
