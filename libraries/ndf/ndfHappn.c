void ndfHappn_( const char *appn, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfHappn

*  Purpose:
*     Declare a new application name for NDF history recording.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfHappn( const char *appn, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function declares a new application name to be used as the
*     default for subsequent recording of NDF history information. The name
*     supplied will subsequently be used when creating new history records
*     whenever a blank application name is passed to a function which
*     writes new history information. It will also be used as the
*     application name when recording default history information.
*
*     If this function is not called, then a system-supplied default name
*     will be used in its place.

*  Parameters:
*     appn
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the new
*        application. If a blank value is supplied, then the name will
*        revert to the system-supplied default.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function should normally only be called to set up an
*     application name in cases where better information is available than
*     is provided by the default. For example, writers of environment-level
*     software may be able to include a software version number in the name
*     so that individual applications need not duplicate this in their own
*     calls to NDF history functions.
*     -  The maximum number of application name characters which can be
*     stored by this function is given by the constant NDF__SZAPP.  The
*     name supplied will be truncated without error if more then this
*     number of characters are supplied. The NDF__SZAPP constant is defined
*     in the header file "ndf.h".
