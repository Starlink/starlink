#  Name:
#     ndf_link

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against the standalone
#     NDF library.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building standalone
#     applications which use the NDF library in order to generate the
#     correct arguments for the compiler (or ld) command. The arguments
#     generated are written to the standard output.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a compiler command line,
#     such as:
#
#        f77 -o program -L/star/lib `ndf_link [ast_switches]` program.f
#
#     The possible values for [ast_switches] are the same as those available 
#     to the ast_link command.
