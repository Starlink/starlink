*  Name:
*     ndf1Hwrt

*  Purpose:
*     Write text lines to the history component of an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Hwrt( NdfDCB *dcb, const char *appn, int nlines,
*                    int linelen, const char *text, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function writes lines of text to the history component of an
*     NDF. If the history has not yet been modified by the current
*     application (and "appn" is not "<"append">"), it creates a new
*     history record, initialises it, and inserts the text suppled. If the
*     history has already been modified (or if "appn" is "<"append">"),
*     then the new text is simply appended to any already present. The
*     function returns without action if the NDF does not have a history
*     component.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the NDF whose history is to be modified.
*     appn
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        application. This is only used (to initialise the new history
*        record) if the history has not yet been modified by the current
*        application, otherwise it is ignored. If a blank value is given,
*        then a suitable default will be used instead. The special value
*        "<"append">" may be supplied in order to append the text lines to
*        the current history text even if the  history has not yet been
*        modified by the current application.
*     nlines
*        Number of new lines of text to be added to the history record
*        (must be at least 1).
*     linelen
*        The length of each spaced-padded fixed-length string in text.
*     text
*        Pointer to a character array holding the input text lines to be
*        copied. It's length should be at least "nlines*linelen". Each line
*        of text should be space-padded to occupy a length of "linelen"
*        characters. Note, there should be no terminating null characters
*        in this array.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If a new history record is being initialised, then the text length
*     (characters per line) of the new record is determined by the length
*     of the elements of the "text" array. If the history record has
*     already been written to, then the existing text length is not altered
*     and assignment of new values takes place using Fortran character
*     assignment rules. No error occurs if text is truncated.
*     -  This function does not perform any formatting or translation
*     operations on the text supplied.
