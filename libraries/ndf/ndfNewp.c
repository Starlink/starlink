*  Name:
*     ndfNewp

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new primitive NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfNewp( const char *ftype, int ndim, const hdsdim ubnd[],
*                   int *place, int *indf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new primitive NDF and returns an identifier
*     for it. The NDF may subsequently be manipulated with the NDF_
*     functions.

*  Parameters:
*     ftype
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the data type of the
*        NDF's DATA component (e.g. "_REAL"). Note that complex types are
*        not permitted when creating a primitive NDF.
*     ndim
*        Number of NDF dimensions.
*     ubnd
*        Upper pixel-index bounds of the NDF (the lower bound of each
*        dimension is taken to be 1).
*     *place
*        An NDF placeholder (e.g. generated by the ndfPlace function) which
*        indicates the position in the data system where the new NDF will
*        reside. The placeholder is annulled by this function, and a value
*        of NDF__NOPL will be returned (as defined in the include file
*        "ndf.h").
*     *indf
*        Returned holding the identifier for the new NDF.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function creates a "primitive" NDF, i.e. one whose array
*     components are stored in "primitive" form by default (see SGP/38).
*     -  The full type of the DATA component is specified via the "ftype"
*     parameter and the type of the VARIANCE component defaults to the same
*     value. These types may be set individually with the ndfStype function
*     if required.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOID will be returned for the "indf" parameter, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be returned
*     if the function should fail for any reason. In either event, the
*     placeholder will still be annulled. The NDF__NOID constant is defined
*     in the header file "ndf.h".
