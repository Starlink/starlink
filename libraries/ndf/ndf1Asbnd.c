*  Name:
*     ndf1Asbnd

*  Purpose:
*     Set new pixel-index bounds for an NDF's axis component.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Asbnd( int ndim, const hdsdim lbnd[], const hdsdim ubnd[],
*                     NdfACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets new pixel index bounds for an NDF's axis
*     component, including possible changes in the number of NDF
*     dimensions. Existing values held in axis arrays are retained or
*     extrapolated, as appropriate.

*  Parameters:
*     ndim
*        New number of NDF dimensions.
*     lbnd
*        New lower pixel-index bounds. The supplied "lbnd" array should
*        have at least "ndim" elements.
*     ubnd
*        New upper pixel-index bounds. The supplied "ubnd" array should
*        have at least "ndim" elements.
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF entry in the ACB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function can only be used to change the bounds of a base NDF.
*     It will return without action if an NDF section is supplied.
*     -  The NDF's axis structure need not exist.
*     -  This function should be invoked prior to changing the bounds of
*     the NDF's main data array, upon whose shape the process of
*     extrapolating axis arrays depends.
