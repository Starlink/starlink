void ndf1Infcb( int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Infcb

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise the NDF_ Format Conversion Block.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Infcb( int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function initialises the NDF_ Format Conversion Block (FCB)
*     which holds information about the foreign data formats which
*     should be recognised by the NDF_ library and which may be converted
*     to and from native NDF format. This information is obtained by
*     translating appropriate environment variables.
*
*     This function only executes once, during global initialisation. It
*     should not be called again.

*  Parameters:
*     *status
*        The global status.
