*  Name:
*     IRQ_COM

*  Purpose:
*     Define IRQ_ common block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global variables include file.

*  Description:
*     This file defines global variables which describe the state of
*     IRQ, and properties of each compiled quality expression known to
*     IRQ. Information describing each quality expression is stored in
*     arrays in common. The same element from different arrays holds
*     information for the same quality expression. Different elements
*     within each array hold information for different quality
*     expressions.  The identifiers used by IRQ to identify each
*     quality expression are just the index into these common arrays at
*     which the information describing the quality expression is stored.
*     The arrays have a lower bound of 1 and an upper bound given by
*     symbolic constant IRQ__MAXQ.
*
*     Note, the op. codes and quality masks which actually form the
*     quality expression are not stored in common, but are stored in a
*     temporary HDS structure.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The SAE_PAR and IRQ_PAR include files should be included before
*     this file, in order to define constants used here.

*  Global Variables:

*  NDF identifiers.
*  ================
*  Each quality expression refers to a particular NDF. QCM_INDF holds
*  cloned NDF identifiers for each such NDF.
      INTEGER QCM_INDF( IRQ__MAXQ )

*  Variable quality masks
*  ======================
*  The number of masks needed to evaluate each compiled quality
*  expression. Each such mask is combined with a QUALITY value to
*  determine some logical value required to evaluate the quality
*  expression.
      INTEGER QCM_NMASK( IRQ__MAXQ )

*  Maximum stack size needed to evaluate the quality expression.
*  ============================================================
*  The maximum size of the "First In Last Out" stack used to evaluate
*  the quality expression, using Reverse Polish representation.
      INTEGER QCM_MXSTK( IRQ__MAXQ )

*  The number of op codes required to represent the quality expression.
*  ===================================================================
*  The quality expression is compiled, to produce a list of "operation
*  codes" describing the steps that must be performed to evaluate the
*  expression. This is the number of steps in the process.
      INTEGER QCM_NOPC( IRQ__MAXQ )

*  QEXP array locator.
*  ===================
*  The locator to the array of structures holding compiled quality
*  expressions. Each QEXP structure is one cell of this array.
      CHARACTER QCM_LOC*( DAT__SZLOC )

*  QEXP structure locators.
*  ========================
*  This array holds the HDS locators to each individual compiled
*  quality expression structure.
      CHARACTER QCM_LOCQ( IRQ__MAXQ )*( DAT__SZLOC )

*  Locators to QEXP components.
*  ============================
*  Each QEXP structure has 2 primative array components, called MASKS
*  and OPCODES. These hold the masks and op codes described above.
      CHARACTER QCM_LOCMS( IRQ__MAXQ )*( DAT__SZLOC )
      CHARACTER QCM_LOCOP( IRQ__MAXQ )*( DAT__SZLOC )

*  Pointers to mapped arrays.
*  ==========================
*  The 2 array components of each QEXP structure are kept permanently
*  mapped (until the IRQ identifier is annulled).
      INTEGER QCM_MSPNT( IRQ__MAXQ )
      INTEGER QCM_OPPNT( IRQ__MAXQ )

*  State of the IRQ system.
*  =======================
*  This character scalar is used to indicate that IRQ has been
*  initialised. On initialisation, it is set to the value of the
*  symbolic constant IRQ__GOING. When IRQ is closed it is set to a
*  blank value.
      CHARACTER QCM_STATE*( IRQ__SZSTA )

*  Which slots have been used.
*  ==========================
*  Each element of this array is .TRUE. if the corresponding element of
*  the other arrays holds information describing a currently defined
*  compiled quality expression.
      LOGICAL QCM_VALID( IRQ__MAXQ )




*  Declare the common block /IRQ_CMI/, to hold integer variables.
      COMMON /IRQ_CMI/ QCM_NMASK, QCM_MXSTK, QCM_NOPC, QCM_MSPNT,
     :                 QCM_OPPNT, QCM_INDF

*  Declare the common block /IRQ_CML/, to hold logical variables.
      COMMON /IRQ_CML/ QCM_VALID

*  Declare the common block /IRQ_CMC/, to hold character variables.
      COMMON /IRQ_CMC/ QCM_LOC, QCM_LOCQ, QCM_LOCMS, QCM_LOCOP,
     :                 QCM_STATE
