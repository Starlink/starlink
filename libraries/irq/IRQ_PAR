*  Type of Module:
*     Global constants include file.

*  component corresponding to the quality name.
      CHARACTER IRQ__BTNAM*3
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__BTNAM = 'BIT' )

*  The name of the component (of the temporary structure returned by
*  IRQ_FIND and IRQ_NEW) which holds a cloned NDF identifier for the
*  NDF containing the quality names information.
      CHARACTER IRQ__CINAM*14
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__CINAM = 'IRQ_CLONED_NDF' )

*  The name of the QUAL component which holds a descriptive comment.
      CHARACTER IRQ__CMNAM*7
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__CMNAM = 'COMMENT' )

      CHARACTER IRQ__RONAM*8
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__RONAM = 'READONLY' )

*  The name of the QUAL component that holds a flag indicating if the
*  bit number is fixed.
      CHARACTER IRQ__FBNAM*9
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__FBNAM = 'FIXED_BIT' )

*  The name of the QUAL component which indicates if the quality is
*  the same for all pixels, or varies from pixel to pixel.
      CHARACTER IRQ__FXNAM*5
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__FXNAM = 'FIXED' )

*  The name of the QUALITY_NAMES component holding a list of indices
*  of free slots.
      CHARACTER IRQ__FRNAM*4
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__FRNAM = 'FREE' )

*  String used to indicate that the IRQ_ system has been initialised.
*  This value is assigned to common variable QCM_STATE when IRQ_ is
*  initialised.
      CHARACTER IRQ__GOING*9
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__GOING = 'IRQ GOING' )

*  The number of new slots introduced each time the QUALITY_NAMES
*  structure becomes full. Each slot can hold the definition of a single
*  quality name.
      INTEGER IRQ__INCQ
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__INCQ = IRQ__QBITS )

*  The name of the QUALITY_NAMES component holding the index of
*  the last used slot.
      CHARACTER IRQ__LUNAM*9
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__LUNAM = 'LAST_USED' )

*  The size of the common arrays. This is the limit on the number of
*  compiled quality expressions which can be used by an application at
*  once.
      INTEGER IRQ__MAXQ
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__MAXQ = 10 )

*  The highest integer representing an instruction in the IRQ logical
*  instruction set.
      INTEGER IRQ__MXINS
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__MXINS = 17 )

*  The name of the QUALITY_NAMES component holding the number of
*  free slots.
      CHARACTER IRQ__NFNAM*5
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__NFNAM = 'NFREE' )

*  The name of the QUAL component holding the quality name.
      CHARACTER IRQ__NMNAM*4
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__NMNAM = 'NAME' )

*  An illegal IRQ_ identifier value. This value can sometimes be
*  specified by an application in place of an IRQ_ identifier in order
*  to supress some operation.
      INTEGER IRQ__NOID
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__NOID = 0 )

*  The maximum number of symbols that can be contained in a quality
*  expression.
      INTEGER IRQ__NSYMS

*  in a quality expression.

*  about all the quality name.
      CHARACTER IRQ__QUNAM*4
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__QUNAM = 'QUAL' )

*  about all the quality name.

*  A string used to replace a quality name when the name is removed
*  from the NDF.
      CHARACTER IRQ__SFREE*13
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__SFREE = 'IRQ_FREE_SLOT' )

*  Maximum length of descriptive comments stored with each quality name.
      INTEGER IRQ__SZCOM
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__SZCOM = 50 )

*  Maximum length of a quality expression.
      INTEGER IRQ__SZQEX
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__SZQEX = 255 )

*  Maximum length of a quality name.
      INTEGER IRQ__SZQNM
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__SZQNM = 15 )

*  Length of the string given by parameter IRQ__GOING.
      INTEGER IRQ__SZSTA
      PARAMETER ( IRQ__SZSTA = 9 )

*  IRQ_FIND and IRQ_NEW) which holds a copy of the locator to the
*  QUALITY_NAMES structure.
      CHARACTER IRQ__TQNAM*11
