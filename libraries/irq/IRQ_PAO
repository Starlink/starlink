*  Name:
*     IRQ_PAO

*  Purpose:
*     Defines scalar parameters describing the logical operators
*     available within IRQ.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Description:
*     Parameters are defined which describe the logical operations 
*     which can be used to evaluate the quality expression.
*     
*     LDQ tests a single bit from a QUALITY value, and puts TRUE on the
*     evaluation stack if the bit is set, and FALSE otherwise. The bit
*     to be tested is defined by the next mask in an array of masks.
*
*     RET signals the end of the calculation. The value on the top of 
*     the evaluation stack is returned as the expressions value.
*
*     LDF puts the value FALSE on the top of the evaluation stack.
*
*     LDT puts the value TRUE on the top of the evaluation stack.
*
*     CLS represents the end of a nesting level (eg a closing 
*     parenthesis). This has no effect on the evaluation stack.
*
*     OPN represents the start of a nesting level (eg an opening
*     parenthesis). This has no effect on the evaluation stack.
*
*     EQV removes two values from the evaluation stack. If they are the
*     same, the value TRUE is put back on the stack. Otherwise, the
*     value FALSE is put back on the stack.
*
*     XOR removes two values from the evaluation stack. If they are 
*     different, the value TRUE is put back on the stack. Otherwise, the
*     value FALSE is put back on the stack.
*
*     OR removes two values from the evaluation stack. If either one is
*     TRUE, the value TRUE is put back on the stack. Otherwise, the
*     value FALSE is put back on the stack.
*
*     AND removes two values from the evaluation stack. If they are both
*     true, the value TRUE is put back on the stack. Otherwise, the
*     value FALSE is put back on the stack.
*
*     NOT removes one value from the evaluation stack. If it is TRUE, 
*     the value FALSE is put back on the stack. Otherwise, the value 
*     TRUE is put back on the stack.
*
*     LDQE tests two bits from a QUALITY value, and puts TRUE on the
*     evaluation stack if both bits are in the same state, and FALSE 
*     otherwise. The bits to be tested are defined by the next mask in
*     an array of masks.
*
*     LDQX tests two bits from a QUALITY value, and puts FALSE on the
*     evaluation stack if both bits are in the same state, and TRUE
*     otherwise. The bits to be tested are defined by the next mask in
*     an array of masks.
*
*     LDQO tests any number of bits from a QUALITY value, and puts TRUE
*     on the evaluation stack if any bits are set, and FALSE otherwise.
*     The bits to be tested are defined by the next mask in an array of
*     masks.
*
*     LDQA tests any number of bits from a QUALITY value, and puts TRUE
*     on the evaluation stack if all bits are set, and FALSE otherwise.
*     The bits to be tested are defined by the next mask in an array of 
*     masks.
*
*     LDQN tests a single bit from a QUALITY value, and puts FALSE on 
*     the evaluation stack if the bit is set, and TRUE otherwise. The 
*     bit to be tested is defined by the next mask in an array of 
*     masks.
*
*     NULL does nothing. The evaluation stack is uneffected.
