/* Subroutine:  ioc_close (chan, status)

*  Name:
*     IOC_CLOSE

*  Purpose:
*     Close a magnetic tape device

*  Language:
*    ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IOC_CLOSE( CHAN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Invokes the low level close function to close the channel specified
*     by chan. It does its best to close the tape even if the input
*     status is bad. It returns the status of the close operation if it
*     produced an error; otherwise it returns the input status.
*     In practice its main effect is to release the i/o channel number
*     for re-use.

* Arguments:
*     CHAN = INTEGER (Given)
*        A small integer generated by ioc_open which identifies the specific
*        i/o channel being used.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The Global status.

*  Notes:
*     It appears that some device drivers on some platforms automatically
*     write an end-of-tape mark when closing a tape which was opened
*     for writing. It is therefore not a good idea, for example, to
*     rewind a tape before closing it, as the result is to put an EOT
*     at the start of the tape!

* Arguments:

*     ACMODE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        A word starting with r or R will cause the tape to be opened

*        One way of defining this is to use the function LEN in the

*  Name:

*  Purpose:
*     Write an End-of-File mark (or Tape Mark) on a magnetic tape device.

*  Language:
*    ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL IOC_WEOF( CHAN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Uses a Unix system ioctl to write an end-of-file mark (sometimes
*     called a tape mark) on to a magnetic tape.

* Arguments:
*     CHAN = INTEGER (Given)
*        A small integer generated by ioc_open which identifies the specific
*        i/o channel being used.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The Global status.

*  Notes:
*     An end-of-file is indistinguishable from a zero length record and will
*     be read as such by ioc_read.
