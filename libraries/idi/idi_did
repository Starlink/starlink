*  Name:
*     IDI_DID
*
*  Purpose:
*     Common block for display identifiers at FORTRAN interface level.
*
*  Description:
*     As each device driver uses its own assignment for display
*     identifiers, the top-level FORTRAN interface needs another
*     layer of identifiers to ensure that they are unique.

*  Global constants:

*   Define the integer identifiers for all the supported devices
      INTEGER D_IKON, D_XWIN
      PARAMETER ( D_IKON = 3200 )
      PARAMETER ( D_XWIN = 3800 )

*   Define the maximum number of devices available
      INTEGER NUMIDS
      PARAMETER ( NUMIDS = 8 )

*  Global variables:

*   Array storage for the device types.
      INTEGER DTYPE( NUMIDS )

*   Array storage for the display identifiers returned from the
*   seperate device drivers
      INTEGER DEVID( NUMIDS )
