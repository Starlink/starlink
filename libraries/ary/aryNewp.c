*  Name:
*     aryNewp

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new primitive array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryNewp( const char *ftype, int ndim, const hdsdim *ubnd,
*                   AryPlace **place, Ary **ary, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new primitive array and returns an
*     identifier for it. The array may subsequently be manipulated with
*     other Ary routines.

*  Parameters:
*     ftype
*        Data type of the array (e.g. '_REAL'). Note that complex types
*        are not allowed for primitive arrays.
*     ndim
*        Number of array dimensions.
*     ubnd
*        Upper pixel-index bounds of the array (the lower bound of each
*        dimension is taken to be 1).
*     place
*        On entry, holds an array placeholder (e.g. generated by the
*        aryPlace function) which indicates the position in the data
*        system where the new array will reside. The placeholder is
*        annulled by this function, and a value of NULL will be returned
*        on exit.
*     ary
*         Returned holding an identifier for the new array.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If this routine is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NULL will be returned for the "ary" argument, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be
*     returned if the routine should fail for any reason. In either
*     event, the placeholder will still be annulled.
