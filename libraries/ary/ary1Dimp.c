void ary1Dimp( HDSLoc *loc, AryDCB **dcb, int *status ) {
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ary1Dimp

*  Purpose:
*     Import a data object, creating a new DCB entry for it.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Dimp( HDSLoc *loc, AryDCB **dcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine imports an array structure into the ARY_ system,
*     creating a new DCB entry for it.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        HDS locator to the array structure to be imported.
*     dcb
*        Address of a variable in which to return a pointer to the new DCB.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  The routine makes a "cloned" copy of the HDS locator supplied;
*     the latter may later be annulled without affecting the operation
*     of the ARY_ system.
*     -  If STATUS is set on entry, then the routine will return a
*     value of NULL for the DCB pointer, although no further
*     processing will occur.
*     -  A value of NULL will also be returned if the routine fails.
