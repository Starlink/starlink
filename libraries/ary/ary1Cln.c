void ary1Cln( AryACB *acb1, AryACB **acb2, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     ary1Cln

*  Purpose:
*     Clone an ACB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Cln( AryACB *acb1, AryACB **acb2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function "clones" an ACB, producing a new ACB which is
*     a duplicate of the original (except that it is not mapped for
*     access if the original was). The data object reference count in
*     the DCB is incremented by one.

*  Parameters:
*     iacb1
*        The ACB entry to be cloned.
*     iacb2
*        The new ACB entry.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     The DCB mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  If "status" is set on entry, then a value of NULL will be
*     returned for the "acb2" argument, although no further processing
*     will occur.
*     -  A value of NULL will also be returned for the "acb2" argument if
*     the routine fails for any reason.
