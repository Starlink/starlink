void ary1Bad( AryACB *acb, int check, int *bad, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     ary1Bad

*  Purpose:
*     Determine whether bad pixels may be present for an ACB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Bad( AryACB *acb, int check, int *bad, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function obtains the value of the bad pixel flag for an array
*     with an entry in the ACB, taking account of the possibility that
*     the array may be mapped for access. If requested, an explicit
*     check on the presence of bad pixels will be made.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Index to the array entry in the ACB.
*     check
*        If "check" is set to zero, then the routine will simply return
*        the value of the bad pixel flag (indicating whether bad pixels
*        may be present in the array). If "check" is set non-zero, then an
*        explicit check will be performed if necessary, to see if bad
*        values are actually present in the data.
*     bad
*        Returned holding the bad pixel flag value.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.
