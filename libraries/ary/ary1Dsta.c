void ary1Dsta( AryDCB *dcb, int *status ) {
/*

*  Name:
*     ary1Dsta

*  Purpose:
*     Ensure that state information is available for a data object.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Dsta( AryDCB *dcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine ensures that information about the state (i.e.
*     defined or undefined) of an array is available. It does nothing
*     if the state information is already available in the DCB.
*     Otherwise, it obtains this information by inspecting the data
*     object itself, storing the result in the DCB. Only those checks
*     needed for obtaining the state information are performed on the
*     data object.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the DCB.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.
