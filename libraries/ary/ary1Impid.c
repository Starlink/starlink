*  Name:
*     ary1Impid

*  Purpose:
*     Import an identifier.

*  Synopsis:
*     AryObject *ary1Impid( const void *id, int checklock, int readonly,
*                           const int isacb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine converts an array identifier, previously issued by
*     ary1Expid into a pointer to the appropriate ACB structure.
*     The identifier value is fully checked and an error is reported if
*     it is not valid.

*  Parameters:
*     id
*        An identifier for the object to be imported, in the form of an
*        Ary or AryPlace pointer as issued by ary1Expid.
*     checklock
*        If non-zero, check that the supplied identifier is locked
*        appropriately by the current thread.
*     readonly
*        Only used if "checklock" is non-zero, in which case it gives
*        the type of lock required; read-only if non-zero, and read-write
*        if zero.
*     isacb
*        If non-zero, the supplied object is expected to be an ACB.
*        Otherwise it is expected to be a PCB.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Returned function value:
*     Pointer to the ACB or PCB structure, cast to an AryObject,
*     or NULL if an error occurs.
