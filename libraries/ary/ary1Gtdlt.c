*  Name:
*     ary1Gtdlt

*  Purpose:
*     Get the compressed axis and data type for a DELTA array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Gtdlt( AryDCB *dcb, int *zaxis, char ztype[DAT__SZTYP+1],
*                     float *zratio, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the details of the compression used to produce
*     an array stored in DELTA form. If the array is not stored in
*     DELTA form, then null values are returned as listed below, but no
*     error is reported.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        The data object (DCB).
*     zaxis
*        Returned holding the index of the pixel axis along which compression
*        occurred. The first axis has index 1. Zero is returned if the array
*        is not stored in DELTA form.
*     ztype
*        Returned holding the data type in which the differences between
*        adjacent array values are stored. This will be one of '_BYTE',
*        '_WORD' or '_INTEGER'. The data type of the array itself is returned
*        if the supplid array is not stored in DELTA form.
*     zratio
*        Returned holding the compression factor - the ratio of the
*        uncompressed array size to the compressed array size. This is
*        approximate as it does not include the effects of the metadata
*        needed to describe the extra components of a DELTA array (i.e. the
*        space needed to hold the component names, types, dimensions, etc).
*        A value of 1.0 is returned if the supplid array is not stored in
*        DELTA form.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.
