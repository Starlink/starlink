*  Name:
*     arySbnd

*  Purpose:
*     Set new pixel-index bounds for an array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void arySbnd( int ndim, const hdsdim *lbnd, const hdsdim *ubnd,
*                   Ary *ary, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets new pixel-index bounds for an array (or array
*     section). The number of array dimensions may also be changed.  If
*     a base array is specified, then a permanent change is made to the
*     actual data object and this will be apparent through any other
*     array identifiers which refer to it.  However, if an identifier
*     for an array section is specified, then its bounds are altered
*     without affecting other arrays.

*  Parameters:
*     ndim
*        New number of array dimensions.
*     lbnd
*        Array holding the new lower pixel-index bounds of the array.
*     ubnd
*        Array holding the new upper pixel-index bounds of the array.
*     ary
*        Array identifier.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The bounds of an array section cannot be altered while it is
*     mapped for access through the identifier supplied to this
*     routine.
*     -  The bounds of a base array cannot be altered while any part of
*     it is mapped for access (i.e. even through another identifier).
*     -  The array's pixel values (if defined) will be retained for
*     those pixels which lie within both the old and new bounds. Any
*     pixels lying outside the new bounds will be lost (and cannot
*     later be recovered by further changes to the array's bounds).
*     Any new pixels introduced where the new bounds extend beyond the
*     old ones will be assigned the "bad" value, and the subsequent
*     value of the bad-pixel flag will reflect this.
*     -  If the bounds of a base array are to be altered and retention
*     of the existing pixel values is not required, then a call to
*     aryReset should be made before calling this routine. This will
*     eliminate any processing which might otherwise be needed to
*     retain the existing values. This step is not necessary with an
*     array section, where no processing of pixel values takes place.
