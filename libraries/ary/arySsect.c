void arySsect( Ary *ary1, Ary *ary2, Ary **ary3, int *status ) {
/*

*  Name:
*     arySsect

*  Purpose:
*     Create a similar array section to an existing one.

*  Synopsis:
*     void arySsect( Ary *ary1, Ary *ary2, Ary **ary3, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new array section, using an existing
*     section as a template. The new section bears the same
*     relationship to its base array as the template section does to
*     its own base array. Allowance is made for pixel-index shifts
*     which may have been applied so that the pixel-indices of the new
*     section match those of the template.  The number of dimensions of
*     the input and template arrays may differ.

*  Parameters:
*     ary1
*        Identifier for the input array from which the section is to be
*        derived. This may be a base array or an array section.
*     ary2
*        Identifier for the template section (this may also be a base
*        array or an array section).
*     ary3
*        Returned holding the identifier for the new array section.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the supplied array is locked read-only by the current thread
*     an attempt will be made to promote the lock to a read-write lock
*     and an error will be reported if this attempt fails. This promotion
*     is necessary because the meta-data associated with the cut (e.g.
*     pixel shift etc) can be modified using the returned identifier.
*     -  This routine normally generates an array section.  However, if
*     both input arrays are base arrays with identical pixel-index
*     bounds, then there is no need to create a section in order to
*     access the required part of the first array. In this case a base
*     array identifier will be returned instead.
*     -  The new section created by this routine will have the same
*     number of dimensions as the array (or array section) from which
*     it is derived. If the template (ary2) array has fewer dimensions
*     than this, then the bounds of any additional input dimensions are
*     preserved unchanged in the new array. If the template (ary2)
*     array has more dimensions, then the excess ones are ignored.
*     -  This routine takes account of the regions of each base array
*     to which the input array sections have access. It may therefore
*     restrict the region accessible to the new section (and pad with
*     "bad" pixels) so as not to grant access to regions of the base
*     array which were not previously accessible through the input
*     arrays.
*     -  If this routine is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NULL will be returned for the "ary3" argument, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be
*     returned if the routine should fail for any reason.
