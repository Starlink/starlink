void ary1Stp( const char *type, int cmplx, AryACB *acb, int *status ) {
/*

*  Name:
*     ary1Stp

*  Purpose:
*     Set a new data type for an array identified by its ACB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Stp( const char *type, int cmplx, AryACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function changes the data type of an array identified by its
*     entry in the ACB. If the array's state is "defined", then the
*     data it contains undergo type conversion, otherwise no conversion
*     is necessary. Conversions from non-complex to complex data types
*     (and vice versa) are handled.

*  Parameters:
*     type
*        The new numeric data type for the array; a primitive numeric
*        HDS data type string (case insensitive).
*     cmplx
*        Whether the new data type is to be complex.
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine has no effect if the array is not a base array.

*  Side Effects:
*     -  The array's bad pixel flag may be set if data conversion
*     errors occur.
