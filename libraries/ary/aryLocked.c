*  Name:
*     aryLocked

*  Purpose:
*     See if an array is locked.

*  Synopsis:
*     locked = aryLocked( const Ary *ary, int *status );

*  Description:
*     This function returns a value that indicates if the supplied ARY
*     array has been locked for use by one or more threads. A thread can
*     lock an array either for read-only access or for read-write access.
*     The lock management functions (aryLock and aryUnlock) will ensure
*     that any thread that requests and is given a read-write lock will
*     have exclusive access to the array - no other locks of either type
*     will be issued to other threads until the first thread releases the
*     read-write lock using aryUnlock. If a thread requests and is given
*     a read-only lock, the lock management functions may issue read-only
*     locks to other threads, but it will also ensure that no other thread
*     is granted a read-write lock until all read-only locks have been
*     released.

*  Parameters:
*     ary
*        Pointer to the array to be checked.
*     status
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned function value:
*     A value indicating the status of the supplied array:
*
*    -1: The application is is linked with a version of HDS that does
*        not support object locking.
*
*     0: the supplied array is unlocked. This is the condition that must
*        be met for the current thread to be able to lock the supplied
*        array for read-write access using function aryLock. This condition
*        can be achieved by releasing any existing locks using aryUnlock.
*
*     1: the supplied array is locked for reading and writing by the current
*        thread. This is the condition that must be met for the current
*        thread to be able to use the supplied array in any ARY function
*        that might modify the array (except for the locking and unlocking
*        functions - see below). This condition can be achieved by calling
*        aryLock.
*
*     2: the supplied array is locked for reading and writing by a different
*        thread. An error will be reported if the current thread attempts to
*        use the array in any other ARY function.
*
*     3: the supplied array is locked read-only by the current thread (and
*        maybe other threads as well). This is the condition that must be
*        met for the current thread to be able to use the supplied array
*        in any ARY function that cannot modify the array. An error will be
*        reported if the current thread attempts to use the array in any
*        ARY function that could modify the array. This condition can be
*        achieved by calling aryLock.
*
*     4: the supplied array is not locked by the current thread, but is
*        locked read-only by one or more other threads. An error will be
*        reported if the current thread attempts to use the array in any
*        other ARY function.

*  Notes:
*     - Zero is returned as the function value if an error has already
*     occurred, or if an error occurs in this function.
