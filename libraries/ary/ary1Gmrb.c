*  Name:
*     ary1Gmrb

*  Purpose:
*     Get mapping region bounds.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Gmrb( AryACB *acb, int *mtrex, int *mrfull, int *whole,
*                    hdsdim lmrb[ ARY__MXDIM ], hdsdim umrb[ ARY__MXDIM ],
*                    hdsdim lmtr[ ARY__MXDIM ], hdsdim umtr[ ARY__MXDIM ],
*                    int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine determines the extent of the mapping region
*     associated with access to all or part of an array. It also
*     determines whether a mapping transfer region exists, whether it
*     fills the mapping region and whether the whole of the data object
*     should be mapped. The results are returned using the pixel index
*     system of the actual data object.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB for which mapping region information is required.
*     mtrex
*        Returned holding a flag indicating whether a mapping transfer
*        region exists.
*     mrfull
*        Returned holding a flag indicating whether the mapping transfer
*        region completely fills the mapping region.
*     whole
*        Returned holding a flag indicating whether the mapping transfer
*        region and mapping region both consist of the entire data object,
*        indicating that the entire object can be mapped.
*     lmrb
*        An array that is returned holding the lower mapping region bounds.
*     umrb
*        An array that is returned holding the upper mapping region bounds.
*     lmtr
*        An array that is returned holding the lower bounds of mapping transfer
*        region.
*     umtr
*        An array that is returned holding the upper bounds of mapping transfer
*        region.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.
