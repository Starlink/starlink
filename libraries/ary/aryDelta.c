*  Name:
*     aryDelta

*  Purpose:
*     Compress an array using delta compression.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryDelta( Ary *ary1, int zaxis, const char *type, float minrat,
*                    AryPlace **place, float *zratio, Ary **ary2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a copy of the supplied array stored in DELTA form,
*     which provides a lossless compression scheme for integer data. This
*     scheme assumes that adjacent integer values in the input array tend
*     to be close in value, and so differences between adjacent values can
*     be represented in fewer bits than the absolute values themselves.
*     The differences are taken along a nominated pixel axis within the
*     supplied array (specified by argument ZAXIS).
*
*     In practice, the scheme is limited currently to representing differences
*     between adjacent values using a HDS integer data type (specified by
*     argyument TYPE) - that is, arbitrary bit length is not yet supported.
*     So for instance an _INTEGER input array can be compressed by storing
*     differences as _WORD or _BYTE values, but a _WORD input array can only
*     be compressed by storing differences as _BYTE values.
*
*     Any input value that differs from its earlier neighbour by more than
*     the data range of the selected data type is stored explicitly using
*     the data type of the input array.
*
*     Further compression is achieved by replacing runs of equal input values
*     by a single occurrence of the value with a correspsonding repetition
*     count.
*
*     It should be noted that the degree of compression achieved is
*     dependent on the nature of the data, and it is possible for the
*     compressed array to occupy more space than the uncompressed array.
*     The compression factor actually achieved is returned in argument
*     "zratio" (the ratio of the supplied array size to the compressed
*     array size). A minmum allowed compression ratio may be specified via
*     argument "minrat". If the compression ratio is less than this value,
*     then the returned copy is left uncompressed.

*  Parameters:
*     ary1
*        The input array identifier. This can be stored in any form. If
*        it is already stored in DELTA form, it is uncompressed and then
*        re-compressed using the supplied compression parameters. If
*        is is stored in SCALED form, the internal integer values are
*        compressed and the scale and zero terms are copied into the
*        DELTA array.
*     zaxis
*        The one-based index of the pixel axis along which differences are
*        to be taken. If this is zero, a default value will be selected that
*        gives the greatest compression. An error will be reported if a
*        value less than zero or greater than the number of axes in the
*        input array is supplied.
*     type
*        The data type in which to store the differences between adjacent
*        input values. This must be one of '_BYTE', '_WORD' or
*        '_INTEGER'. Additionally, a blank string may be supplied in which
*        case a default value will be selected that gives the greatest
*        compression.
*     minrat
*        The minimum allowed ZRATIO value. If compressing the input array
*        results in a ZRATIO value smaller than or equal to MINRAT, then
*        the returned array is left uncompressed. If the supplied value is
*        zero or negative, then the array will be compressed regardless of
*        the compression ratio.
*     place
*        Address of an array placeholder pointer (e.g. generated by the
*        aryPlace function), which indicates the position in the data system
*        where the new array will reside. The placeholder is annulled by this
*        function, and a value of NULL will be returned.
*     zratio
*        Returned holding the compression factor actually achieved (the ratio
*        of the supplied array size to the compressed array size). Genuine
*        compressions are represented by values more than 1.0, but values
*        less than 1.0 may be returned if the input data is not suited
*        to delta compression (i.e. if the "compression" actually expands
*        the array storage). Note, the returned value of ZRATIO may be
*        smaller than MINRAT, in which case the supplied array is left
*        unchanged. The returned compression factor is approximate as it
*        does not take into account the space occupied by the HDS metadata
*        describing the extra components of a DELTA array (i.e. the
*        component names, data types, dimensions, etc). This will only be
*        significant for very small arrays.
*     ary2
*        Returned holding a pointer to the new DELTA array.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - An error will be reported if the supplied array does not hold
*     integer values. In the case of a SCALED array, the internal
*     (scaled) values must be integers, but the external (unscaled) values
*     can be of any data type.
*     - The compression axis and compressed data type actually used can
*     be determined by passing the returned array to aryGtdlt.
*     -  An error will result if the array, or any part of it, is
*     currently mapped for access (e.g. through another identifier).
*     -  An error will result if the array holds complex values.
