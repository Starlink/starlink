void ary1Umps( AryACB *acb, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     ary1Umps

*  Purpose:
*     Unmap a simple array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Umps( AryACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine unmaps a simple array which has previously been
*     mapped for access and updates the associated data object
*     (including its mapping reference count and state if appropriate).
*     If the routine completes successfully, then the MCB slot used for
*     the mapping is released and the ACB entry is marked as no longer
*     being mapped.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine attempts to execute even if STATUS is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB and ACB mutexes must be locked.
*     -  This routine should only be called for an ACB entry which has
*     previously been used to obtain mapped access to an array and has
*     not since been unmapped.

*  Side Effects:
*     -  Write-back of data by this routine may affect the data values
*     which are accessed via other ACB entries, where the associated
*     arrays refer to the same data object and overlap spatially.
*     -  If data conversion errors occur during write-back of data,
*     then the data object bad pixel flag may be updated (if a mapping
*     transfer region exists). This may affect other ACB entries where
*     the associated arrays refer to the same data object and overlap
*     with the affected data region.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine may also be used for unmapping primitive arrays.
