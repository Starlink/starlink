*  Name:
*     aryVerfy

*  Purpose:
*     Verify that an array's data structure is correctly constructed.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryVerfy( Ary *ary, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function checks that the data structure containing an array is
*     correctly constructed and that the array's pixel values are
*     defined. It also checks for the presence of any "rogue"
*     components in the data structure. If an anomaly is found, then an
*     error results. Otherwise, the routine returns without further
*     action.

*  Parameters:
*     ary
*        Array identifier.
*     status
*        The global status.
