AryACB *ary1Anl( AryACB *acb, int *status ) {
/*

*  Name:
*     ary1Anl

*  Purpose:
*     Annul an array specified by an ACB.

*  Synopsis:
*     AryACB *ary1Anl( AryACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine annuls an array specified by its ACB. If the array is
*     currently mapped for access through this ACB, then it is first
*     unmapped. The ACB is then annulled. If, as a result, the
*     reference count for the associated data object drops to zero,
*     then the object will be released from the ARY_ system and may be
*     deleted, according to its disposal mode.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Returned function value:
*     A NULL pointer is always returned.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -   The DCB and ACB mutexes must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine attempts to execute even if 'status' is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
