*  Name:
*     ary1Upsw

*  Purpose:
*     Unmap simple array component mapped for WRITE (or UPDATE) access.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Upsw( AryACB *acb, const char *type, int bad, int copy,
*                    HDSLoc *datloc, HDSLoc **mloc, void **pntr, int *dce,
*                    int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine unmaps a component of a simple array which has
*     previously been mapped for WRITE (or UPDATE) access. This causes
*     the mapped data lying within the mapping transfer region (if it
*     exists) to be written back into the actual data object and
*     associated memory locations to be released.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB.
*     type
*        The data type used for mapped access; a primitive numeric HDS
*        type string (case insensitive).
*     bad
*        Whether to check for "bad" values when performing data type
*        conversion on data lying within the mapping transfer region.
*     copy
*        Whether mapped access is via a "copy" of the data; this
*        indicates whether or not the locator 'mloc' is associated with a
*        temporary object.
*     datloc
*        HDS locator to the actual data object component into which
*        data should be written back if this is necessary.
*     mloc
*        Address of a locator to the HDS object mapped to provide memory
*        locations for the mapped data. This locator will be annulled and
*        reset to NULL by this routine. If it is associated with a
*        temporary object, then this will be erased.
*     pntr
*        Address of a pointer to the mapped data; the pointer is reset to
*        NULL by this routine.
*     dce
*        Address of a flag that is returned indicating whether any data
*        conversion errors occurred.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine attempts to execute even if 'status' is set on
*     entry, although no additional error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
*     -  No ACB or MCB structures are updated by this routine.
