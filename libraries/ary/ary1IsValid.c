*  Name:
*     ary1IsValid

*  Purpose:
*     Checks that the supplied object (DCB, ACB, MCB or PCB) is valid.

*  Synopsis:
*     int ary1IsValid( AryObject *object, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine returns a flag indicating if the supplied object
*     (DCB, ACB, MCB or PCB) is valid.

*  Parameters:
*     object
*        Pointer to the object to check. It should be of type AryDCB,
*        AryACB, AryMCB or AryPCB.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Returned function value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if the supplied object is valid, and
*     zero if it is invalid.

*  Notes:
*     -  No error is reported if the supplied object is not valid.
