void ary1Chmod( AryACB *acb, const char *mode, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     ary1Chmod

*  Purpose:
*     Check that the requested array mapping access mode is permitted.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Chmod( AryACB *acb, const char *mode, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function checks that the requested mapping access mode is
*     permitted for an array. If it is not, then an error will be
*     reported. An error will also reported if the access mode string
*     supplied is not valid.  Otherwise the routine returns without
*     further action.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        The ACB.
*     mode
*        The requested access mode; one of "READ", "WRITE" or "UPDATE"
*        (case insensitive).
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.
