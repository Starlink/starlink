*  Name:
*     aryLoc

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain an HDS locator for an array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryLoc( Ary *ary, HDSLoc **loc, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns an HDS locator for the data object referred to
*     by the supplied ARY identifier.

*  Parameters:
*     ary
*        Array identifier.
*     loc
*        Returned holding the HDS locator. It should be annulled using
*        datAnnul when no longer needed. A value of NULL will be returned
*        if an error occurs.
*     status
*        The global status.
