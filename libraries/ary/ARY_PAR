*  Name:
*     ARY_PAR

*  Purpose:
*     Define public global constants for the ARY_ system.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global constants include file.

*  Description:
*     This file contains definitions of global constants which are used
*     by the ARY_ system and which may also be needed by software which
*     calls routines from this system.

*  History:
*     22-SEP-1989 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     16-JAN-1990 (RFWS):
*        Changed the value of the ARY__SZMMD constant to allow
*        initialisation modes to appear on all access types.
*     7-MAR-1990 (RFWS):
*        Increased the value of the ARY__SZFTP constant in anticipation
*        of future development involving scaled arrays.

*-

*  Global Constants:

*  General.
*  =======

*  Maximum number of array dimensions.
      INTEGER ARY__MXDIM
      PARAMETER ( ARY__MXDIM = 7 )

*  Value which is never used as an array identifier, to which an
*  invalid identifier may be set.
      INTEGER ARY__NOID
      PARAMETER ( ARY__NOID = 0 )

*  Value which is never used as an array placeholder, to which an
*  invalid placeholder may be set.
      INTEGER ARY__NOPL
      PARAMETER ( ARY__NOPL = 0 )

*  String lengths.
*  ==============

*  Maximum size of a string describing an array access type, e.g.
*  'DELETE'.
      INTEGER ARY__SZACC
      PARAMETER ( ARY__SZACC = 6 )

*  Maximum length of a string describing an array's "form", e.g.
*  'SIMPLE'.
      INTEGER ARY__SZFRM
      PARAMETER ( ARY__SZFRM = 10 )

*  Maximum length of a string describing the full type of an array
*  (including whether it is complex), e.g. 'COMPLEX_REAL'.
      INTEGER ARY__SZFTP
      PARAMETER ( ARY__SZFTP = 20 )

*  Maximum length of a string describing the "mapping mode" used to map
*  an array for access, e.g. 'WRITE/ZERO'.
      INTEGER ARY__SZMMD
      PARAMETER ( ARY__SZMMD = 11 )

*  Maximum length of a string describing an array's numeric type, e.g.
*  '_INTEGER'.
      INTEGER ARY__SZTYP
      PARAMETER ( ARY__SZTYP = 8 )
