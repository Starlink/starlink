*  Name:
*     ary1Mpsw

*  Purpose:
*     Map a simple array component for WRITE access.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Mpsw( AryACB *acb, HDSLoc *loc, const char *type,
*                    const char *inopt, HDSLoc **mloc,
*                    int *copy, void **pntr, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine maps a component (non-imaginary or imaginary) of a
*     simple array for WRITE access and returns a locator and a pointer
*     to the mapped data. The mapped data region may also be
*     initialised to zero or to "bad" values according to the value
*     supplied for the "inopt" argument.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB specifying the array whose data
*        are to be mapped.
*     loc
*        Locator to the array data component (non-imaginary or
*        imaginary) to be accessed.
*     type
*        The data type for access; an HDS primitive numeric data type
*        string (case insensitive).
*     inopt
*        The initialisation option; one of ' ', 'ZERO' or 'BAD' (case
*        insensitive).
*     mloc
*        Address at which to return a locator associated with the object
*        that is mapped to provide memory locations for the data.
*     copy
*        Address at which to return a boolean value indicating if the mapped
*        data region is a "copy" of the actual data (as opposed to being a
*        mapped slice of the data object itself).
*     pntr
*        Address at which to return a pointer to the mapped data.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine may also be used to map scaled or primitive arrays.

*  Prior requirements:
*     -  Appropriate entries relating to the region of data to be
*     mapped must already have been set up in the MCB before this
*     routine is called.
*     -  Type, bounds and dimensionality information for the data object
*     being mapped must already be available in the DCB.
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.
