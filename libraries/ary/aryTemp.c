*  Name:
*     aryTemp

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain a placeholder for a temporary array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryTemp( AryPlace **place, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns an array placeholder which may be used to
*     create a temporary array (i.e. one which will be deleted
*     automatically once the last identifier associated with it is
*     annulled). The placeholder returned by this routine may be passed
*     to other routines (e.g. aryNew or aryCopy) to produce a
*     temporary array in the same way as a new permanent array would be
*     created.

*  Parameters:
*     place
*        Returned holding a placeholder for a temporary array.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Placeholders are intended only for local use within an
*     application and only a limited number of them are available
*     simultaneously. They are always annulled as soon as they are
*     passed to another routine to create a new array, where they are
*     effectively exchanged for an array identifier.
*     -  If this routine is called with STATUS set, then a value of
*     NULL will be returned for the "place" argument, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be
*     returned if the routine should fail for any reason.
