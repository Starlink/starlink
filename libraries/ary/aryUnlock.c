*  Name:
*     aryUnlock

*  Purpose:
*     Unlock an array so that it can be locked by a different thread.

*  Synopsis:
*     aryUnlock( Ary *ary, int *status );

*  Description:
*     This function ensures that the current thread does not have a
*     lock of any type on the supplied array. See aryLock.
*
*     The array must be locked again, using aryLock, before it can
*     be used by any other ARY function. All arrays are initially
*     locked by the current thread when they are first created or
*     opened.

*  Parameters:
*     ary
*        Pointer to to the array to be unlocked.
*     status
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Notes:
*     - If the version of HDS being used does not support object locking,
*     this function will return without action unless the HDS tuning
*     parameter V4LOCKERROR is set to a non-zero value, in which case an
*     error will be reported.
*     - No error is reported if the supplied array is currently locked
*     for read-only or read-write access by another thread.
*     - The majority of ARY functions will report an error if the array
*     supplied to the function has not been locked for use by the calling
*     thread. The exceptions are the functions that manage these locks -
*     aryLock, aryUnlock and aryLocked.
*     - Attempting to unlock an array that is not locked by the current
*     thread has no effect, and no error is reported. The aryLocked
*     function can be used to determine if the current thread has a lock
*     on the array.
