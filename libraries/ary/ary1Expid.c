void *ary1Expid( AryObject *object, int *status ) {
/*

*  Name:
*     ary1Expid

*  Purpose:
*     Export an array identifier.

*  Synopsis:
*     void *ary1Expid( AryObject *object, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine converts a pointer to an ACB or PCB into an identifier
*     which can be issued to an application to refer to the ACB or PCB. The
*     identifier issued is saved in the ACB or PCB so that a check on its
*     validity can later be made.  Identifiers are encoded so that it is
*     extremely unlikely that two identical ones will ever be issued, even
*     if the ARY_ system is closed down completely and restarted (an
*     identifier which is still valid can, of course, never be duplicated).
*     This makes it possible to detect invalid identifiers and to report
*     problems with "dangling" identifier values if an application neglects
*     to annul them.

*  Parameters:
*     object
*        Pointer to the ACB or PCB.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Returned function value:
*     The returned array identifier, cast into the form of a pointer to
*     an "Ary" (if "object" is an ACB) or "AryPlace" (if "object" is a PCB)
*     structure. This is an opaque pointer that cannot be de-referenced
*     directly.

*  Notes:
*     -  If an error has already occurred, or if this function should
*     fail for any reason, a NULL pointer will be returned.
