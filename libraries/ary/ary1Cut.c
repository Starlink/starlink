*  Name:
*     ary1Cut

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain a cut from an existing array with an entry in the ACB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Cut( AryACB *acb1, int ndim, const hdsdim *lbnd,
*                   const hdsdim *ubnd, AryACB **acb2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function produces an ACB structure for a new array representing
*     a "cut" from an existing array (which may itself be a cut). The
*     bounds and dimensionality of the new array are specified in the
*     call to this function and the resulting array has access to a
*     subset (although possibly a null subset) of the data accessible
*     to the initial array from which it is derived. This accessible
*     region is determined by the new array's data transfer window,
*     which is formed from the intersection between the initial array's
*     data transfer window, the bounds of the initial array and the
*     bounds of the new array.

*  Parameters:
*     acb1
*        The ACB for an existing array.
*     ndim
*        Number of dimensions for the new cut. Also gives the length of
*        the lbnd and ubnd arrays.
*     lbnd
*        Lower dimension bounds for the cut.
*     ubnd
*        Upper dimension bounds for the cut.
*     acb2
*        Returned holding the ACB for the new cut.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -   The DCB and ACB mutexes must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the supplied array is locked read-only by the current thread
*     an attempt will be made to promote the lock to a read-write lock
*     and an error will be reported if this attempt fails. This promotion
*     is necessary because the meta-data associated with the cut (e.g.
*     pixel shift etc) can be modified using the returned identifier.
*     -  If "status" is set on entry, then a value of NULL will be
*     returned for the "acb2" argument, although no further processing
*     will occur.
*     -  A value of NULL will also be returned for the "acb2" argument if
*     the routine fails for any reason.
