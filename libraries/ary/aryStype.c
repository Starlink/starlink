void aryStype( const char *ftype, Ary *ary, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     aryStype

*  Purpose:
*     Set a new type for an array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryStype( const char *ftype, Ary *ary, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets a new full type for an array, causing its data
*     storage type to be changed. If the array's pixel values are
*     defined, then they will be converted from the old type to the new
*     one.  If they are undefined, then no conversion will be
*     necessary.  Subsequent enquiries will reflect the new type.
*     Conversion may be performed between any types supported by the
*     ary_ routines, including from a non-complex type to a complex
*     type (and vice versa).

*  Parameters:
*     ftype
*        The new full type specification for the array (e.g.  '_REAL'
*        or 'COMPLEX_INTEGER').
*     ary
*        Array identifier.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function may only be used to change the type of a base
*     array. If it is called with an array which is not a base array,
*     then it will return without action. No error will result.
*     -  An error will result if the array, or any part of it, is
*     currently mapped for access (e.g. through another identifier).
*     -  If the type of an array is to be changed without its pixel
*     values being retained, then a call to aryReset should be made
*     beforehand. This will avoid the cost of converting all the
*     values.
