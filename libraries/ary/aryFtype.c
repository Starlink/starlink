void aryFtype( Ary *ary,  char ftype[ARY__SZFTP+1], int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     aryFtype

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain the full data type of an array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryFtype( Ary *ary,  char ftype[ARY__SZFTP+1], int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the full data type of an array as an
*     upper-case character string (e.g. '_REAL' or 'COMPLEX_BYTE').

*  Parameters:
*     ary
*        Array identifier.
*     ftype
*        Returned holding the full data type of the array.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The symbolic constant ARY__SZFTP should be used for declaring the
*     length of a character variable to hold the full data type of an
*     array. This constant is defined in the header file ary.h.
*     - For "Scaled" arrays, the data type returned by this function is
*     the data type of the SCALE and ZERO terms, rather than the data
*     type of the stored array.
