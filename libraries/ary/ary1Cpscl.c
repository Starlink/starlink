*  Name:
*     ary1Cpscl

*  Purpose:
*     Copy scale information from one DCB entry to another.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Cpscl( AryDCB *dcb1, AryDCB *dcb2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function copies the information describing the scale and zero
*     terms for a supplied data array (identified by its DCB entry) to
*     another existing DCB entry.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb1
*        The DCB entry of the array to be copied.
*     dcb2
*        The DCB entry to recieve the copy.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.
