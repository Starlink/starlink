void ary1Dsft( int nshift, const hdsdim *shift, AryDCB *dcb, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     ary1Dsft

*  Purpose:
*     Apply pixel shifts to a data object entry in the DCB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Dsft( int nshift, const hdsdim *shift, AryDCB *dcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function applies a set of pixel shifts to a data object
*     identified by its index in the DCB. An integer shift is applied
*     to each dimension so that the array maintains the same data
*     content, although its bounds (and the indices of each pixel)
*     change by the amount of the shift applied to the corresponding
*     dimension. The DCB entry is updated to reflect the changes.

*  Parameters:
*     nshift
*        Number of dimensions to which shifts are to be applied (i.e. the
*        length of the "shift" array). If more shifts are specified than
*        there are dimensions in the data object, then the excess shifts
*        are disregarded. If fewer shifts are specified, then the extra
*        dimensions are not shifted.
*     shift
*        Array holding the shifts to be applied to each dimension.
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the DCB describing the data object to be shifted.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.
