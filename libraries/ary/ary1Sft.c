void ary1Sft( int nshift, const hdsdim *shift, AryACB *acb, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     ary1Sft

*  Purpose:
*     Apply pixel index shifts to an array entry in the ACB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Sft( int nshift, const hdsdim *shift, AryACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function applies a set of pixel index shifts to an array
*     identified by its entry in the ACB. An integer shift is applied
*     to each dimension so that the array maintains the same data
*     content, although its bounds (and the indices of each pixel)
*     change by the amount of the shift applied to the corresponding
*     dimension. If the array is not a base array, then only one entry
*     in the ACB is affected. If it is a base array, then the shifts
*     are applied to the actual data object and all ACB entries which
*     refer to that object are also updated to reflect the change.

*  Parameters:
*     nshift
*        Number of dimensions to which shifts are to be applied. If
*        more shifts are specified than there are dimensions in the
*        array, then the excess shifts are disregarded. If fewer shifts
*        are specified, then the extra dimensions are not shifted.
*     shift
*        Array holding the of shifts to be applied to each dimension.
*     acb
*        The array ACB.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  Note that applying a shift to a base array affects the pixel
*     indices of all other direct references to the same base array,
*     but does not affect the pixel indices of cuts derived from it
*     (these remain unchanged as regards both data content and pixel
*     indices).
*     -  Applying a shift to a cut always affects that array only.
