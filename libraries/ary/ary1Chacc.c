void ary1Chacc( AryACB *acb, const char *access, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     ary1Chacc

*  Purpose:
*     Check that a specified type of access to an ACB entry is
*     permitted.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Chacc( AryACB *acb, const char *access, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function checks that the specified type of access to an ACB
*     entry is permitted. If it is, then it returns without further
*     action, otherwise an error is reported.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        The ACB entry.
*     access
*        The type of access required (case insensitive).
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.
