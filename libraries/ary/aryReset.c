*  Name:
*     aryReset

*  Purpose:
*     Reset an array to an undefined state.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryReset( Ary *ary, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function resets an array so that its values become undefined.
*     Its use is advisable before making format changes to an array if
*     retention of the existing values is not required (e.g. before
*     changing its data type with the aryStype function); this will
*     avoid the cost of converting the existing values.

*  Parameters:
*     ary
*        Array identifier.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function may only be used to reset the state of a base
*     array. If an array section is supplied, then it will return
*     without action. No error will result.
*     -  An array cannot be reset while it is mapped for access. This
*     routine will fail if this is the case.
