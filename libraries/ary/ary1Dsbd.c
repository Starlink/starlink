void ary1Dsbd( int bad, AryDCB *dcb, int *status ) {
/*

*  Name:
*     ary1Dsbd

*  Purpose:
*     Set the bad pixel flag for a data object.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Dsbd( int bad, AryDCB *dcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine sets the bad pixel flag to a specified value for a
*     DCB.

*  Parameters:
*     bad
*        Bad pixel flag value to be set.
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the DCB.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.
