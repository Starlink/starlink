void ary1Dcrep( int defer, const char *type, int ndim, const hdsdim *ubnd,

*  Name:
*     ary1Dcrep

*  Purpose:
*     Create a primitive array with an entry in the DCB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Dcrep( int defer, const char *type, int ndim, const hdsdim *ubnd,
*                     int temp, HDSLoc **loc, AryDCB **dcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function converts an array placeholder object into a primitive
*     array and creates a new entry in the DCB to refer to it. The
*     placeholder object is passed by an HDS locator, which may be
*     annulled afterwards.

*  Parameters:
*     defer
*        Should the creation of the HDS primitive array be defered until
*        it is mapped? This is useful if the properties of the array
*        (i.e. bounds and type) may be changed before it is mapped in
*        such a way as to reduce the size of the array. If the creation
*        of the HDS array is not deferred, then the final size of the
*        container file may be larger than necessary size HDS does not
*        clean up any unneeded disk space leftby reducing the size of a
*        previously created object. A deferred array is indicated by the
*        fact that it has a null locator for its non-imaginary component.
*     type
*        Data type of the array to be created; an HDS primitive numeric
*        data type string (case insensitive).
*     ndim
*        Number of array dimensions.
*     ubnd
*        Upper bounds of the array (the lower bounds are taken to be 1).
*     temp
*        Whether the array is temporary (this is used to set its
*        disposal mode entry in the DCB).
*     loc
*        Locator to an array placeholder object (an empty scalar data
*        structure of type ARRAY); it should not be a cell or a slice.
*        A new locator is returned, since the original structure will
*        be erased and a new primitive array created in its place.
*     dcb
*        Returned holding a DCB pointer for the new data object.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     - The DCB mutex must be locked.
