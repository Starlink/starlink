void ary1Dobj( AryDCB *dcb, int *status ) {
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ary1Dobj

*  Purpose:
*     Ensure that the HDS primitive arrays holding the real and (if
*     necessary) imaginary values have been created.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Dobj( AryDCB *dcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function ensures that HDS arrays exist to hold the real and (if
*     necessary) imaginary parts of the array data values. This may not
*     be the case if creation of these objects was deferred when calling
*     ary1Dcre or ary1Dcrep.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        The data object (DCB).
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     The DCB mutex must be locked.
