*  Name:
*     aryUnmap

*  Purpose:
*     Unmap an array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryUnmap( Ary *ary, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function unmaps an array which has previously been mapped for
*     READ, UPDATE or WRITE access.

*  Parameters:
*     ary
*        Array identifier.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
*     -  An error will result if the array has not previously been
*     mapped for access.
