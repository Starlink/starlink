void aryLock( Ary *ary, int readonly, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     aryLock

*  Purpose:
*     Lock an array for exclusive use by the current thread.

*  Synopsis:
*     aryLock( Ary *ary, int readonly, int *status );

*  Description:
*     This function locks an ARY array for use by the current thread.
*     An array can be locked for read-only access or read-write access.
*     Multiple threads can lock an array simultaneously for read-only
*     access, but only one thread can lock an array for read-write access
*     at any one time. Use of any ARY function that may modify any aspect
*     of the array - either the data values stored in the array or the
*     meta-data describing the whole array - will fail with an error unless
*     the thread has locked the array for read-write access. Use of an ARY
*     function that cannot modify the array will fail with an error unless
*     the thread has locked the array (in this case the lock can be either
*     for read-only or read-write access).
*
*     If "readonly" is zero (indicating the current thread wants to
*     modify some aspect of the array), this function will report an error
*     if any other thread currently has a lock (read-only or read-write)
*     on the array.
*
*     If "readonly" is non-zero (indicating the current thread wants
*     read-only access to the array), this function will report an error
*     only if another thread currently has a read-write lock on the array.
*
*     The current thread must unlock the array using aryUnlock before it
*     can be locked for use by another thread. All arrays are initially
*     locked by the current thread when they are created or opened. The
*     type of access available to the array ("Read", "Write" or "Update")
*     determines the type of the initial lock. For pre-existing arrays,
*     this is determined by the access mode specified when it is first
*     opened. For new and temporary arrays, the initial lock is always
*     a read-write lock.

*  Parameters:
*     ary
*        Pointer to the array that is to be locked.
*     readonly
*        If non-zero, the array is locked for read-only access. Otherwise
*        it is locked for read-write access.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Notes:
*     - If the version of HDS being used does not support object locking,
*     this function will return without action unless the HDS tuning
*     parameter V4LOCKERROR is set to a non-zero value, in which case an
*     error will be reported.
*     - An error will be reported if the supplied array is currently
*     locked by another thread.
*     - The majority of ARY functions will report an error if the array
*     supplied to the function has not been locked for use by the calling
*     thread. The exceptions are the functions that manage these locks -
*     aryLock, datUnlock and aryLocked.
*     - Attempting to lock an array that is already locked by the
*     current thread will change the type of lock (read-only or
*     read-write) if the lock types differ, but will otherwise have no
*     effect.
