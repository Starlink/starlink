*  Name:
*     ary1Id2Ac

*  Purpose:
*     Convert an identifier into the associated ACB or PCB pointer.

*  Synopsis:
*     AryObject *ary1Id2ac( const void *id_ptr, const int isacb )

*  Description:
*     The routine converts an identifier, previously issued by
*     ary1Expid, into a pointer to the appropriate ACB pr PCB structure.
*     The identifier supplied is fully checked and a NULL pointer is
*     returned if it is not valid.

*  Parameters:
*     id_ptr
*        The identifier, in the form of an Ary or AryPlace pointer.
*     isacb
*        Indicates the type of object expected by the calling function.
*        Non-zero indicates an ACB is expected. Zero indicates a PCB is
*        expected.

*  Returned function value:
*     Pointer to the ACB or PCB structure, or NULL of the identifier supplied
*     was not valid.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine does not perform error checking or reporting.

*     12-DEC-2017 (DSB):
*        Use zero-based slot index when checking against bounds of
