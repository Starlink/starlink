*  Name:
*     aryBad

*  Purpose:
*     Determine if an array may contain bad pixels.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryBad( Ary *ary, int check, int *bad, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a boolean value indicating whether an array
*     may contain bad pixels for which checks must be made when its
*     values are processed. Only if the returned value is zero can
*     such checks be omitted.  If the "check" argument to this function
*     is set non-zero, then it will perform an explicit check (if
*     necessary) to see whether bad pixels are actually present.

*  Parameters:
*     ary
*        Array identifier.
*     check
*        If non-zero, an explicit check is performed to see if bad pixels
*        are actually present.
*     bad
*        Returned holding a flag indicating whether it is necessary to
*        check for bad pixels when processing the array's values.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If "check" is set to zero, then the returned value of "bad" will
*     indicate whether bad pixels might be present and should therefore
*     be checked for during subsequent processing. However, even if "bad"
*     is returned non-zero in such circumstances, it is still possible
*     that there may not actually be any bad pixels present (for
*     instance, in an array section, the region of the base array
*     accessed might happen to avoid all the bad pixels).
*     -  If "check" is set non-zero, then an explicit check will be made,
*     if necessary, to ensure that "bad" is only returned non-zero if bad
*     pixels are actually present.
*     -  If the array is mapped for access through the identifier
*     supplied, then the value of "bad" will refer to the actual mapped
*     values. It may differ from its original (unmapped) value if
*     conversion errors occurred during the mapping process, or if an
*     initialisation option of '/ZERO' was specified for an array which
*     was initially undefined, or if the mapped values have subsequently
*     been modified.
*     -  The "bad" argument will always be returned holding a non-zero value
*     if the array is in an undefined state.
