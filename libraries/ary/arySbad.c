void arySbad( int bad, Ary *ary, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     arySbad

*  Purpose:
*     Set the bad-pixel flag for an array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void arySbad( int bad, Ary *ary, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets the value of the bad-pixel flag for an array
*     A call to this routine with "bad" set non-zero declares that the
*     specified array may contain bad pixel values for which checks
*     must be made by algorithms which subsequently processes its
*     values.  A call with "bad" set to zero declares that there are
*     definitely no bad values present and that subsequent checks for
*     such values may be omitted.

*  Parameters:
*     bad
*        Bad-pixel flag value to be set.
*     ary
*        Array identifier.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the array is mapped for access when this routine is called,
*     then the bad-pixel flag will be associated with the mapped
*     values. This information will only be transferred to the actual
*     data object when the array is unmapped (but only if it was mapped
*     for UPDATE or WRITE access). The value transferred may be
*     modified if conversion errors occur during the unmapping process.
