*  Name:
*     ary1Sbnd

*  Purpose:
*     Set new array bounds for an ACB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Sbnd( int ndim, const hdsdim *lbnd, const hdsdim *ubnd,
*                    AryACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets new bounds for an array identified by its ACB
*     entry. If the array is a section, then its bounds are simply
*     changed and no other ACB entries are affected. However, if the
*     array is a base array, then the actual data object bounds are
*     altered and this change is reflected in all other ACB entries
*     which refer to it. If the array's data values are defined, then
*     any pixels lying within both the old and new bounds will be
*     retained and any new pixels introduced will be assigned the "bad"
*     value.  Pixels excluded by the new bounds are lost, and cannot be
*     regained by further changes to the array bounds (in the case of
*     changes to a base array, they are lost permanently and can never
*     be recovered).  If bad pixels are introduced (i.e. if the new
*     bounds extend outside the old bounds), then the array's bad pixel
*     flag will be updated to reflect this.

*  Parameters:
*     ndim
*        New number of dimensions for the array.
*     lbnd
*        Array of new lower bounds for the array.
*     ubnd
*        Array of new upper bounds for the array.
*     acb
*        Index to the array's ACB entry.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  The bounds of an array section cannot be changed while mapped
*     access to it is in effect. In the case of a base array, no access
*     to any part of it can be in effect.

*  Side Effects:
*     -  Any data lost as a result of changing the bounds of a base
*     array will cease to be available to any array which refers to that
*     base array.
*     -  If bad pixels are introduced into a base array as a result of
*     calling this routine, then the bad pixel flag will be set and
*     this may be apparent through enquiries made about other arrays
*     which refer to the same base array.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     -  This routine takes a rather pessimistic view of bad pixels; it
*     considers that if bad pixels are introduced by changing the array
*     bounds then they may be positioned anywhere within the new
*     bounds.
