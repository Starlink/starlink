void ary1Sbd( int bad, AryACB *acb, int *status ) {
/*

*  Name:
*     ary1Sbd

*  Purpose:
*     Set the bad pixel flag for an array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Sbd( int bad, AryACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine sets a bad pixel flag value for a given ACB. A call
*     to this routine constitutes a declaration about the presence
*     (or otherwise) of "bad" values in an array and, hence, their
*     presence (or otherwise) in the data region with which the array
*     is associated via its mapping transfer region. The routine
*     starts by modifying the specified ACB bad pixel flag entry. Then,
*     if appropriate, it updates the actual data object bad pixel flag.
*     Finally, it checks other ACB entries which refer to the same data
*     object and modifies their bad pixel flags if this proves
*     necessary as a result of overlapping mapping transfer regions.

*  Parameters:
*     bad
*        Bad pixel flag value to be set.
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB for the array.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB and ACB mutexes must be locked.
