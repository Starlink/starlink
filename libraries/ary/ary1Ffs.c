void *ary1Ffs( const AryBlockType type, int *status ) {
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ary1Ffs

*  Purpose:
*     Allocate an ARY "block" structure of any type.

*  Synopsis:
*     void *ary1Ffs( const AryBlockType type, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine finds a free slot in one of the arrays holding pointers
*     to "block" structures within by the ARY_ system. The pointer stored
*     in the free slot is returned and the structure is marked as used.
*     A new structure is created and the array of pointers is extended
*     if no further free slots exist.
*
*     An array of pointers is used, with each actual structure being
*     allocated separately, so that extending the array using realloc
*     does not change the pointers to the structures. If an array of
*     structures had been used, extending it using realloc would have
*     changed the address of each structure.

*  Parameters:
*     type
*        The type of "block" structure to be allocated. The constants
*        ARY__ACBTYPE, ARY__DCBTYPE, ARY__MCBTYPE and ARY__PCBTYPE are
*        available to identify these.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Returned function value:
*     A pointer to the object held in the allocated slot of the array.
*     The returned pointer should be cast to the required type (AryDCB,
*     AryACB, etc).

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The relevant "block" mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  The returned pointer should be released using ary1Rls when it is
*     no longer needed.
*     -  If STATUS is set on entry, then a NULL value will be returned,
*     although no further processing will occur.
*     -  A NULL value will also be returned if the routine should fail
*     for any reason.
