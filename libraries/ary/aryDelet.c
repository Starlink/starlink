*  Name:
*     aryDelet

*  Purpose:
*     Delete an array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryDelet( Ary **ary, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function deletes the specified array. If this is a base array,
*     then the associated data object is erased and all array
*     identifiers which refer to it (or to sections derived from it)
*     become invalid. If the array is mapped for access, then it is
*     first unmapped.  If an array section is specified, then this
*     function is equivalent to calling aryAnnul.

*  Parameters:
*     ary
*        Identifier for the array to be deleted. A value of NULL
*        is returned.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
*     -  A value of NULL is always returned for the "ary" argument,
*     even if the function should fail.
