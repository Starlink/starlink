void aryForm( Ary *ary, char form[ARY__SZFRM+1], int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     aryForm

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain the storage form of an array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryForm( Ary *ary, char form[ARY__SZFRM+1], int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the storage form of an array as an upper-case
*     character string (e.g. 'SIMPLE').

*  Parameters:
*     ary
*        Array identifier.
*     form
*        Returned holding the storage form of the array.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The symbolic constant ARY__SZFRM should be used for declaring the
*     length of a character variable to hold the storage form of an
*     array. This constant is defined in the header file ary.h.
*     -  At present, the ARY_ routines only support "primitive", "scaled",
*     "simple" and "delta" arrays, so only the values 'PRIMITIVE', 'SCALED'
*     'DELTA' and 'SIMPLE' can be returned.
