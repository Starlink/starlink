void ary1Imp( HDSLoc *loc, AryACB **acb, int *status ) {
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ary1Imp

*  Purpose:
*     Import an array structure into the ACB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Imp( HDSLoc *loc, AryACB **acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine imports an array data structure, identified by its
*     HDS locator, returning a pointer to the base array ACB structure
*     allocated for it. This routine detects if the same data object
*     has previously been imported and takes account of this possibility.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        HDS locator to the data object to be imported.
*     acb
*        Address of a variable in which to return the pointer to the
*        resulting base array ACB structure.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If STATUS is set on entry, then NULL will be returned for the
*     ACB pointer, although no further processing will occur.
*     -  A value of NULL will also be returned if the routine fails
*     for any reason.

*  History:
*     03-JUL-2017 (DSB):
*        Original version, based on equivalent Fortran routine by RFWS.
*     20-APR-2018 (DSB):
*        The original C version of this function reported an error if the
*        requested array was already mapped with a different access mode.
*        This differed from the F77 version, which promoted any existing
*        read-only DCB entries to "UPDATE" access in such cases. This
*        difference was introduced in an attempt to reduce the chance of
*        errors occurring in mult-threaded applications. However, there
*        are cases where the original behaviour is required (e.g.
*        kappa:wcsalign needs it when attmepting to modify the input NDFs
*        - when parameter INSITU is set TRUE). Experience from smurf
*        suggests that it should be the responsibility of the application
*        code to avoid simultaneous reading and writing of the same parts
*        of an array. And the original C behaviour was flawed anyway,
*        because it did not preclude the simulataneous mapping of an
*        array for write access by two threads, which is just as likely to
*        produce threading issues as simultaneous reading and writing. So
*        this change re-instates the F77 behaviour.
