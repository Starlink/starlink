void ary1Del( AryACB **acb, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     ary1Del

*  Purpose:
*     Perform a deletion operation on an ACB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Del( AryACB **acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function performs a deletion operation on an entry in the ACB.
*     If the specified ACB entry describes a base array, then it and
*     all other ACB entries which refer to the same data object are
*     annulled, and the data object is erased.  If the ACB entry does
*     not describe a base array, then that ACB entry (alone) is
*     annulled, and the data object is not erased.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        The ACB on which the deletion operation is to be performed.
*        A value of NULL is returned.
*     status
*        The global status.

* Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine attempts to execute even if STATUS is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.

*  Side Effects:
*     -   If a data object is erased, then all array identifiers which
*     refer to it become invalid.
