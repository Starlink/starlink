void ary1Ump( AryACB *acb, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     ary1Ump

*  Purpose:
*     Unmap an array specified by its ACB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Ump( AryACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine performs an unmapping operation on an ACB through
*     which an array has previously been mapped for access.  An
*     error will be reported if the array has not been mapped through
*     the specified ACB.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB on which the unmapping operation is to
*        be performed.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  The DCB and ACB mutexes must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     -  The routine attempts to execute even if 'status' is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
*     -  The DCB mutex should be locked.
