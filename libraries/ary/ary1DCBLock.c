int ary1DCBLock( AryDCB *dcb, int oper, int rdonly, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ary1DCBLock

*  Purpose:
*     Manage the lock on a DCB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     int ary1DCBLock( AryDCB *dcb, int oper, int rdonly, int *status );

*  Description:
*     This function locks or unlocks the supplied DCB for read-only or
*     read-write access. The DCB is always in one of the following
*     three mutually exclusive states:
*
*     - Unlocked
*     - Locked for read-write access by one and only one thread.
*     - Locked for read-only access by one or more threads.
*
*     When locked for read-write access, the locking thread has exclusive
*     read-write access to the HDS object described by the supplied DCB.
*     When locked for read-only access, the locking thread shares read-only
*     access with zero or more other threads.

*  Arguments:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the DCB structure.
*     oper = int (Given)
*        Operation to be performed:
*
*        1 - Return information about the current locks on the supplied DCB.
*
*           -1: Locking unsupported (e.g HDS is V4 or earlier).
*            0: unlocked;
*            1: locked for writing by the current thread;
*            2: locked for writing by another thread;
*            3: locked for reading by the current thread (other threads
*               may also have a read lock on the DCB);
*            4: locked for reading by one or more other threads (the
*               current thread does not have a read lock on the DCB);
*
*        2 - Lock the DCB for read-write or read-only use by the current
*            thread. Reports an error if the requested lock conflicts with an
*            existing lock. A value of +1 is always returned.
*
*        3 - Unlock the DCB. If the current thread has a lock - either
*            read-write or read-only - on the DCB, it is removed.
*            Otherwise an error is reported. A value of +1 is always
*            returned.
*
*     rdonly = int (Given)
*        Only used if "oper" is 2. It indicates if the new lock is for
*        read-only or read-write access.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned function value:
*     The values returned for each operation are included in the
*     description of the "oper" argument above.

* Prior Requirements:
*     - The DCB mutex must be locked.

*  Notes:
*     - If the version of HDS being used does not support object locking,
*     this function will return without action for "oper" values 2 or 3
*     unless the HDS tuning parameter V4LOCKERROR is set to a non-zero
*     value, in which case an error will be reported.
*     - If a thread gets a read-write lock on the DCB, and
*     subsequently attempts to get a read-only lock, the existing
*     read-write lock will be demoted to a read-only lock.
*     - If a thread gets a read-only lock on the DCB, and
*     subsequently attempts to get a read-write lock, the existing
*     read-only lock will be promoted to a read-write lock only if
*     there are no other locks on the DCB.
*     - A value of zero is returned if an error has already ocurred, or
*     if this function fails for any reason.
