*  Notes:
*     - DATE is the instant for which the prediction is required.  It is
*       in the TT timescale (formerly Ephemeris Time, ET) and is a
*       Modified Julian Date (JD-2400000.5).
*     - The longitude and latitude allow correction for geocentric
*       parallax.  This is usually a small effect, but can become
*       important for near-Earth asteroids.  Geocentric positions can be
*       generated by appropriate use of routines palEpv (or palEvp) and
*       palUe2pv.
*     - The elements are with respect to the J2000 ecliptic and equinox.
*     - A choice of three different element-set options is available:
*
*       Option JFORM = 1, suitable for the major planets:
*
*         EPOCH  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
*         ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
*         ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
*         PERIH  = longitude of perihelion, curly pi (radians)
*         AORQ   = mean distance, a (AU)
*         E      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to <1)
*         AORL   = mean longitude L (radians)
*         DM     = daily motion (radians)
*
*       Option JFORM = 2, suitable for minor planets:
*
*         EPOCH  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
*         ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
*         ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
*         PERIH  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
*         AORQ   = mean distance, a (AU)
*         E      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to <1)
*         AORL   = mean anomaly M (radians)
*
*       Option JFORM = 3, suitable for comets:
*
*         EPOCH  = epoch of elements and perihelion (TT MJD)
*         ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
*         ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
*         PERIH  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
*         AORQ   = perihelion distance, q (AU)
*         E      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to 10)
*
*       Unused arguments (DM for JFORM=2, AORL and DM for JFORM=3) are not
*       accessed.
*     - Each of the three element sets defines an unperturbed heliocentric
*       orbit.  For a given epoch of observation, the position of the body
*       in its orbit can be predicted from these elements, which are
*       called "osculating elements", using standard two-body analytical
*       solutions.  However, due to planetary perturbations, a given set
*       of osculating elements remains usable for only as long as the
*       unperturbed orbit that it describes is an adequate approximation
*       to reality.  Attached to such a set of elements is a date called
*       the "osculating epoch", at which the elements are, momentarily,
*       a perfect representation of the instantaneous position and
*       velocity of the body.
*
*       Therefore, for any given problem there are up to three different
*       epochs in play, and it is vital to distinguish clearly between
*       them:
*
*       . The epoch of observation:  the moment in time for which the
*         position of the body is to be predicted.
*
*       . The epoch defining the position of the body:  the moment in time
*         at which, in the absence of purturbations, the specified
*         position (mean longitude, mean anomaly, or perihelion) is
*         reached.
*
*       . The osculating epoch:  the moment in time at which the given
*         elements are correct.
*
*       For the major-planet and minor-planet cases it is usual to make
*       the epoch that defines the position of the body the same as the
*       epoch of osculation.  Thus, only two different epochs are
*       involved:  the epoch of the elements and the epoch of observation.
*
*       For comets, the epoch of perihelion fixes the position in the
*       orbit and in general a different epoch of osculation will be
*       chosen.  Thus, all three types of epoch are involved.
*
*       For the present routine:
*
*       . The epoch of observation is the argument DATE.
*
*       . The epoch defining the position of the body is the argument
*         EPOCH.
*
*       . The osculating epoch is not used and is assumed to be close
*         enough to the epoch of observation to deliver adequate accuracy.
*         If not, a preliminary call to sla_PERTEL may be used to update
*         the element-set (and its associated osculating epoch) by
*         applying planetary perturbations.
*     - Two important sources for orbital elements are Horizons, operated
*       by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, and the Minor Planet
*       Center, operated by the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard.
*
*       The JPL Horizons elements (heliocentric, J2000 ecliptic and
*       equinox) correspond to SLALIB arguments as follows.
