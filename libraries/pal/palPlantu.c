*  Notes:
*     - DATE is the instant for which the prediction is required.  It is
*       in the TT timescale (formerly Ephemeris Time, ET) and is a
*       Modified Julian Date (JD-2400000.5).
*     - The longitude and latitude allow correction for geocentric
*       parallax.  This is usually a small effect, but can become
*       important for near-Earth asteroids.  Geocentric positions can be
*       generated by appropriate use of routines palEpv (or palEvp) and
*       palUe2pv.
*     - The "universal" elements are those which define the orbit for the
*       purposes of the method of universal variables (see reference 2).
*       They consist of the combined mass of the two bodies, an epoch,
*       and the position and velocity vectors (arbitrary reference frame)
*       at that epoch.  The parameter set used here includes also various
*       quantities that can, in fact, be derived from the other
*       information.  This approach is taken to avoiding unnecessary
*       computation and loss of accuracy.  The supplementary quantities
*       are (i) alpha, which is proportional to the total energy of the
*       orbit, (ii) the heliocentric distance at epoch, (iii) the
*       outwards component of the velocity at the given epoch, (iv) an
*       estimate of psi, the "universal eccentric anomaly" at a given
*       date and (v) that date.
*     - The universal elements are with respect to the J2000 equator and
*       equinox.
