      SUBROUTINE PAR_GETV<T>( PARAM, MAXVAL, VALUES, ACTVAL, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     PAR_GETVx

*  Purpose:
*     Obtains a vector of values from a parameter regardless of the
*     its shape.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PAR_GETVx( PARAM, MAXVAL, VALUES, ACTVAL, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine obtains an array of values from a parameter
*     as if the parameter were vectorized (i.e. regardless of its
*     dimensionality).  If necessary, the values are converted to the
*     required type.

*  Arguments:
*     PARAM = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The parameter name.
*     MAXVAL = INTEGER (Given)
*        The maximum number of values that can be held in the values
*        array.
*     VALUES( MAXVAL ) = ? (Returned)
*        Array to receive the values associated with the object.
*     ACTVAL = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The actual number of values obtained.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for each of the data types character,
*     double precision, integer, logical, and real: replace "x" in the
*     routine name by C, D, I, K, L, or R respectively as appropriate.  The
*     VALUES argument must have the corresponding data type.
*     -  Note that this routine will accept a scalar value, returning
*     a single-element vector.

*  Algorithm:
*     Call the underlying parameter-system primitives.
