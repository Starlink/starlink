  <description>NBS Noticeboard System</description>
  <abstract><p> The noticeboard system routines provide a fast means
  for processes to share data in global memory. A given process may
  own as many noticeboards as it wishes and may access noticeboards
  owned by other processes.  Normally the only process that writes to
  a noticeboard is its owner but other processes that know what they
  are doing can subvert this rule either by calling a special routine
  or else by accessing noticeboard data by using a pointer.
