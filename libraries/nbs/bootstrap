# If you _need_ to change this file, delete or replace `original' above
# or else starconf may overwrite it with an updated version

# bootstrap.installed.  Generated from bootstrap.installed.in by configure.

# Bootstrap a checked-out component of the Starlink software tree.
# Run this script in a freshly checked-out directory to bring the
# system to the point where you can just type ./configure;make
#
# Usage:
#     ./bootstrap
#
# Important environment variables:
#
#     STARCONF_BUILDSUPPORT: this bootstrap script executes the
#     configuration script $STARCONF_BUILDSUPPORT/bin/starconf, and
#     objects if it can't find it.  This script adds required files,
#     and establishes installation directories.
#
# The configuration script here works with automake versions 1.6.3 and
# 1.7.5, and autoconf 2.57, and probably not much that's significantly
# older than those.

# Echo a command then run it, terminating the script if the command fails
