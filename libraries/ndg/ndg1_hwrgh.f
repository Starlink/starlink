      SUBROUTINE NDG1_HWRGH( INDF, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDG1_HWRGH

*  Purpose:
*     Write GRP history to an NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDG1_HWRGH( INDF, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     This routine appends a description of each currently registered GRP
*     group to the current History record in the supplied NDF. It then
*     unregisters each group. See NDF_ENDGH.

*  Arguments:
*     INDF = INTEGER (Given)
*        The NDF identifier.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - The NDG globals mutex should be locked with NDG1_GLOCK before
*     calling this routine.

*  History:
*     20-OCT-2009 (DSB):
*        Original version (taken from NDG_ENDGH).
*     19-AUG-2010 (DSB):
*        Remove each group from the KeyMap after it has been written out.
*     21-AUG-2010 (DSB):
*        Now that entries are removed from the KeyMap, we need to access
*        keymap entry number 1 every time.
*     21-JUL-2011 (DSB):
*        There was a problem with the scheme of removing each group from
*        the KeyMap at the end of this routine - the group was only
*        written out to the first output NDF created by an NDF, and
*        sometimes the main NDF is not the first NDF to be created. So, I've
*        reverted to the original scheme were the groups are not deleted
*        by this routine, so they are still around to be written out to
*        subsequent NDFs. But this allows the possibility of writing the
*        same group out twice to the same NDF. To avoid this, the
*        DHKMP_COM2 KeyMap (which holds the paths of the NDFs to which
*        default history has been written) is now used to associate a
*        list of parameter names with each NDF. This list contains the
*        names of all the parameters which have already been written out
*        to the NDF and should not be written out again.
