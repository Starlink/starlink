#  Name:
#     ndg_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against the ADAM version
#     of the NDG library.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building ADAM applications
#     that use the NDG library in order to generate the correct arguments
#     for the compiler (or ld) command.  The arguments generated are written
#     to the standard output.

#  Invocation:
#     The script may be invoked as part of a command such as:
#
#        alink program.f -L/star/lib `ndg_link_adam`
