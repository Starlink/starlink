*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global constants include file.

*  Description:
*     This file contains definitions of global constants which are used

*  Global Constants:


*  Maximum number of axes to consider. This should be equal to
*  NDF__MXDIM.
      INTEGER ATL__MXDIM
      PARAMETER ( ATL__MXDIM = 7 )

*  An string value indicating an undefined value (sort of like a string
*  equivalent of VAL__BADR, etc)
      CHARACTER ATL__BADC*9
      PARAMETER ( ATL__BADC = 'ATL__BADC' )

*  The length of the above bad string.
      INTEGER ATL__SZBADC
      PARAMETER ( ATL__SZBADC = 9 )
