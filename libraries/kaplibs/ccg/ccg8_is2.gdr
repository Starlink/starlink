      SUBROUTINE CCG8_IS2<T>( EL, ORDDAT, ANCDAT, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     CCG8_IS2x

*  Purpose:
*     Sorts a list of data into increasing order, and applies the
*     corresponding shuffle to an ancillary list

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL CCG8_IS2x( EL, ORDDAT, ANCDAT, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine uses an insert-sort method.  This has proven itself
*     the quickest for sorting small sets of data lots of times, as in
*     image stacking using ordered statistics.  The method looks at the
*     second value, compares this with the first if swaps if necessary,
*     then it looks at the third, looks at the previous values swaps
*     with the lowest (or not at all) and so on until all values have
*     been passed.  It is fast (for the case above) simply because of
*     the very few lines of operation.  The sort is extended to the
*     ancillary data ANCDAT, this maintains its correspondence with the
*     ORDDAT dataset on exit.

*  Arguments:
*     EL = INTEGER*8 (Given)
*        The number of entries in ORDDAT.
*     ORDDAT( EL ) = ? (Given and Returned)
*        The data to order. On output it contains the data in increasing
*        order.
*     ANCDAT( EL ) = INTEGER*8 (Given and Returned)
*        A list of data associated with ORDDAT which needs to retain its
*        correspondence with the items in ORDDAT (probably pointers).
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for real and double-precision: replace "x"
*     in the routine name by D or R as appropriate.  The ORDDAT
*     argument supplied to the routine must have the data type
*     specified.

*  History:
*     5-APR-1991 (PDRAPER):
*        Original version.
*     30-MAY-1991 (PDRAPER):
*        Added ANCDAT stuff, note ANCDAT is integer.
*     2009 July 2 (MJC):
*         Converted to generic and renamed from CCG1_IS2R.  Moved EL
*         (after renaming from NENT) to the normal order in the API.
