#  Name:
#     msp_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against adam MSP.

#  Language:
#     {routine_language}

#  Type Of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a compiler command line,
#     such as:
#
#        alink program.f -L/star/lib `msp_link_adam`
#
#     although the ADAM "alink" command will normally link against MSP
#     anyway.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building ADAM applications
#     which use MSP in order to generate the correct arguments for the 
#     compiler (or ld) command. The arguments generated are written to 
#     the standard output.
