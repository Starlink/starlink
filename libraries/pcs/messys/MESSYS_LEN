*  Global Constants:
      INTEGER MSG_LEN   !  length of message in bytes (from DDPATH)
      PARAMETER ( MSG_LEN = 500 )   !  must be divisible by 4
*       !!! N.B. if this is changed MESDEFNS must be changed also
      INTEGER MSG_FIX_LEN   !  length of non-value part of non-path part
      PARAMETER ( MSG_FIX_LEN = 56 )
      INTEGER MSG_VAL_LEN   !  length of value part of message
      PARAMETER ( MSG_VAL_LEN = MSG_LEN - MSG_FIX_LEN )
      INTEGER MSG_NAME_LEN
      PARAMETER ( MSG_NAME_LEN = 32 )
