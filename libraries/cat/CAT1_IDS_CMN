*  Name:
*     CAT1_IDS_CMN
*  Purpose:
*     Internal common block holdling the list of identifiers.
*  Language:
*     FORTRAN 77.
*  Type of Module:
*     INCLUDE FILE.
*  Description:
*     Internal common block holdling the list of identifiers.
*
*     For each identifier the following information is recorded:
*
*      - the value of the identifier,
*      - its type (catalogue, column, parameter etc.),
*      - the first element in the attributes common blocks to store
*        its attributes,
*      - the identifier which is the parent of the current identifier.
*      - the corresponding array element in the catalogue arrays (this
*        quantity is only used for catalogue identifiers, for other
*        identifiers it is set to zero).

*     6/3/95  (ACD): Modified to reflect the changed names for the
*        constants defining the array sizes.
*     7/3/95  (ACD): Added array IDCEL__CAT1.
*     11/4/95 (ACD): Changed the name given in the 'Name:' section of
