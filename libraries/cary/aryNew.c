*  Name:
*     aryNew

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new simple array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryNew( const char *ftype, int ndim, const hdsdim *lbnd, const hdsdim *ubnd,
*                  AryPlace **place, Ary **ary, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new simple array and returns an identifier
*     for it. The array may subsequently be manipulated with other Ary
*     functions.

*  Parameters:
*     ftype
*        Full data type of the array.
*     ndim
*        Number of array dimensions.
*     lbnd
*        Lower pixel-index bounds of the array.
*     ubnd
*        Upper pixel-index bounds of the array.
*     place
*        On exntry, holds an array placeholder (e.g. generated by the
*        aryPlace function) which indicates the position in the data
*        system where the new array will reside. The placeholder is
*        annulled by this function, and a value of NULL will be returned
*        on exit.
*     ary
*        Returned holding an identifier for the new array.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If this routine is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NULL will be returned for the "ary" argument, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be
*     returned if the routine should fail for any reason. In either
*     event, the placeholder will still be annulled.
