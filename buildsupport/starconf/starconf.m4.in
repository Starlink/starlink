# STAR_DEFAULTS(options='')
# -------------------------
# Defaults for Starlink configure.ac files.  The optional OPTIONS
# argument holds a space-separated list of option keywords, of which
# the only ones at present are `per-package-dirs', which causes
# applications and help to be installed in a package-specific
# directory, and 'docs-only', which indicates that the component contains
# only documentation.
#
# Certain features of this macro are documented in SSN/78, in particular
#   - Sets STARLINK
#   - Sets AM_FCFLAGS, AM_FFLAGS, AM_CFLAGS, AM_LDFLAGS to appropriate values
#   - Sets PACKAGE_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,RELEASE,INTEGER}
# The behaviour of these should not be changed without changing the
# documentation, or without due consideration of the packages which use
# the earlier behaviour.  Everything else is, in principle, private
# (not that that's going to stop folk).

# However, we install software in @STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX@ by

# STAR_CNF_COMPATIBLE_SYMBOLS
# ---------------------------
#
# Work out what is required to have the Fortran compiler produce
# library symbols which are compatible with those expected by the CNF
# package.  If you are building a library in which C code refers to
# Fortran libraries, then you should call this macro, which possibly
# adjusts the AM_FCFLAGS variable.  That is, if you include cnf.h, you
# should have this macro in the configure.ac.
#
# This macro deals with the following issue.  The cnf.h header
# includes a macro F77_EXTERNAL_NAME which mangles a C name into the
# corresponding name the Fortran compiler would generate; this
# generally means no more than appending a single underscore.  As the
# autoconf documentation for AC_FC_WRAPPERS points out, this is less
# general than it could be, as some Fortrans fold symbols to
# uppercase, and some (in particular g77) add two underscores to
# symbols which already contain one (thus mangling 'ab' to 'ab_', but
# 'a_b' to 'a_b__').  This behaviour would break the F77_EXTERNAL_NAME
# macro, which is used throughout the Starlink code in both cases,
# unless we compiled all the Starlink Fortran libraries in a mode which
# suppressed this second underscore.  Working out how to do that --
# if it's necessary at all -- is what this macro does.
#
# The more restricted interface of F77_EXTERNAL_NAME is, by the way,
# the reason why we cannot simply copy the FC_FUNC definition to the
# cnf.h file as F77_EXTERNAL_NAME: the latter macro is used for
# symbols both with and without an underscore.
#
# If we ever have to migrate the Starlink software to a Fortran which
# does more complicated name mangling, we'll almost certainly have to
# perform more serious surgery on cnf.h, using the results of
# AC_FC_WRAPPERS, along with similar surgery on the code which invokes
# it.
#
# This macro is designed to work with CNF, however it does _not_
# require the cnf.h headers to be installed, because it should remain
# callable at configuration time before _anything_ has been installed.
# In the test code below, we therefore emulate the definition of
# F77_EXTERNAL_NAME in cnf.h, which appends a single underscore.
# to the end of C symbols.

# STAR_CNF_F2C_COMPATIBLE
# -----------------------
#
# Work out if the compiler is using 'f2c' compatible calling conventions.
#
# The `f2c' calling conventions, used by GNU Fortran compilers, require
# functions that return type REAL to actually return the C type 'double'
# (there is also special handling of COMPLEX returns, but that's not supported
# by CNF). When operating in 'non-f2c' mode such functions return the expected
# C type 'float'.
#
# The effect of this macro is subsitute the variable REAL_FUNCTION_TYPE
# to either float or double as required.
#
# This function is not infallable and will usually return float for GNU
# compilers, as the calling convention seems to not matter on 32-bit platforms
# for the test in use. A stronger test would be to attempt calling a intrinsic
# function, which is supposed to fail. Non-GNU compilers should always
# return float. However, this test is used as it is all that is required.

#  In fact this macro is only currently used for the gfortran and Solaris f95

#  point equivalents). The Solaris f95 compiler doesn't allow assignments to
#  LOGICAL parameters, so we need to use the -f77 flag.

# passed from Fortran to C. See the "TRAIL" descriptions in SUN/209.
#
# For most compilers the maximum length of a string is limited to a 32bit
# unsigned int, but for others, this can be a 64bit unsigned long. Currently
# the only compilers with 64bit strings are 64bit Intel fortran and
# Solaris studio12 with -m64.
#
# The test is only performed for 64bit compilers, all others are assumed
# to use 32bit lengths. Various attempts to trap this issue permanently
# using a test program have failed (especially for the Intel compiler), so the
# actual test is to check for a known 64 bit compiler first and then try a
# program that has had some success. Note no GNU compilers seem to have this
# problem so they are never tested.
#
# The side-effect of this macro is to substitute TRAIL_TYPE with
# the derived value and define TRAIL_TYPE. See "f77.h" in CNF.

# STAR_CHECK_PROGS(progs-to-check-for, [component=''])
# --------------------------------------------------
#
# For each of the programs in PROGS-TO-CHECK-FOR, define a variable
# whose name is the upcased version of the program name, and whose
# value is the full path to that program, or the expected installation
# location of that program if no absolute path can be found.  Because
# of this default behaviour, this macro should _only_ be used for
# locating Starlink programs such as messgen or alink, and not as a
# general replacement for AC_CHECK_PROG.  Any characters in the
# program outside of the set of alphanumerics and underscores are
# normalised to underscores.
#
# The optional second argument gives the name of the component containing
# the program in question.  Some packages install their binaries in
# package-specific directories, and this argument allows this macro to
# look there as well.
#
# For example:
#     STAR_CHECK_PROGS(messgen)
# would define the variable MESSGEN to have the full path to the
# messgen application, and
#     STAR_CHECK_PROGS(prolat, sst)
# would define the variable PROLAT to have the path to the prolat
# application within the sst component.
#
# Calls AC_SUBST and AC_ARG_VAR on the generated variable name.  This
# macro does _not_ automatically declare a configure dependency on any
# component specified in the second argument.  These dependencies should
# be kept to an absolute minimum, and therefore any such dependencies
# must be declared obviously and explicitly, with rationale.
#
# The behaviour described below, for the result when the required program
# is not found, is not final, and may change.  The documentation below is
# contradictory, and should be regarded merely as a rather confused
# discussion of the issues.  The current behaviour is that when the progam
# is not found, the variable is defined to be the program's name without
# any path at all.
#
# This is the analogue of AC_CHECK_PROG, except that: (1) the variable
# name defaults to the program name, (2) the variable value if the
# program is not found is the path to the anticipated installation
# location of the program, so that the macro does not fail in this
# case.  This is useful for locating Starlink programs, as it means we
# can use this macro to produce absolute paths to programs, even
# before they have been installed (in this case we are presumably
# doing a top-level configure of the Starlink tree, and the Makefile
# will ensure that the required files are installed before the current
# package actually uses it.  NB: (2) is not true at present.
#
# The current value of the PATH variable is augmented by the location
# of the binary installation directory, using the current default
# value of the prefix (not ideal, since this may in principle change
# when the component being configured is installed, but it's the best
# we can do at configure time); and by the $STARLINK/bin directory.
#
# The default, if the program isn't in the augmented path, is the path
# to the starconf-finder program if that's available, and the bare
# program-name otherwise.  Is this the best default?  Would just
# program-name be better?  The program may not be in the augmented
# path for two reasons: (1) we are doing the global configuration done
# during bootstrapping, and noting has been installed yet; or (2) the
# program is one of those installed in a subdirectory of the
# `bindir'.  In case (2), there's not a lot we can do, short of
# grubbing round manifest files at some point, but the
# starconf-finder, which is the eventual default, knows about this
# case, and could take care of it.
#
# No, I've changed my mind again.  If the program isn't found, then
# simply have the AC_PATH_PROG default to bare ProgramName.  This is
# probably adequate, and if so probably more robust than relying on
# more and more layers of indirection.  We probably will need to
# revisit this.  Again.

# STAR_DECLARE_DEPENDENCIES(type, deplist, option='')
# ---------------------------------------------------
#
# Declare dependencies of this component.  The TYPE is one of
# `sourceset', `build', `link', `use', `test' or `configure', and the
# DEPLIST is a space separated list of component names, which this
# component depends on in the given way.
#
# -- Sourceset dependencies are those components which must be
# installed in order to build the complete set of sources, either for
# building or for distribution.  This includes documentation, so it
# would include star2html as well as messgen.
#
# -- Build dependencies are those which are required in order to build
# this component.  This typically means include files, but if part of
# the component is an executable file (such as compifl within the
# parsecon component), then that's a build dependence also (but see
# the discussion of `option', below).  You may not have two components
# which have a build dependency on each other, since that would mean
# that each would have to be built before the other, which is
# impossible.
#
# -- Link dependencies are those required to link against the
# libraries in a component.  That means all the libraries that this
# component's libraries use.  These are not necessarily build
# dependencies, since if you are building a library, any called
# libraries don't have to be present in order to build this library;
# you can have two components which have mutual link dependencies.  If
# you are building an application, however, then all its link
# dependencies will actually be build dependencies and should be
# declared as such.  In other words, the distinction between build and
# link dependencies is important only for library components.
#
# -- Use dependencies are those which are required in order for the
# component to be used by something else, after it has been built and
# installed.  For example a library which called another application
# as part of its functionality would have only a use dependency on the
# component which contained that application.  If no use dependencies
# are declared, we take the use dependencies to be the same as the
# link dependencies.
#
# -- Test dependencies are those which are required in order to run
# any regression tests which come with the component.  It's generally
# a good idea to avoid making this a larger set than the use
# dependencies, but sometimes this is unavoidable.  If no test
# dependencies are declared, we take the test dependencies to be the
# same as the use dependencies.
#
# -- Configure dependencies are those which must be satisfied before
# this component can be successfully configured.  In this case, we
# also check that the corresponding manifest files have been installed
# in current_MANIFESTS, and if not exit with a message, and the suggestion
# that the user runs 'make configure-deps'.
#
# The point of this is that different dependencies are required at
# different times.  The set of dependencies in the master makefile is
# composed of all the `sourceset' and `build' dependencies, but not
# `link' or `use' dependencies, and since the core Starlink libraries
# are closely interdependent, the set of `build' dependencies needs to
# be kept as small as possible in order to avoid circularities (that
# is, A depending on B, which depends, possibly indirectly, on A).
#
# All these relationships are transitive: if A has a build dependency
# on B, and B has one on C, then A has a build dependency on C.  You
# can augment this by using the final `option' argument: if, in
# component A's declaration element you say
# STAR_DECLARE_DEPENDENCIES(build, B, link), then you declare that A
# has a build-time dependency on B, but that (presumably because you
# are building an application within a component which is mostly
# libraries) you need to link against B, so component A has a
# dependency on all of B's _link_ dependencies, not just its build
# dependencies.  This is (I believe) the only case where this `option'
# attribute is useful, though it is legal for each of the dependency types.
#
# You need only declare direct dependencies.  If package A depends on
# package B, which depends in turn on package C, then package A need
# not declare a dependency on C.
#
# The macro may be called more than once.  The results of this macro
# are expressed in the file component.xml in the component directory.

# STAR_PLATFORM_SOURCES(target-file-list, platform-list)

# TARGET-FILE-LIST, by selecting the appropriate element of the
# PLATFORM-LIST based on the value of [AC_CANONICAL_BUILD].  Both
# lists are space-separated lists.
#
# For each of the platforms, <p>, in platform-list, there should be a
# file `<target-file><p>'.  There should always be a file
# `<target-file>default', and if none of the platform-list strings
# matches, this is the file which is used.  If the `default' file is
# listed in the `platform-list', then it is matched in the normal run
# of things; if it is not listed, it still matches, but a warning is
# issued.
#
# If you wish no match _not_ to be an error -- perhaps because there
# is a platform-dependent file which is redundant on unlisted platforms
# -- then end the platform-list with `NONE'.  In this case, if no file
# matches, then no link is made, with no error or warning.
#
# This macro uses the results of ./config.guess to determine the
# current platform.  That returns a triple consisting of
# cpu-vendor-os, such as `i686-pc-linux-gnu' (OS=linux-gnu),
# `sparc-sun-solaris2.9', or `alphaev6-dec-osf5.1'
#
# The extensions <p> in platform-list should all have the form
# `cpu_vendor[_os]', where each of the components `cpu', `vendor' and
# `os' may be blank.  If not blank, they are matched as a prefix of
# the corresponding part of the config.guess value.  Thus
# `_sun_solaris' would match `sparc-sun-solaris2.9' but not
# `sparc-sun-sunos', and `_sun' would match both.  For a <target-file>
# file foo.c, this would result in `ln -s foo.c_sun foo.c'

# STAR_INITIALISE_FORTRAN_RTL
# ---------------------------
#
# Define a macro which can be used in a C main program to initialise the
# Fortran RTL, including, for example, doing whatever work is required so that
# the Fortran getarg() function works.  This defines the macro
# STAR_INITIALISE_FORTRAN(argc,argv).  The implementation necessarily uses
# functions which are specific to the Fortran implementation, and the body of
# this macro is basically a switch to determine the compiler and thus the
# appropriate compiler-specific magic.  If no implementation is available,
# then the macro should expand to nothing.
#
# Note that the Starlink functions wrapping getarg() are robust against
# getarg() failing because this information is not available.  This function
# is nonetheless necessary because some platforms have link problems otherwise
# (specifically OSX, on which the most readily available compiler is g77,
# cannot link properly if the getarg() function is referenced by a library,
# but there is a C main function, so that the Fortran main function's call of
# f_setarg is omitted).  Thus it is generally harmless to leave this function
# unimplemented on those platforms which do not have these link problems, and
# it is harmless that the test below is extremely compiler specific (though we
# would probably have to add implementations for any other compilers used on
# OSX).  It's also generally harmless not to call the defined function, or
# invoke this macro, if your application doesn't have the link problems which
# makeit necessary, though of course calling it will make getarg() work where
# it otherwise wouldn't, which may be an advantage.
#
# All was well until g95 and gfortran, these are "gnu" compilers, but use
# different semantics. In the case of g95 the calling the startup code is not
# optional (docs say that heap initialisation relies on the startup call).
#
# The test for g95 relies on the output from `g95 --version' containing the
# string "G95". Gfortran requires "GNU Fortran (GCC) 4+.x[x].x[x]".  Note that
# this whole area probably needs rethinking as g95 also has a g95_runtime_stop()
# function, that should be called.
#
# At gfortran 4.6 the call sequence stopped allowing a NULL argv, so a dummy
# version had to be added. The argv[0] value is always de-referenced in an
# an attempt to get the program name.
#
# Intel Fortran needs the for_rtl_init_ function, there is also a
# for_rtl_finish_ to run during closedown. The intel compiler signature
# is to have "IFORT" in the --version string.
#
# Under Solaris and the studio compilers the argc and argv values are no
# longer automatically shared, so we test for "Sun Fortran" and have a
# code section that copies the given argc and argv directly to the global
# variable __xargc and __xargv, this may need fixing from time to time.
# Doesn't seem to be a function for doing this job.
