  <description>The 2-D CCD Data Reduction Cookbook</description>
  <abstract><p>This cookbook presents simple recipes and scripts for
      reducing direct images acquired with optical CCD detectors.
      Using these recipes and scripts you can correct un-processed
      images obtained from CCDs for various instrumental effects to
      retrieve an accurate picture of the field of sky observed.  The
      recipes and scripts use standard software available at all
      Starlink sites.

      The topics covered include: creating and applying bias and
      flat-field corrections, registering frames and creating a stack
      or mosaic of registered frames.  Related auxiliary tasks, such as
      converting between different data formats, displaying images and
      calculating image statistics are also presented.

      In addition to the recipes and scripts, sufficient background
      material is presented to explain the procedures and techniques
      used.  The treatment is deliberately practical rather than
      theoretical, in keeping with the aim of providing advice on the
      actual reduction of observations. Additional material outlines
      some of the differences between using conventional optical CCDs
      and the similar arrays used to observe at infrared wavelengths.
