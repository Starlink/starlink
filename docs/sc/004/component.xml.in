  <description>C-shell Cookbook</description>
  <abstract><p>
      This cookbook describes the fundamentals of writing scripts
      using the UNIX C shell.  It shows how to combine Starlink and
      private applications with shell commands and constructs to
      create powerful and time-saving tools for performing repetitive
      jobs, creating data-processing pipelines, and encapsulating
      useful recipes.  The cookbook aims to give practical and
      reassuring examples to at least get you started without having
      to consult a UNIX manual.  However, it does not offer a
      comprehensive description of C-shell syntax to prevent you from
      being overwhelmed or intimidated.  The topics covered are: how
      to run a script, defining shell variables, prompting, arithmetic
      and string processing, passing information between Starlink
      applications, obtaining dataset attributes and FITS header
      information, processing multiple files and filename
      modification, command-line arguments and options, and loops.
      There is also a glossary.
