  <description>Simple Spectroscopy Reductions</description>
  <abstract><p>This Cookbook describes the basic concepts and methods used in
      optical astronomical spectroscopy; it is aimed at those new to
      the field. Complete worked example reductions for both 1-D and
      2-D longslit spectra, using real datasets, are described.
      Common problems and their solutions are discussed.  A section on
      related resources is included, as is a glossary of commonly used
      terms This cookbook presents simple recipes for the photometric
      calibration of CCD frames.  Using these recipes you can
      calibrate the brightness of objects measured in CCD frames into
      magnitudes in standard photometric systems, such as the
      Johnson-Morgan UBV, system. The recipes use standard software
      available at all Starlink sites.
