  <description>The GAIA Cookbook</description>
  <abstract><p>
     GAIA (Graphical Astronomy and Image Analysis) is an interactive
     astronomical image display and analysis tool.  It includes a
     comprehensive suite of facilities for displaying and manipulating
     images.  It also has extensive facilities for the astronomical
     analysis of images, including: astrometric calibration, automatic
     object detection and aperture, optimal and surface photometry.
     GAIA can access images in most of the data formats common in
     astronomy and can also retrieve copies of remote images and
     catalogues via the Internet.

     This cookbook is an introduction to GAIA.  It describes the
     facilities that GAIA provides and gives some simple examples of
     their use.  It refers to GAIA version 2.6 or higher.
