  <description>Theory and Modelling Resources Cookbook</description>
  <abstract><p>This cookbook is intended to assemble references to
      resources likely to be of interest to theorists and modellers.
      It's not a collection of standard recipes, but instead a
      repository of brief introductions to facilities.  It includes
      references to sources of authoritative information, including
      those Starlink documents most likely to be of interest to
      theorists.</p>

    <p>Although the topics are chosen for their
      relevance to theoretical work, a good proportion of the
      information should be of interest to all of the astronomical
      computing community.</p></abstract>
