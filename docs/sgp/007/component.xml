  <description>Unix and Starlink</description>
  <abstract><p>
     In order to exploit the most cost-effective hardware and to
     maintain compatibility with the international community, Starlink has
     begun introducing Unix-based computers.  A mixed Unix/VMS service, with
     its extra system management and software support costs, will not be
     efficient in the long term, and over the next few years the existing
     VMS service will run down and a complete change to Unix will occur.
     The details and timing of this transition will vary from site to site in
     accordance with local needs and conditions.  However, as far as possible
     all future hardware purchases will be Unix-based.  As representatives of
     the user community, the Starlink Users' Committee has worked closely
     with the Project in formulating these plans and firmly endorses them
