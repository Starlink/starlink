  <description>Procedure for reporting bugs</description>
  <abstract><p>
   The present procedure for reporting bugs in the Starlink Software
   Collection is thought by many to be unsatisfactory. The purpose of
   this document is to outline the procedures to be followed by the
   person discovering the bug, the Starlink Software Librarian and the
   person to whom the bug is reported. In the past, bug reports have
   seemed to disappear down a black hole, with a fix (maybe)
   appearing, without warning, sometime later. This was generally due
   to a lack of communication on all parts and it is hoped that the
   procedures outlined below will keep all users informed of the
   progress of a bug through the system.
