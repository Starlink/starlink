  <description>How to write good documents for Starlink</description>
  <abstract><p>
     This document gives advice on how to write good Starlink
     documents. It lists Starlink documents which users said they
     liked in the 1994 Starlink Software Survey, and identifies common
     characteristics of style and organisation which can be
     recommended to authors.

     Various features of documentation which the authors believe to be
     harmful are specified, including common problems with pages
     produced for the World Wide Web. Many of these will inevitably
     reflect the taste of the authors, and these may not correspond to
     your own. However, they derive from our belief that it is right
     for an author to spend time and effort on a document in order to
     save the reader time and effort in reading it.
