  <description>Starlink Software Maintenance Procedures</description>
  <abstract><p>
     This document sets out the steps involved in maintaining and
     developing the Starlink Software Collection.  The intended
     audience is all those involved in maintenance and development of
     Starlink software.  Some sections will be of particular relevance
     to programmers while other sections will be of interest to those
     involved in software distribution.

     It details the process from the passing of a bug report to the
     support programmer through to the final release of a fix to a
     package.  It also specifies the steps required for handling a new
     package, porting of existing packages to new platforms, and
     developing updates to packages.

     There are also sections on beta-testing packages, and the production of
     CD-ROMs.

     It does not cover Base Set software, nor does it detail the use of
     Starlink standard makefiles, and does not specify the mechanics of the
     procedures, which evolve with operational demands.
