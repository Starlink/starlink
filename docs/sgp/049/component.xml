  <description>Starlink's Support for PCs</description>
  <abstract><p>
     This paper outlines Starlink's policy on support for PCs.
     Essentially, we aim to use PCs as low-end multi-user workstations
     running Linux, a variant of Unix, and to integrate them with
     existing Unix systems.  We also aim to make most Starlink
     software available for the PC/Linux platform.

     Starlink's policy on support of PCs is likely to develop over the
     next few years.  Readers are therefore advised to check that they
     have the most up-to-date version of this document.  The policy
     outlined here was agreed by the Starlink Panel at their meeting
     in March 1996.
