    This note gives a general overview of the methods available for
    using Starlink Infrastructure subroutine libraries with
    applications.  There is an outline of how to use the include files
    for a subroutine library, and a guide to the methods available for
    linking with the subroutine libraries.

    All the Starlink Infrastructure libraries are organised in the
    same way, so it is possible to give a general guide to the
    principles involved.  However, some libraries do differ, and for
    precise details of how to use a particular subroutine library, you
    should consult the Starlink document for that library.
