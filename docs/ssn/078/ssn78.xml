<abstract>
<px>This document provides an introduction to the Starlink build
system.  It describes how to use the Starlink versions of the GNU
autotools (autoconf, automake and libtool), how to build the software
set from a checkout, how to add and configure new components, and acts
as a reference manual for the Starlink-specific autoconf macros and
Starlink automake features.</px>

<px>It does not describe the management of the CVS repository in
detail, nor any other source maintainance patterns.</px>

<px>It should be read in conjunction with the detailed build
instructions in the <code>README</code> file at the top of the source
tree (which takes precedence over any instructions in this document,
though there should be no major disagreements), and with <docxref
doc="SUN/248"/>, which additionally includes platform-specific notes.</px>

<title>Introduction</title>
</subhead>

<p>The Starlink build system consists of
<ul>

<li><p>the Starlink CVS repository;</p></li>

<li><p>build tools, consisting of modified versions of the GNU
autotools <code>autoconf</code> <code>automake</code> and
<code>libtool</code>;</p></li>

<li><p>configuration and bootstrap code, consisting of the
<code>starconf</code> system and the scripts at the top level of the
Starlink source tree; and</p></li> 

<li><p>the conventions for branching and tagging which are at present
only documented in the wiki, on the pages
<url>http://wiki.starlink.ac.uk/twiki/bin/view/Starlink/BranchingPolicy</url>
and
<url>http://wiki.starlink.ac.uk/twiki/bin/view/Starlink/CvsTagging</url>
(you will currently need a wiki account to see these pages).</p></li>

</ul>
</p>

      <p>The repository is on the machine
        <code>cvs.starlink.ac.uk</code> -- see
        <ref id="starlink-cvs"/> for further details.</p>

      <p>The build system is intended to cover two main cases.
        Firstly, it covers the problem of building code directly from
        the CVS repository, both when building the entire software set
        from scratch (as during the nightly test build for example),
        and when working on a development version of a particular
        component, within the context of an otherwise built software
        set.  This includes the problem of abiding by long-standing
        Starlink conventions on documentation, auxiliary tools and
        installation locations.  The build system at present is
        concerned primarily with the `classic' applications, which are the
        large volume of legacy Starlink code which, though it is no
        longer being developed, must still be maintained and be
        buildable by the community.  It has no contact with the large
        volume of Java code, apart from having the same tagging and
        branching conventions, since the building of the Java
        applications is currently completely handled by the
        <code>ant</code> system.</p>

      <p>Each component in the CVS repository is intended to be built
        separately, as opposed to being built only by a make running
        at the top of the tree.  Many components require other
        components to be installed, and the role of the top-level
        makefile is to manage these dependencies, when it is necessary
        to build the entire tree from scratch.  After a fresh CVS
        checkout, and presuming that any dependencies are in place,
        each component in the tree should be built with the sequence
        of commands
        <verbatim>
% ./bootstrap
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verbatim>
        The `install' target generated by Starlink automake installs
        the component as usual,
        but additionally creates a manifest file which is then installed in
        the <code>manifests/</code> subdirectory under the Starlink
        installation directory.  The building of the whole tree from
        scratch is described in <ref id="bootstrapping"/>, and the
        procedure to build a single component, though little more
        complicated than described here, is discussed in more detail
        in <ref id="buildingcomponents"/>.  You should read both of
        these sections before trying the commands above.</p>

      <p>Secondly, the build system handles the construction of
        portable source-code sets -- distribution
        tarballs<index>distribution</index> -- so that
        individual components can be built by users,
        from source, as straightforwardly as possible.  Since we are
        using the GNU autotools, much of this functionality comes for
        free, and we simply have to do the relatively small amount of
        configuration work required to ensure that the source set is
        complete (rather than requiring non-distributed build tools)
        and has clearly expressed dependencies between packages.  It
        is an absolute requirement that the build process for users
        must consist of no more than
<verbatim>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verbatim>
        with the usual options available for <code>./configure</code>
        and the usual relocations available for GNU-style makefiles.
        This document does not discuss building from a distribution
        tarball in any more detail than this, since there is really
        very little more detail to discuss.</p>

      <p>The system does not cover the precise mechanism by which these
        tarballs are distributed to users, nor the means by which they
        are informed of, or helped to satisfy, the dependencies
        between components; but in generating manifests and assembling
        the component dependency graph, it provides the information
        which such a distribution portal would need.</p>

      <p>In other sections of this document, we discuss the tools used
        to support developing within the CVS tree, including the
        specific starconf tools and an overview of the GNU autotools
        autoconf, automake and libtool (<ref id="tools"/>); we discuss
        the procedure for building applications within the repository
        (<ref id="building"/>); and we describe the process of
        adapting a currently working package to the build system's
        conventions (<ref id="autoconfing"/>).</p>

      <subsect id="entrypoints" export="export">
        <subhead>
          <title>Quick entry-points</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>The build system is intended to be a fairly integrated
          whole, and so this document is intended to be read straight
          through, rather than act purely as a reference manual.
          However it should be fairly well cross-referenced, and so
          depending on your motivations for reading this document,
          there is more than one reasonable entry-point.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>If you want to build and install a distributed source
                tarball, then you are probably reading the wrong
                manual, since this one contains rather more
                information than you need.  To build the distribution
                you should not need to do more than
                <code>./configure; make; make install</code> -- if you
                do need more than that, that's either a bug, or
                there's a readme you didn't read.  If you
                need to know more about the options to
                <code>./configure</code>, then <code>./configure
                --help</code> should provide that.  And if you really
                want or need the gory details, then <ref
                  id="configure-script"/> has them all.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If you want to start building and using software from
                the repository, then start with
                <ref id="starlink-cvs"/> or
                <ref id="buildingcomponents"/> and work outwards from
                there.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If you want to add another component to the
                repository, then you are probably going to have to
                read quite a lot of the document, but
                <ref id="autoconfingexample"/> and
                <ref id="importing-thirdparty"/> (and indeed most of
                <ref id="autoconfing"/>) are good places to start.</p>

        <title>Tools</title>
      </subhead>

      <p>This section is concerned with the tools which make up the 
        Starlink build system.  There are generally very few
        adjustments you need to make to the program source code
        (though the autotools can help you manage such things as
        installation directories and platform dependencies), and the
        changes you will make are to the auxiliary files which manage
        the build, most prominently the <code>configure.ac</code> file
        which organises the configuration, and the
        <code>Makefile.am</code> file which controls generating the
        makefile which does the work.</p>

      <p>The build system as a whole consists of a number of components:
        <dl>

          <dt>The Starlink autotools<index>autotools!Starlink changes</index></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>These consist of versions of the GNU autotools, which
              are part of the Starlink CVS repository, and which are
              built and installed as part of the top-level bootstrap.
              They should be installed in <code
                type="fspath">/star/buildsupport/bin</code>, or its
              equivalent if you have installed a set of tools in a tree
              other than <code>/star</code>.  Since they have been
              extended and customised, they are essential; you cannot
              build the Starlink collection without them.  There is an
              introduction to the autotools in <ref id="tooloverview"/>,
              covering their interrelationships and basic usage.</p>

            <p>We use (at the time of writing) an unmodified libtool,
              a moderately extended autoconf, and an extended and
              customised automake.  The description below explains the
              use of these tools as modified; see <ref id="gnutools"/>
              for details of the differences from the stock
              autotools.</p>

          </dd>

          <dt>The Starlink autoconf macros<index>autoconf</index></dt>
          <dd>

            <p>There is an extensive set of autoconf macros which
              support building Starlink applications.  You use these
              as you would any of the standard autoconf macros, by
              invoking them within the <code>configure.ac</code> file.</p>

            <p>The macros are described in detail in <ref
                id="starconfmacros"/>.</p>

            <p>The autoconf program which is used is not itself
              customised for Starlink use.  Instead, the macros are
              installed using the standard autoconf
              extension mechanism, which uses the application
              <em>aclocal</em>.  This is discussed in passing in <ref
                id="tooloverview"/>, and we mention it only in passing
              here.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>starconf<index>starconf</index></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This is the program which handles installing required
              macros, and configuring your directory ready to use
              the build system.  Associated with <em>starconf</em>
              is the <em>starconf-validate</em> program which checks
              that your directory is configured correctly, and the
              program <em>./starconf.status</em>, which unpacks
              required files, and allows you to make the link back
              to the configuration used to build the software.  All
              these are described in detail in <ref
                id="starconf"/>.</p>
          </dd>

        </dl>
      </p>

      <subsect id="tooloverview" export="export" indexkey="autotools">
        <subhead>
          <title>Overview of the Autotools</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>The autotools as a group help you create software
          distributions which will build reliably on a large variety
          of platforms.  They are most obviously associated with unix
          systems, but in fact support the larger class of POSIX
          systems which have an implementation of <code>/bin/sh</code>
          available -- a class which includes Windows machines,
          through the <webref url="http://www.cygwin.com/" >cygwin
            environment</webref>.</p>

        <p>The minimum required contact with the autotools is to
          generate the files which will let you configure a freshly
          checked-out directory before working on it, since these
          configuration files are not checked in to the repository.
          The <code>./bootstrap</code> script (see <ref
            id="starconf"/>) will do this for
          you, but it can only do this if the autotools are installed
          (see <ref id="bootstrappingonly"/>).</p>

        <p>The aim of the notes below is to give you an overview of
          autoconf and automake functionality, enough to make it
          possible for you to roughly understand the existing
          configuration files, and to make it easier to approach the full
          autoconf and automake documentation.  We start off with a
          broad overview, and provide a few further details in the
          subsections which follow.</p>

        <p>The two most obvious and important files are
          <code>configure.ac</code><index>configure.ac</index> and
          <code>Makefile.am</code><index>Makefile.am</index>.  The 
          first tells autoconf how to make the
          <code>./configure</code> script which does the actual
          configuration work, and which will be distributed with your
          package, the second (assuming you're using automake rather
          than hand-maintaining the input Makefile) tells automake how
          to create the template makefile <code>Makefile.in</code>,
          which is also distributed with your package, and which is
          edited by the <code>./configure</code> script to (finally!)
          produce the <code>Makefile</code> which (finally!) builds the
          code on the user's system.</p>

        <p>It's useful to illustrate the inputs and outputs of the
          various tools.  First are autoconf and automake:</p>

        <figure float="nofloat">
          <caption><px>Inputs to, and outputs from, autoconf</px></caption>
          <figurecontent image="fig-autoconf-png"/>
          <figurecontent image="fig-autoconf-gif"/>
          <figurecontent image="fig-autoconf-eps"/>
          <figurecontent image="fig-autoconf-pdf"/>
        </figure>

        <figure float="nofloat">
          <caption><px>Inputs to, and outputs from, automake</px></caption>
          <figurecontent image="fig-automake-png"/>
          <figurecontent image="fig-automake-gif"/>
          <figurecontent image="fig-automake-eps"/>
          <figurecontent image="fig-automake-pdf"/>
        </figure>

        <p>As you can see, although <code>configure.ac</code> is most
          associated with autoconf, automake reads it, too, to
          discover for example whether you have invoked
          <code>AC_PROG_LIBTOOL</code> or <code>STAR_MONOLITHS</code>,
          and so whether it needs to add the appropriate support in
          the generated <code>Makefile.in</code>.</p>

        <p>Once the <code>./configure</code> script is created, it is
          able to interrogate the system (the user's system, that is,
          not the developer's), and based on that edit the various
          <code>.in</code> files to produce their corresponding
          outputs.</p>

        <figure float="nofloat">
          <caption>
            <px>Inputs and outputs to configure</px>
          </caption>
          <figurecontent image="fig-configure-png"/>
          <figurecontent image="fig-configure-gif"/>
          <figurecontent image="fig-configure-eps"/>
          <figurecontent image="fig-configure-pdf"/>
        </figure>

        <p>This diagram for <code>./configure</code> shows a file
          <code>config.h.in</code><index>config.h.in</index> being
          edited.  This file -- which 
          we will have more to say about in <ref
            id="autoconfoverview"/> -- is a template list of C
          preprocessor definitions, which can be
          <code>#include</code>d in a C source file, and so used to
          configure the use of functions and definitions there.  Like
          any of the other <code>.in</code> files, it is possible to
          maintain this by hand, but it is more reliable to maintain
          it using another application
          <em>autoheader</em><index>autoheader</index>, which 
          looks as follows.</p>

        <figure float="nofloat">
          <caption>
            <px>Inputs and outputs to autoheader</px>
          </caption>
          <figurecontent image="fig-autoheader-png"/>
          <figurecontent image="fig-autoheader-gif"/>
          <figurecontent image="fig-autoheader-eps"/>

        <p>The other file we have not mentioned yet is
          <code>starconf.m4</code><index>starconf!location of
          macros</index>.  This file contains macros (in 
          the implementation language of autoconf, m4) which are
          used to extend autoconf's functionality, supplying the
          Starlink-specific autoconf support.  You will
          not typically have anything to do with this file, and we
          mention it only to indicate schematically where (some of)
          the Starlink magic comes from.  This file is not in your
          working directory, but is installed in the place the
          autotools expect to find it, by the <em>starconf</em>
          application described in <ref id="starconf"/>.  You may also
          notice a file <code>aclocal.m4</code><index>aclocal</index>
          in your directory. 
          This is a cache of autoconf macros, maintained by the
          autoreconf program; it should not be checked in.</p>

        <p>Of the applications mentioned above, automake, autoconf and
          (usually implicitly) autoheader are run on the developer's
          machine before or while making a distribution; thus the
          products of these programs, <code>./configure</code>,
          <code>config.h.in</code> and <code>Makefile.in</code>, are
          included in the distribution, and the <code>.in</code> files
          edited by the <code>./configure</code> script into the
          <code>config.h</code> and <code>Makefile</code> which
          actually control the build.</p>

        <p>We have elided some details here, for simplicity, and we
          could possibly have elided more, since you generally don't
          have to concern yourself with autoheader or
          <code>aclocal.m4</code>.  You don't even have to worry
          about the dependencies between these files and applications,
          since the <code>Makefile.in</code> which automake generates
          knows about these dependencies and will generally keep
          things up to date for you.  If you wish to be sure things
          are up to date, then you can simply run application
          <em>autoreconf</em> (see <ref id="autoreconf"/>), which
          knows enough about the relationships between them to run
          each of the required ones in the correct order.  This is
          likely the only one of the autotools commands which you will
          run yourself.</p>

        <p>For more details on the relationships between these
          applications, and fuller diagrams, see the online copy of the
          book <webref url="http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/" >`GNU
            Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool'</webref>, and in particular

          The autoconf manual is relatively clear, once you have a
          basic idea of what it's trying to do, but it's more
          effective as a reference manual than as a tutorial.  The
          automake manual should be regarded as a reference manual
          only: you might not guess from the manual, that 
          automake will make your life simpler, rather than full of
          anguish, suffering and confusion.  It doesn't really matter
          how good or bad the libtool manual is, since if you discover you
          have to look at it, you already know your future holds pain,
          and the manual isn't going to make things better or worse.

        <p>It's also worth looking at the <webref
            url="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_48.html">`Release
            Process'</webref> section of the GNU Coding Standards
          document.  Though we are not necessarily following these
          standards, this section both describes what is conventional
          packaging in the open-source world, and outlines the
          conventions which the autotools are designed to support.</p>

        <subsubsect id="autoconfoverview" indexkey="autoconf!overview">
          <subhead>
            <title>Autoconf</title>
          </subhead>

          <p>We use a slightly extended version of autoconf.  See
            <code>autoconf --version</code> for the base version number.</p>

          <p>The goal of autoconf is to help you make your program
            portable, by allowing you, at build time, to adapt the
            program to the facilities available on the machine on
            which the program is being built.</p>

          <p>You control this through a script called
            <code>configure.ac</code> (which was called
            <code>configure.in</code> in older versions of autoconf).
            The autoconf program produces from this a very portable
            <code>/bin/sh</code> script called <code>configure</code>,
            which is distributed as part of your package, and which
            the person building the package runs as the first part of
            the <kbd>./configure; make; make install</kbd>
            incantation.</p>

          <p>The <code>./configure</code> script probes the system it
            is running on, finding compilers, testing the behaviour of
            the local unix system, testing whether specific include files
            exist or not, testing whether required functions are
            available and working as expected, and managing some
            configuration by the user, such as allowing them to
            specify where the package is to be installed.</p>

          <p>This information is only useful if it can be communicated
            to your program in some way.  This is done by the
            configure script by editing the values of certain
            `substitution variables' into a list of template files.</p>

          <p>For example, you might have a version header
            file<index>version numbers</index>
            <code>version.h.in</code>, containing the line
<verbatim>
const char version[] = "@PACKAGE_VERSION@";
</verbatim>
            The configure variable <code>PACKAGE_VERSION</code> is one of those
            substituted by default, and if this file were listed as
            one of those to be substituted (by mentioning it in the
            autoconf macro
            <code>AC_CONFIG_FILES(version.h)</code><index>autoconf!macros!AC_CONFIG_FILES</index>), 
            then a file <code>version.h</code> would be created
            containing the contents of the <code>version.h.in</code>
            file with the <code>@PACKAGE_VERSION@</code> substituted by the
            version number declared within the
            <code>configure</code> file.</p>

          <p>Although this substitution process can be done for any
            template file, there are two template files which are used
            particularly often.</p>

          <p>The first is <code>Makefile.in</code>, which is a
            skeleton makefile which
            you might write by hand (though see the discussion of
            automake in <ref id='automakeoverview'/>).  There is an
            example of this at the top level of the Starlink build
            tree.  A typical <code>Makefile.in</code> might include
            lines like
<verbatim>
LN_S = @LN_S@
CC = @CC@
myfile.o: myfile.c
        $(CC) -o myfile.o myfile.c
</verbatim>
            That, combined with autoconf macros
            <code>AC_PROG_CC</code> and <code>AC_PROG_LN_S</code>,
            would allow you to produce a file <code>Makefile</code>
            which was customised to use the C compiler appropriate to
            the local environment, and which had, in the makefile
            variable <code>$(LN_S)</code><index>symbolic links</index>
            a command which makes links
            between files if the local platform supports that, or
            makes hard links or simple copies if that is all that is
            possible.</p>

          <p>As well as configuring the makefile, you may also want to
            configure the source code, so that you can take different
            actions in your code depending on whether certain
            functions or headers are available.  That is is most
            often done via a particular configured file,
            conventionally named <code>config.h</code>.  This second
            way of communicating with your source code has the
            <code>config.h</code> file substituted with a number of C
            preprocessor <code>#define</code> statements.  For
            example, if you included in your <code>configure.ac</code>
            file the lines
<verbatim>
AC_CHECK_HEADERS([sys/wait.h])
AC_CHECK_FUNCS([strchr])
</verbatim>
            then the configure script generated from that source would
            include a test of whether the <code>sys/wait.h</code>
            header file was available, and whether the
            <code>strchr</code> function was available in the C
            library.  If so, the resulting <code>config.h</code> file
            would include the lines
<verbatim>
#define HAVE_SYS_WAIT_H 1
#define HAVE_STRCHR 1
</verbatim>
            Whereas most configured files are substituted as a result
            of being mentioned in a <code>AC_CONFIG_FILES()</code>
            macro, the <code>config.h.in</code> input file is
            configured through
            <code>AC_CONFIG_HEADERS(config.h)</code>, which does its
            configuration in a slightly different way.</p>

          <p>After including this file into your source code with 
<verbatim>
#include &lt;config.h&gt;
</verbatim>
            you can adjust the compiled code with suitable
            <code>#if</code> preprocessor conditionals, such as
<verbatim>
#if HAVE_SYS_WAIT_H
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;
#endif
</verbatim></p>  

          <p>It is possible to maintain the <code>config.h.in</code>
            file by hand, but generally better to generate it by using
            the <em>autoheader</em> application which is part of
            autoconf.  This scans your <code>configure.ac</code> and
            extracts into <code>config.h.in</code> mentions of all those
            preprocessor defines it finds.  Autoheader knows about
            macros such as <code>AC_CHECK_HEADERS</code> above; if you
            wish to add further switches to the <code>config.h.in</code>
            file, you should do so by calling the autoconf macro
            <code>AC_DEFINE</code><index>autoconf!macros!AC_DEFINE</index>.  See the
            section <webref 
              url="&autoconfhtml;/autoconf_82.html" >7.1 Defining C
              Preprocessor Symbols</webref> in the autoconf manual for
            further details.  Autoheader is one of those applications
            run on your behalf by autoreconf (see <ref id="autoreconf"/>).</p>

          <p>Note the angle brackets round <code>config.h</code>: this
            is preferred to double quotes, as it gives the makefile the
            option of controlling where the source code is; in the
            simplest case this is handed by simply adding
            <code>-I.</code> to the compile line.  We don't take take
            advantage of this particular flexibility, but it is a good
            habit to get into.</p>

          <p>An illustrative
            <code>configure.ac</code><index>configure.ac!example</index>
            might look like this (with line numbers inserted):
<verbatim>
1   AC_INIT(mypack, 1.2, starlink@jiscmail.ac.uk)
2   AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR(src.c)
3   STAR_DEFAULTS
4   AC_PROG_CC
5   AC_PATH_PROG(PERL, perl)
6   AC_CHECK_HEADERS([sys/time.h])
7   STAR_MESSGEN(mypack_err.msg)
8   AC_CONFIG_HEADERS(config.h)
9   AC_CONFIG_FILES(Makefile)
10  AC_CONFIG_FILES(myscript.pl, [chmod +x myscript.pl])
11  AC_OUTPUT
</verbatim></p>

          <p>Line 1: This line is required.  It declares the package
            name, version number, and bug-report address.  Each of
            these is available for substitution via the substitution
            variables <code>PACKAGE_NAME</code>,

          <p>Line 2: This is largely a sanity check, and produces an
            error if the named file (in this case <code>src.c</code>)
            is not in the source directory.  The source directory is
            typically the current directory, but you can specify a
            different one using the <code>--srcdir</code> option to
            <code>./configure</code>, if you have a good reason for
            doing that.  <span media="all">See autoconf

            sets up the defaults required for building Starlink
            applications, and assures the <code>starconf</code>
            program that it's being run in the correct directory.  See
            <ref id='starconf'/> for a description of the starconf
            application, and <ref id="starconfmacros"/> for details of
            the associated macros.</p>

          <p>Line 4: This finds a working C compiler, and prepares to
            substitute it in the substitution variable
            <code>CC</code>.  Presumably the Makefile.in has a line

            current <code>PATH</code> and assign the substitution
            variable <code>PERL</code> the full path to it.  The most
            common way of using this would be for the file
            <code>myscript.pl.in</code> to start off with the line
<verbatim>
#! @PERL@ -w
</verbatim>
            so that the script ends up with the correct full path.

            <code>HAVE_SYS_TIME_H</code> is defined.  If this were a
            real configure file, you would likely have several other
            header tests here (in a space-separated list, surrounded
            by square brackets), and cpp branching inside your source
            code to handle the various cases.  See line 8<span

            declares that this package has a set of ERR messages in
            the given file, and that autoconf should check the
            location of the messgen application.  The argument is in
            fact optional (it merely causes the files to be declared
            as pre-distribution files -- see <ref
            id="macro-predist-sources" />); this line should be
            partnered by a declaration of the variable
            <code>include_MESSAGES</code> in the corresponding

            for fuller details.</p>

          <p>Line 8: This is the macro that makes cpp configuration
            information available, by editing the header file

            macro: a declaration like 
            <code>AC_DEFINE(SPECIALCASE,1)</code> would insert
            <code>#define SPECIALCASE 1</code> into the
            <code>config.h</code>; autoheader also spots this and puts
            a suitable template into <code>config.h.in</code>.  See
            the autoconf manual, section <webref

              preprocessor symbols</webref>, for further details.</p>

          <p>Line 9: This does the work of substituting the results of
            the various tests into the files being configured.  For each
            of the files named in the (space-separated list) argument,
            which most typically includes <code>Makefile</code>,
            autoconf expects to find a file of the same name but with
            <code>.in</code> appended, and this is the file which has
            the substitutions edited in.  (Automake also looks at this
            line, and if it sees a <code>Makefile</code> mentioned
            here, it looks to see if there is a corresponding
            <code>Makefile.am</code> already present, and if so, recurses)</p>

          <p>Line 10: This is a variant of line 9.  The
            <code>AC_CONFIG_FILES</code> macro takes a second argument
            consisting of one or more lines of shell script to
            post-process the file in question, in this case making
            sure that the generated file is executable.</p>

          <p>Line 11: This is the line which <em>really</em> does the
            work.  <span media='all'>See <webref

                Files</webref>.</span></p>

          <p>Of this script, it is lines 1, 2 and 11 which are
            absolutely required, along with something like line 9 to
            make the configure script do something useful.</p>

          <p>It is useful to think of the <code>configure.ac</code>
            file as being the template for the final
            <code>./configure</code> script, with the autoconf macros
            simply expanding to (large chunks of) shell script during
            translation by the autoconf program.  This isn't the whole
            truth, but it suffices for almost all purposes.  About the
            only place where this view might deceive you is if you
            wished to modify a file after it was generated by
            <code>AC_CONFIG_FILES</code> for example; if you did that
            immediately after the <code>AC_CONFIG_FILES</code> line it
            would fail, since the code which generates the files is
            in a different place from the <code>AC_CONFIG_FILES</code>
            line -- that is why <code>AC_CONFIG_FILES</code> has
            its second argument.  With this view it is natural that
            you can add any other shell scripting to your
            configure.ac, adding any tests and switches you fancy.
            You communicate the results of your scripting to the
            output files by making shell variables into substitution
            variables, and the way you do that is by calling
            <code>AC_SUBST</code> on them.  Thus, after
<verbatim>
wibble=''
... # lots of clever scripting
AC_SUBST(wibble)
</verbatim>
            any occurrences of the string <code>@wibble@</code> in the
            substituted files will be replaced by the value of
            <code>wibble</code> at the <em>end</em> of the
            <code>./configure</code> script.</p>

            <subhead>
              <title>M4 syntax and traps</title>
            </subhead>

            <p>Autoconf does its work by running the
              <code>configure.ac</code> file through the text processor
              GNU <code>m4</code>, and this can cause occasional
              surprises.</p>

            <p>M4 is a macro language, intended for very much the sort
              of rewriting that autoconf does.  When m4 processes a
              file, anything at all that looks like an m4 macro is
              substituted, so that there is no macro invocation
              character like the backslash in &tex;.  Macros can take
              arguments, delimited by round brackets and separated by
              commas, as illustrated above.</p>

            <p>The first oddity is to do with comment characters.  The
              default m4 comment character is <code>#</code>, but
              since this is also the shell script and makefile comment
              character, autoconf makes it an ordinary character.
              Thus to add comments to a <code>configure.ac</code> file
              which won't make it into the <code>./configure</code>
              file, you should prefix them with the m4 <em>macro</em>
              <code>dnl</code> (which means `delete to next newline'),
              as in
<verbatim>
dnl   This is a comment
AC_INIT(...)
</verbatim>
              There's no harm in including <code>#</code>-style
              comments in your <code>configure.ac</code> file and
              allowing these to be passed through to the output file,
              since `got-here' type comments can sometimes help you
              debug the <code>./configure</code> script.</p>

            <p>The default m4 quote characters are the left and right
              single quotes, but autoconf changes these to left and
              right square brackets.  You need to use these in two
              circumstances, firstly when you have a multi-word
              argument to a macro, and particularly when that argument
              contains a comma, and secondly if a piece of text looks
              like a current m4 macro.  In general, if you need to
              care about m4 quoting rules, you're in trouble, but see
              section <webref url="&autoconfhtml;/autoconf_90.html"
                >8.1 M4 Quotation</webref> in the autoconf manual, for
              some advice.</p>

        <subsubsect id='automakeoverview' indexkey="automake!overview">
          <subhead>
            <title>Automake</title>
          </subhead>

          <p>The most typical use of autoconf is to configure a file
            <code>Makefile.in</code>.  You can write this yourself, as
            described in <ref id='autoconfoverview' >the discussion of
              autoconf</ref>, but since so much of a typical makefile
            is boilerplate, automake exists to write this boilerplate
            for you.  This has the additional advantage that we can
            support and enforce Starlink-specific conventions with a
            customised installation of automake.  We (currently) use
            an adapted version of automake -- see <code>automake
              --version</code> for the version number, and <ref
              id="gnutools"/> for a summary of the differences.</p>

          <p>The file which controls automake is
            <code>Makefile.am</code><index>Makefile.am</index>.
            Automake reads both this file and 
            <code>configure.ac</code><index>configure.ac!and
            automake</index>, and based on these emits a 
            <code>Makefile.in</code>.  It is this latter file which
            you distribute, and which is substituted at build time by the 
            <code>./configure</code> script which autoconf generates
            in turn.</p>

          <p>The resulting <code>Makefile</code> has rules to do all
            the required building and installation in a very portable
            fashion, as well as targets to make distributions
            (<kbd>make dist</kbd>), do tests (<kbd>make
              check</kbd>), clean up (<kbd>make clean</kbd>,
            <kbd>make distclean</kbd> and <kbd>make
              maintainer-clean</kbd>) and, in the case of Starlink
            automake, do an install along with an installation
            manifest.</p>

          <p>The <code>Makefile.am</code> script consists, in its
            simplest form, of a sequence of declarations of the
            relationships between the source files in your
            distribution and the programs and libraries they are
            intended to produce.  For example, here is the
            <code>Makefile.am</code> for the PAR library, slightly edited:
            <verbatim>
## Process this file with automake to produce Makefile.in

lib_LTLIBRARIES = libpar_adam.la
libpar_adam_la_SOURCES = $(F_ROUTINES)

include_HEADERS = $(PUBLIC_INCLUDES)

F_ROUTINES = \
     par1_menu.f \
     par_cancl.f \
     [blah...]

PUBLIC_INCLUDES = \
    PAR_ERR \
    PAR_PAR \
    par.h \
    parwrap.h \
    par_err.h \
    par_par.h

BUILT_SOURCES = PAR_ERR par_err.h
</verbatim></p>

          <p>Overall, you can see that this automake source file is
            syntactically a makefile -- the statements in this example
            look like makefile variable settings, and it is possible
            to put makefile rules in the <code>Makefile.am</code>
            file, though that is not illustrated here.  This is
            slightly deceptive, however, and while it was useful to
            think, above, of the <code>configure.ac</code> file as
            being the template of the eventual
            <code>./configure</code> script, for automake you should
            think of the match between the input syntax and the
            makefile as a happy coincidence.  You provide information
            to automake through the <code>Makefile.am</code> file,
            and based on that it then emits the <code>Makefile.in</code> it
            thinks you want (or need, at least).</p>

          <p>The first line is a conventional comment.  It starts with
            a doubled hash mark <code>##</code>, which causes automake
            to discard the text after it; lines beginning with a
            single comment character are copied verbatim into the
            generated <code>Makefile.in</code>.</p>

          <p>The next stanza declares that there is to be a library
            <code>libpar_adam.la</code>, and that the sources for this
            file are in the `makefile variable'
            <code>F_ROUTINES</code>.</p>

          <p>Though the variables <code>F_ROUTINES</code> and
            <code>PUBLIC_INCLUDES</code> are specific to this
            makefile, and arbitrary, the other variable names have both
            structure and meaning for automake.</p>

          <p>The variable <code>lib_LTLIBRARIES</code> consists of the
            `prefix' <code>lib</code> and the `primary'
            <code>LTLIBRARIES</code><index>automake!prefixes and
            primaries</index>.  The primary tells automake that 
            you wish to build the libtool library
            <code>libpar_adam.la</code>, and the prefix indicates that
            this is to be installed with the other libraries (the
            variable <code>pkglib_LTLIBRARIES</code>, for example, would tell
            automake that you wanted to install the result in a
            package-specific library).  For each of the libraries
            listed in this variable, separated by spaces, there must
            be a corresponding <code>_SOURCES</code> variable, which
            has the `primary' <code>SOURCES</code> and a prefix
            formed from the library name, which lists
            the set of source files for that library.
            The prefix must be canonicalised by replacing
            with underscores everything other than letters and numbers.
            As well as declaring the files which are to be compiled
            into the library, this
            indicates to automake that these source files are to be
            distributed as part of the final tarball, and that it must
            emit makefile rules to install the library in the correct
            place, with the correct installation commands.
            For the list of such associated primaries, see section <webref
              url="&automakehtml;/Program-and-Library-Variables.html"
              >Program and Library Variables</webref> of the automake
            documentation.</p>

          <p>By default, libtool builds both static and shared
            libraries<index>shared libraries</index>.  You can control
            this if necessary with the <code>--enable-shared</code>
            and <code>--disable-shared</code>
            options to <code>./configure</code>, and with the
            <code>AC_DISABLE_SHARED</code> autoconf variable.  For
            further details see the
            documentation for <code>AC_PROG_LIBTOOL</code> in the
            <webref url="&libtoolman;" >Libtool manual</webref>.</p>

          <p>If we only wanted to build static libraries, we would
            replace this line with <code>lib_LIBRARIES =
              libpar_adam.a</code>, and the given library would be
            built in the usual way, without involving libtool.</p>

          <p>The <code>LIBRARIES</code> and <code>LTLIBRARIES</code>
            primaries can have any one of the prefixes
            <code>libdir</code>, <code>pkglibdir</code>,
            <code>check</code> or <code>noinst</code>, with the latter
            indicating that the library should be built but not
            installed.  Having non-installed libraries can be useful
            when you are building a library conditionally, or in stages.
            Libtool refers to these as `convenience libraries', and they
            are discussed in section <webref
              url="&automakehtml;/Libtool-Convenience-Libraries.html"
              >Libtool Convenience Libraries</webref> of the automake
            manual.</p>

          <p>The other very important primary (not shown here) is
            <code>PROGRAMS</code>, which describes programs which are to
            be built and installed (the special Starlink case of
            monoliths is described below).  This can have the prefixes
            <code>bin</code>, <code>sbin</code>, <code>libexec</code>,
            <code>pkglib</code>, <code>check</code> or
            <code>noinst</code>: <code>check</code> is for tests, and is
            described in <ref id="regressiontests"/>;
            <code>noinst</code> indicates that the program should be
            built but not installed, and is useful for programs which
            are used during the build -- for generating header files for
            example -- but which are not part of the final product.
            There is no single standard list of prefixes, since each
            primary supports only a subset of them (you cannot declare
            <code>bin_LIBRARIES</code>, for example), but several are
            mentioned in automake's <webref
              url="&automakehtml;/Install.html" >What Gets
              Installed</webref>, and the directories in question are
            discussed in autoconf's <webref
              url="&autoconfhtml;/autoconf_24.html" >4.7.2 Installation
              Directory Variables</webref>.</p>

          <p>The <code>include_HEADERS</code> line is similar: it
            indicates that the listed files are to be distributed, and
            are to be installed in the correct place for include
            files.</p>

          <p>The final line which is significant to automake is the
            <code>BUILT_SOURCES</code>
            line<index>BUILT_SOURCES</index>.  This says that, even 
            though <code>PAR_ERR</code> and <code>par_err.h</code> are
            to be installed and distributed, they are not actually
            genuine source files, but must be built; adding the
            <code>BUILT_SOURCES</code> line forces automake to add a
            dependency for these files at an artificially early stage.
            It is only rather rarely
            necessary to include a line like this.  If one of the
            source files were in this category, then it would
            naturally be built when it was required, without any
            need to add it to <code>BUILT_SOURCES</code>.  As it happens,
            there is no rule in this file for building these targets;
            that is added automatically by automake when it spots that
            the <code>STAR_MESSGEN</code> macro has been used in the
            <code>configure.ac</code> file which partners this
            <code>Makefile.am</code>.  In a more general case,
            however, you would add a make-style rule to the
            <code>Makefile.am</code> file to build these files from
            their (presumably undistributed) sources.  See also <webref
              url="&automakehtml;/Sources.html" >Built sources</webref> in
            the automake manual.</p>

          <p>For a second example, we can look at the
            <code>Makefile.am</code> for the <code>sst</code>
            application (this is a non-distributed application for
            building documentation).

          <p>This makefile configures and installs a script, builds
            and installs a monolith, and adds some supporting data
            files in a non-standard place.</p>

          <p>The <code>SCRIPTS</code> primary indicates to automake
            where and how to install the <code>start</code> script.
            The <code>start</code> script must be generated, since it
            is to include the version number and installation
            location.  Since it includes the installation location, it
            should <em>not</em> be generated at configure time or
            install time, but instead at make time, so that the user
            is free to specify one installation prefix at configure time
            (through <kbd>./configure --prefix=www</kbd>), override
            this with another prefix at build time (through
            <kbd>make prefix=xxx</kbd>) and specify a
            <em>different</em> one -- presumably a staging location or
            something similar -- at installation time (through
            <kbd>make prefix=yyy install</kbd>).  It is the prefix at
            <em>build</em> time that is to be baked into the code, if
            any such baking has to be done.  This is one of the GNU
            conventions mentioned in <ref id="tooloverview"/>, and is
            discussed in a little more detail in section
            <webref url="&autoconfhtml;/autoconf_24.html">4.7.2
              Installation Directory Variables</webref> of the autoconf
            manual.  This is why we have to include a makefile-style
            rule for deriving the file <code>start</code> from its
            template <code>start.in</code>.  This substitutes in the
            values of the makefile variables <code>bindir</code> and
            <code>VERSION</code>; these get their values, in the
            resulting <code>Makefile</code>, by having those values
            substituted in to the generated <code>Makefile.in</code>
            by the generated <code>./configure</code> script; the
            careful escaping of the @-signs in the sed command is to
            match the <code>@...@</code> in <code>start.in</code>
            while <em>not</em> matching this in
            <code>Makefile.am</code> or the resulting
            <code>Makefile.in</code> (yes, this can get a little
            confusing).</p>

          <p>This <code>Makefile.am</code> also declares a single
            monolith (this and the <code>TASKS</code> primary below
            are obviously part of the Starlink extensions to automake)
            and its associated <code>SOURCES</code>, along with its
            component tasks.  For fuller details of the monoliths
            support, see <ref id="monoliths"/>.  This incidentally
            illustrates that automake allows variable reuse and
            rewriting very similar to that supported by make.</p>

          <p>When we are linking this monolith, we need to add a
            couple of link options, and we do this with a
            <code>LDADD</code> primary associated with the
            <code>sst_mon</code> prefix.  The extra link options we
            declare here are added to the eventual link command,
            replacing the default set of option
            options <code>$(LDADD)</code>, so we include that variable
            in our version.  We also add <code>`fio_link`</code>,
            because this monolith needs to be linked against the FIO
            library (automake constrains what can appear in the
            <code>LDADD</code> variable, and the
            <code>`fio_link`</code> is permissable only in Starlink
            automake -- see <ref id="gnutools"/> for details).</p>

          <p>The variables <code>SUBSRC</code>, <code>SUBCSRC</code>
            and <code>PRIVATE_INCLUDES</code> are purely user
            variables, with no special meaning to automake.</p>

          <p>The next bit of magic in this file is
            <code>sstsupport_DATA</code><index>directories!special</index>.
            In this particular case, we
            want to install data files in the same location as the
            binaries (why, and whether this is a good thing, is not
            for us to worry about here).  The obvious thing
            would be to say <code>bin_DATA = sun.tex ...</code>,
            but automake forbids that particular combination of prefix
            and primary, precisely because it wouldn't generally make
            sense (see <webref url="&automakehtml;/Data.html"
              >Architecture-independent data files</webref> in the
            automake manual).  Instead, we can take advantage of an
            escape-hatch that automake provides: a given prefix, such
            as <code>sstsupport</code>, is valid if you also define a
            variable of the same name, but with <code>dir</code>
            appended.  Thus we define <code>sstsupport_DATA</code> and
            <code>sstsupportdir</code>, and define the latter to have
            the same value as the <code>$(bindir)</code> makefile
            variable, as eventually substituted (see section <webref
              url="&automakehtml;/Uniform.html" >The Uniform Naming
              Scheme</webref> in the automake manual).</p>

          <p>If you look at the real <code>sst</code> component's
            <code>Makefile.am</code> file, you will see that it does
            in fact use <code>bin_DATA</code> rather than the
            <code>sstsupport_DATA</code> illustrated above.  This is
            because the <code>configure.ac</code> in the
            <code>sst</code> component declares the option
            <code>STAR_DEFAULTS(per-package-dirs)</code><index>per-package-dirs</index>
            (see <ref
              id="macro-defaults"/>) which,
            amongst a couple of other magic features, causes the
            variable <code>bin_DATA</code><index>DATA
            primary!bin_DATA</index> to become legal.</p>

          <p>This is a rather special case, and you should not have to
            do this sort of semi-licensed hacking very often.  In
            particular, you do not need to do it in the case of the
            Starlink standard directories <code>/star/docs</code>,
            <code>/star/etc</code>, <code>/star/examples</code> and
            <code>/star/help</code>, since
            you can give these directories as prefixes to the
            <code>DATA</code> primary.  As an example, the HDS
            makefile installs a file containing the information it has
            determined about the build machine's floating point model,
            and this is declared there as follows:
<verbatim>
noinst_PROGRAMS = hds_machine
starhelp_DATA = hds_machine.txt

hds_machine_SOURCES = hds_machine.f
hds_machine_LDADD = libhds.la `ems_link` `chr_link` `cnf_link`

hds_machine.txt: hds_machine
        ./hds_machine >$@
</verbatim>
            This is enough to build the <code>hds_machine</code>
            application at install time, run it, and install the
            results in <code>/star/help</code> (with the obvious
            changes for prefixes <code>stardocs</code>,
            <code>staretc</code> and <code>starexamples</code>).</p>

          <p>The remaining magic in this file is the
            <code>EXTRA_DIST</code><index>distribution!EXTRA_DIST</index> variable.
            For all its cleverness, 
            automake cannot work out that the <code>start.in</code>
            source, nor any of the <code>sstsupport_DATA</code> files
            are to be distributed, and you need to declare that
            explicitly by setting the <code>EXTRA_DIST</code>
            variable.  Though it is of course deterministic (see
            section <webref url="&automakehtml;/Dist.html" >What Goes
              in a Distribution</webref> of the manual), I find the
            most straightforward way to work out whether anything
            needs to go here is to build a distribution and spot what
            was missed out.</p>

<p>We are using unmodified Libtool.  See <code>libtool
--version</code> for the actual version.</p>

<p>Libtool contains the darkest magic of the autotools, so it is
fortunate that we need barely concern ourselves with it.  This is
because all of the technicalities of calling libtool are handled for
us by the makefile generated by automake.</p>

<p>The function of libtool is to build libraries.  While this is
generally straightforward for static libraries, usually involving
little more than working out whether <code>ranlib</code> is necessary,
doing the same thing for dynamic libraries is extremely platform
dependent.  Libtool consists of a large body of platform-dependent
code, ported to a broad range of operating systems, which implements a
single platform-independent interface.</p>

<p>For more details, see the libtool manual at
<url>&libtoolman;</url>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, libtool's library magic introduces a minor
complication when you wish to run a program under a debugger<index
>libtool!debugging executables</index><index seealso="libtool,
debugging executables" >debugging</index>: plain <kbd>gdb
myprog</kbd> won't work, and you must instead use <kbd>libtool

          <p>You don't have to know anything very much about
            <code>autoreconf</code><index>autoreconf</index>, other
            than that, if you change one
            of the autotools files <code>Makefile.am</code> or

            <code>autoreconf</code> to bring everything up to date.  In
            fact, you probably don't even need that, since the generated
            makefiles have these dependencies explicit.  The problem
            that <code>autoreconf</code> addresses is that when one of
            these files is updated, there are

          <subhead>
            <title>Running ./configure</title>
          </subhead>

          <p>Running the configure script is basically very simple:
            <kbd>./configure</kbd>.  There are, however, options and
            arguments which can help you, or catch you out.  You can
            see the full list of options with the command
            <kbd>./configure --help</kbd>.</p>

<p>You set the place where the configured component will be installed
with the <code>--prefix</code> option.  This names a directory which
will end up with the standard directories <code>bin</code>,
<code>manifests</code> and so on.  The default is reported by
<kbd>./configure --help</kbd>, and is ultimately controlled by
<em>starconf</em> (see <ref id="bootstrappingonly"/> and <ref
id="tool-state"/>; or <ref id="starconf-default-variables"/> for a
means of setting it to a per-directory default, which can be useful in
certain circumstances).</p>

<p>Because configure's tests potentially take quite a long time to
run, it is possible to cache the results between runs.  If you add an
option <code>-C</code>, then these results will be cached in a file
<code>config.cache</code> in the current directory.  When you do the
tree-wide configure from the top level, it is important to give this
option, otherwise the configure step takes an unconscionably long
time.  When this is happening, the configure runs in subdirectories
use the cache file in the top-level directory, and when you are
running configure in subdirectories, you can use this global cache,
too.  If you are in a directory two levels down from the top (say),
then you can configure slightly faster using the command
<verbatim>
% ./configure --config-cache=../../config.cache
</verbatim>
This reads and updates the given cache file.  Sometimes, when things
get a little confused, you might need to delete this cache file --
this is always safe.</p>

          <p>The Starlink autoconf adds a couple of extra standard
            options.<dl>
              <dt><code>--with-starlink[=location]</code><index>configure!options!--with-starlink</index></dt>
              <dd>
                <p>If no <code>location</code> is provided, this does
                  nothing.  This is effectively the default.</p>
                <p>If a <code>location</code> is provided, it
                  overrides the STARLINK environment variable which will
                  be used.  Very rarely needed.</p>
                <p>Option <code>--without-starlink</code> causes the
                  <code>STARLINK</code> shell variable to be unset.
                  Some packages might with to configure themselves
                  differently in this case.</p>
              </dd>
              <dt><code>--without-stardocs</code><index>configure!options!--without-stardocs</index></dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Controls whether documentation is built and
                installed.  You might want to turn this off, since it
                can take quite a long time.  The default is
                <code>--with-stardocs</code>, and so you can disable
                this with the configure option
                <code>--without-stardocs</code>.</p>
              </dd>
            </dl>
</p>

          <p>A <em>few</em> components have extra options on the
            <code>./configure</code> command.  For example, the
            component <code>docs/ssn/078</code> (the component which
            holds this document) has a <code>--with-pstoimg</code>
            option, the value of which must be the full path to a copy
            of the <code>pstoimg</code> program, to help in the cases
            where this cannot be discovered automatically (this may be
            a temporary feature of this component).</p>

          <p>All of the components have ``Some influential environment
            variables''<index>environment variables</index> listed in
            the help message.  This will include
            at least <code>STARLINK</code><index>environment
            variables!STARLINK</index>, and in the (very common!) case
            of components which include a compiler, an 
            environment variable such as
            <code>CC</code><index>environment variables!CC</index> or
            <code>FC</code><index>environment variables!FC</index>
            which allows you to override the compiler 
            which the configure script will find.  This is useful
            if you want to avoid a default compiler and use a specific
            one instead.  For example, if you wished to use
            the Sun C++ compiler specifically (while on a Sun,
            obviously), you would put <code>/opt/SUNWspro/bin</code>
            in your path, and set the <code>CXX</code> variable:
<verbatim>
% export CXX=CC   # best avoided
% ./configure
</verbatim>
            or
<verbatim>
% env CXX=CC ./configure   # best avoided
</verbatim>
            where the latter is probably preferable, inasmuch as it
            does not leave this important variable set, in such a way
            that it can make a difference unexpectedly.</p>

          <p>Better than either of these is
<verbatim>
% ./configure CXX=CC
</verbatim>
            This doesn't set <code>CXX</code> as an environment
            variable, but sets it in a similar-looking way as one of the
            <code>./configure</code> arguments.  This way is
            preferable to either of the above for two reasons:
            firstly, it does not leave the 
            variable set; secondly, this way <code>./configure</code>
            `knows' that the compiler has been overridden, so that if
            you are using a configure cache, and
            you <em>fail</em> to do this when the directory is
            reconfigured, <code>./configure</code> can warn you of
            this, in case this is not deliberate.</p>

          <p>If you change one of these variables between runs, and
            are using a configure cache, then the
            <code>./configure</code> script will warn you like this:
<verbatim>
% ./configure -C
configure: loading cache config.cache
configure: error: `STARLINK' has changed since the previous run:
configure:   former value:  /somewhere/else
configure:   current value: /export3/sun
configure: error: changes in the environment can compromise the build
configure: error: run `make distclean' and/or `rm config.cache' and start over
</verbatim>
            To deal with this, simply remove the
            <code>config.cache</code> file, check that the environment
            variable is indeed set as you wish, and rerun
            <code>./configure</code>.</p>

<p>You can pass options to the compiler using environment variables,
but you will <em>not</em> need to do this in general, other than
perhaps to set <code>CFLAGS=-g</code><index>environment
variables!CFLAGS</index><index>debugging</index> to turn on debugging
in the code you are building.  The variables <code>CFLAGS</code> and
<code>LDFLAGS</code> are variables you might potentially set and
export in the environment, for example to point
<code>./configure</code> to software installed in non-standard places
(perhaps you are on a Mac and have installed Fink in <code>/sw</code>
or OpenDarwin in <code>/opt/local</code>, or are on a Sun and have
extra software in <code>/opt</code>).  In this case you might set
<code>CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include</code> and
<code>LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib</code> in the environment to help
configure and the compiler find libraries.  Note that this is rather a
blunt instrument, and because you cannot really control where the
respective flags appear in generated compiler commands, you can end up
picking up inconsistent versions of software.  That is, this is a
mechanism for getting yourself out of a fix, not a recommended way of
building the software.<index>environment
variables!warnings</index></p>

          <p>The important point of this is that these environment variables
            <em>do matter</em>, and implicitly <em>change the
              behaviour of <code>./configure</code></em>.  You should
            not have them set in your environment if you don't want
            this to happen.</p>

          <p>The values you set here act as defaults in the Makefile,
            and can be overriden at make time by giving arguments to
            make:
<verbatim>
% make 'CFLAGS=-g -I/somewhere/else'
</verbatim></p>

          <title>Starconf, and the Starlink autoconf macros</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>The starconf application does some of the work of
          ensuring that your build directory is correctly
          organised.  It does the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>ensures that you have a <code>./bootstrap</code>
                script;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>runs the
                <em>starconf-validate</em><index>starconf-validate</index>
                application to
                check that your <code>configure.ac</code> and 
                <code>Makefile.am</code> files look at least
                plausible by checking, amongst other things, for the
                presence of a <code>STAR_DEFAULTS</code> invocation
                in the former, and to check that the right files have
                been checked in to the repository;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>creates the script
                <code>./starconf.status</code><index>starconf-status</index>,
                which allows you to inspect some of the starconf
                parameters.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The <code>./bootstrap</code> script is `owned' by
          starconf, and you should not change it, since it will be
          overritten by starconf if a newer release of starconf
          includes an updated bootstrap script.  If you <em>do</em>
          have some pressing reason to change it, then remove the word
          `original' from the second line of the bootstrap file, which
          signals to starconf that it should leave the file
          untouched.  The standard bootstrap script:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>runs <em>starconf</em>, using
                <code>./starconf.status</code> if necessary to find
                the path to the program;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>bootstraps any subdirectories named in the
                <code>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</code> macro within
                <code>configure.ac</code>;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>runs <em>autoreconf</em><index>autoreconf</index> to
                regenerate configuration 
                files if necessary.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>You need to run starconf explicitly only once, when you
          first prepare a directory for configuration.  The
          <code>./bootstrap</code> file which this creates itself
          runs starconf, so that each time you run the bootstrap
          script, you run starconf also.  This has no effect unless
          either the bootstrap script or the macro set has been
          updated in the starconf installation, in which case starconf
          will propagate the updates to your directory.
          The <code>./starconf.status</code> script should not be
          checked into the repository.  The command
          <code>starconf-validate</code> (which is
          invoked by <code>starconf</code> in passing but which may be
          invoked explicitly also) will tell you what should and
          shouldn't be checked in.</p>

        <p>You might on other occasions run the
          <code>./starconf.status</code>
          script<index>starconf.status</index>.  You will do this 
          firstly to query important locations, such as the location
          of the starconf templates:
<verbatim>
% ./starconf.status --show buildsupportdata
/export3/sun/buildsupport/share
</verbatim>
          See <kbd>./starconf.status --show --all</kbd> or
          <kbd>./starconf.status --help</kbd> for the list
          of all the things which you can show in this way (though
          be warned that this list is not yet completely stable, and
          may yet change).</p>

        <p>These variables are fixed for a particular installation of
          starconf (you can in principle have more than one
          installation of starconf, and choose which one to invoke,
          but there is unlikely any need for that).</p>

<p>Two very important variables are
<code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</code> and
<code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</code>, discussed in <ref
id="starconf-default-variables"/> below.</p>

        <p>A companion to the starconf application is the
          <em>starconf-validate</em><index>starconf-validate</index>
          application.  When run, this
          examines the current directory, checking that all required
          files are present, and checking that you have the correct
          files checked in to the repository.  The command
          <kbd>starconf-validate --help</kbd> shows which files are
          in which category.  Note that this applies only to
          directories which are fully Starlink applications -- those
          in the <code>libraries</code> and
          <code>applications</code> directories; components
          in the <code>thirdparty</code> tree, on the other hand,
          have some starconf features such as a
          <code>component.xml</code> file, but are not valid
          according to <em>starconf-validate</em>; also `bundle'
          directories such as <code>libraries/pcs</code>, which have
          no actual code in them, are not valid in this sense.</p>

        <p>There are templates available for the most important
          starconf files.  See <ref id="templates"/>.</p>

        <p>The final component of the starconf system is the file
          <code>component.xml</code><index>component.xml</index>.
          This is an XML file
          containing information about the particular component in
          the directory.  The information in this file is redundant
          with some of the information you specify in
          <code>configure.ac</code>, and so the best way to ensure
          the two are consistent is to configure
          <code>component.xml</code> from
          <code>configure.ac</code>.  To this end, there is a
          template
          <code>component.xml.in</code><index>component.xml!template</index>
          file in the starconf
          `buildsupportdata' directory.  When you are preparing a
          directory to be build with the Starlink tools, copy this
          <code>template-component.xml.in</code> into the current
          directory under the name <code>component.xml.in</code>,
          and fill in those field which are not configured.  Remember
          to uncomment the elements you fill in!  See
          <ref id="componentxml"/> for details.  The files
          <code>component.xml</code> and
          <code>component.xml.in</code> should both be
          checked in.</p>

<title><code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</code> and
<code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</code></title>
</subhead>

<p>Two very important variables are
<code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</code><index>environment
variables!STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</index> and
<code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</code><index>environment
variables!STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</index>.  The first is the default
installation prefix of the software you are building; the second is
the location of a currently built Starlink tree, which will be used
for applications and include files if they are not found under
<code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</code>.</p>

<p>The value for each of these was frozen when starconf was itself
built and installed, most typically at the time of the tree-wide
bootstrap, and you can see the values for these with the command
<kbd>starconf --show STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</kbd> for example.  You
can also see the results of this configuration in the
<code>./configure</code> script itself, as the command
<kbd>./configure --help</kbd> indicates within its output where
material will be installed by default.  It is not unreasonable to have
more than one starconf installation, depending on your path, if you
wish to have different frozen-in defaults here.  The value of each of
these two variables is typically something like
<code>/star</code>.</p>

<p>It is important to emphasise that these parameters are
<em>frozen</em> when starconf is built, and their values are ignored
when a component is itself bootstrapped.  If you need to change either
value, then there are two ways you can do this.</p>

<p>The first, much more common, way is to provide the
<code>--prefix</code> option when you run <code>./configure</code> in
a component (this overrides the frozen-in value of
<code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</code>), or you can set the
<code>STARLINK</code> variable<index>environment
variables!STARLINK</index> as a <code>./configure</code> argument line
(or less securely default it from the environment, see <ref
id="configure-script"/> for discussion), overriding the frozen-in
value of <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</code>.</p>

<p>Specifying <code>--prefix</code> or <code>STARLINK</code> each time you run
<code>./configure</code> might be troublesome when you are working on
a component's configuration script, especially as doing this
inconsistently would produce very confusing
results.<index>installation!setting prefix</index>  You might want
to do this if you are working on a repository branch, and so want
built material from the current directory to be installed in one
branch-specific place, while using a Starlink tree based on the trunk.
You can default this on a per-directory basis by using a m4 back-door.
Create a file <code>acinclude.m4</code><index>acinclude.m4</index> in
the directory in question, and include in it a line like:
<verbatim>
m4_define([OVERRIDE_PREFIX],[/my-branch/star])
</verbatim>
(or <code>OVERRIDE_STARLINK</code> to override that variable).  Then
run <code>./bootstrap</code>, which invokes `autoreconf' in turn, and
the generated <code>./configure</code> file will have the named directory
as its default prefix.  This method is in principle
fragile, and uses a partly-deprecated autoconf interface,
and so is not guaranteed to work for all time.  It is at present adequately
robust in practice, however, and so is a respectable technique as long
as you are aware that it is to some extent a rather special effect.
</p>

<p>In general, however, we recommend that you do not adjust
<code>--prefix</code>, and that you leave the
<code>STARLINK</code> variable unset.  Also, since they are ignored at
all times except when the whole tree is being configures, it might be
wise <em>not</em> to have the <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_...</code>
variables set, which could trick you into believing that they are
(not) having some effect.</p>

            <title>Components</title>
          </subhead>

          <p>Throughout this documentation, the term `component' is
            used rather than `package'.  The distinction is that the
            components are the units of organisation within the CVS
            tree, and the packages are the units which are distributed
            as tarballs.  These will generally overlap, but the
            mapping may not be one-to-one, so that the components
            within the CVS tree might not be reflected in ultimately
            distributed packages.</p>

          <p>A `component directory' is a directory which has a
            <code>component.xml.in</code> file in it.  All component
            directories will have a manifest file created and
            installed in <code>.../manifests</code>; non-component
            directories will not have manifest files.  Everything
            that's installed must be installed as part of some
            component or other.  This helps when you want to remove a
            component (a <em>very</em> primitive de-installer is
            therefore <code>rm -f `sed
            '1,/&lt;files&gt;/d;/&lt;\/files&gt;/,$d'
            .../manifests/XXX`</code>), and packaging for distribution
            should be easy.</p>

          <p>The starconf <code>./bootstrap</code> scripts, which are
            installed by the starconf application, recurse into the
            directories listed in a <code>configure.ac</code> file's
            <code>AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR</code> macro, and will stop recursing
            when they find a <code>component.xml.in</code> file.
            They'll warn if they find a <code>component.xml.in</code>
            file in any <code>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</code> directory, but
            ignore it, and exit with an error if they do not find a
            <code>component.xml.in</code> file and there are no
            <code>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</code> directories in which to
            search further.  That is, the tree of directories which
            the top-level bootstrap traverses should have
            <code>component.xml.in</code> files at or above all its
            leaves.</p>

          <p>This further implies that a component `owns' all the tree
            beneath the component directory, and thus that you cannot
            have one component located within another.</p>

          <p>This means that bootstrap files only have to appear
            within component directories, but not their children, and
            starconf/autoreconf and starconf-validate only have to be
            run in component directories.  Macros like
            <code>STAR_DEFAULTS</code> are still usable in the
            subdirectories' component.ac files (because auto(re)conf
            in the parent handles those macros when it remakes the
            child configures).</p>

          <p>Automake spots <code>component.xml.in</code> files and
            will only arrange to install a component manifest if it
            does fine a <code>component.xml.in</code> file.  It also
            demands that the <code>STAR_SPECIAL_INSTALL_COMMAND</code>
            macro (see <ref id="macro-special-install-command"/>)
            appear only in configure.ac files in a component directory
            (that macro is a sufficiently magic blunt instrument that
            it shouldn't be allowed to lurk where it can't have an eye
            kept on it).</p>

          <p>The <code>starconf-validate</code> script checks these
            various assertions.  As usual,
            <code>starconf-validate</code> should be regarded as
            pickily authoritative about how things are ideally
            configured, and if it objects to something, that means
            either that the the directory in question is non-ideally
            configured (and should be fixed), or the part of SSN/78
            that suggested you set things up that way is out-of-date
            or unclear and should be clarified.</p>

        <p>The only place where you should specify a version
          number is as the second argument to the
          <code>AC_INIT</code> macro; if you need the version
          number anywhere else, such as a bit of code which
          reports the package version number, you should put it
          there with the <code>@PACKAGE_VERSION@</code>
          substitution variable<index>autoconf!substitution
            variables!PACKAGE_VERSION</index>, or one of the
          variants of this defined by <code>STAR_DEFAULTS</code>
          (see <ref id="macro-defaults"/>).</p>

        <p>Starlink follows the usual practice of indicating
          release versions with a three-part version number,
          major.minor-release.  We have no particularly precise
          rules controlling these, but the major version number is
          typically incremented for a release which contains a
          major change in functionality or implementation, the
          minor is incremented for changes of functionality less
          significant than this, and the release number is
          incremented for bugfix releases, involving no
          functionality changes at all.</p>

        <p>If a component contains a shared library, then the
          maintainer may elect to maintain shared library
          versioning information [XXX: should we make this a
          requirement for libraries?].  Since we use libtool, we
          can use its <code>-version-info</code> interface to
          maintain library versions.  This is documented in
          <webref
            url="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC35">section
            `Updating library version information'</webref> of the
          libtool manual, but the explanation is repeated and
          elaborated below.<index>shared libraries!version numbers</index></p>

        <p>The crucial thing to remember is that the versioning
          information encoded in this <code>-version-info</code>
          option is <em>not</em> the component version number, but
          instead an encoding of which <em>interface</em> versions
          a given shared library implements, in the form
          of a triple <code>current:revision:age</code>.
          'Current' is the interface version, as a monotonically
          increasing integer, and 'age' is a statement of how many
          interfaces are compatible with it: if a library has a
          triple <code>c:r:a</code>, then it implements all the
          interfaces between versions <em>c-a</em> and <em>c</em>,
          inclusive.  When you're making a new release of a
          library which had the <code>-version-info c:r:a</code>,
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>If the interface is unchanged, but the
                implementation has changed or been fixed, then
                increment <code>r</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Otherwise, increment <code>c</code> and zero
                <code>r</code>.
                <ol>
                  <li><p>If the interface has grown (that is, the
                      new library is compatible with old code),
                      increment <code>a</code>.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>If the interface has changed in an
                      incompatible way (that is, functions have
                      changed or been removed), then zero
                      <code>a</code>.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

        <p>The libtool documentation suggests starting the
          version-info specifications at 0:0:0, and this is the
          default if no <code>-version-info</code> option is
          present.  Since only some Starlink libraries have this
          versioning maintained, it is best if you start the
          specification at 1:0:0, to distinguish this from those
          libraries which have no version-info defined.</p>

        <p>You add the <code>-version-info</code> specification to
          the libtool command using the library's
          <code>LDFLAGS</code> variable, as follows.  First the
          <code>Makefile.am</code> (from the <code>prm</code> component):
          <index>flags, compiler and linker</index>
<verbatim>
libprm_la_SOURCES = \
    $(F_ROUTINES)
    $(PUBLIC_INCLUDES) \
    $(PRIVATE_INCLUDES) \
    PRM_PAR
libprm_la_LDFLAGS = -version-info $(libprm_la_version_info)

libprm_a_la_SOURCES = \
    $(PLATFORM_C)
libprm_a_la_LDFLAGS = -version-info $(libprm_a_la_version_info)
[...]
</verbatim>
          and then the corresponding section from
          <code>configure.ac</code>:
<verbatim>
AC_INIT(prm, 1.3-1, starlink@jiscmail.ac.uk)
# Version-info specifications.  See SSN/78 for guidelines, and update the table
# below for ANY change of version number.
#
# Release    libprm.la      libprm_a.la
#  1.3-1       1:0:0          1:0:0
AC_SUBST(libprm_la_version_info,   1:0:0)
AC_SUBST(libprm_a_la_version_info, 1:0:0)

[...]
</verbatim>
          There is no automake magic to the
          <code>libprm_la_version_info</code> variable name -- it
          is just mnemonic, and you are free to change it if you
          have a good reason to do so.  Since there is no fixed
          relationship between the component version number and
          the <code>-version-info</code> specification, it is
          important to maintain a simple table of associations
          between the two, and the <code>configure.ac</code> file
          is a sensible place to do that.</p>

          <title>A few remarks on state</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>There is quite a lot of state held within the starconf
          build tree.  This section contains a few notes on where this
          state is, and how to handle it.</p>

        <p>Since most of the details here are rather intricate, you
          might save time by looking at the list of FAQs on state in <ref
            id="state-faqs"/>.</p>

        <p><em>Autotool state</em>: The most obvious state within the
          tree is the existence of the <code>configure</code> and
          <code>Makefile.in</code> files which are the generated by
          autoconf and automake.  Files <code>config.h.in</code> and
          <code>aclocal.m4</code>, are also part of this process,
          inasmuch as they are generated by autoreconf:
          <code>config.h.in</code><index>config.h.in</index> is
          based on the declarations
          within <code>configure.ac</code>;
          <code>aclocal.m4</code><index>aclocal</index> is a
          local cache of m4 macros, drawn from the starconf,
          autoconf, automake
          and libtool installations.  Other objects
          generated by the autotools are the cache directory
          <code>autom4te.cache</code> and the tool links
          <code>config.guess</code>, <code>config.sub</code>,
          <code>depcomp</code>, <code>install-sh</code>,
          <code>ltmain.sh</code>, <code>missing</code> and
          <code>stamp-h1</code>.  All of this can be happily blown away
          by hand, and a lot of it is removed by <kbd>make
            maintainer-clean</kbd><index>make
            targets!maintainer-clean</index>, though this doesn't
          remove things like
          <code>config.h.in</code> which are required for
          <code>./configure</code> to run.  Most of this state is
          maintained reliably by the dependencies within
          <code>Makefile.in</code> -- for example if you update
          <code>Makefile.am</code>, then a simple <kbd>make</kbd> will
          remake <code>Makefile.in</code> and regenerate
          <code>Makefile</code> before using the new
          <code>Makefile</code> to do the build.  If you have removed
          this state or suspect that it may be out of date, then
          autoreconf will always regenerate it -- it's always safe to
          rerun autoreconf.</p>

        <p><em>Configuration state</em>: When <code>./configure</code>
          runs, its most obvious effect is to transform the
          <code>.in</code> files into their corresponding configured
          results.  However at the same time, it creates a log file in
          <code>config.log</code> (which can be handy to examine if a
          configure script fails or appears to give wrong answers), a
          cache in
          <code>config.cache</code><index>config.cache</index> if
          you ran 
          <code>./configure</code> with the <code>-C</code> option, it
          creates the directory-specific <code>./libtool</code> script,
          and it creates a file <code>config.status</code>.  This last
          file holds most of <code>./configure</code>'s state, and can
          be used to either regenerate a particular file
          (<kbd>./config.status Makefile</kbd>) or else to update itself
          (<kbd>./config.status --recheck</kbd> has the effect of
          rerunning <code>./configure</code> with the same options such
          as <code>--prefix</code> which were given to the
          <code>./configure</code> script last time).  You won't often
          have to run
          <code>./config.status</code><index>config.status</index>
          yourself, but it's
          reassuring to know what it's doing when the makefile runs it
          for you.  It is always regenerated afresh by running
          <code>./configure</code>.</p>

        <p><em>Build state</em>: The compiled files are obviously part
          of the build state, and can be removed by <kbd>make
            clean</kbd><index>make targets!clean</index> and
          regenerated with plain <kbd>make</kbd>.  Less
          obviously part of this state are the directory
          <code>.libs</code><index>.libs</index>, which is
          libtool's' workspace and holds
          different types of objects and libraries, and
          <code>.deps</code>, which holds dependency information gleaned
          as part of the last build.  Less obviously still are those
          (few) <code>.in</code> files which are configured as part of
          the build.  As mentioned in <ref id="automakeoverview"/>,
          so-called `installation directory variables' should be
          substituted at make time rather than build time, with a
          hand-written makefile rule in
          <code>Makefile.am</code>.</p>

        <p><em>Starconf state</em><index>starconf!state, lack of</index>: There
          is essentially no starconf 
          state, since the starconf system's only role is to manage
          the <code>bootstrap</code> file and provide the extra
          autoconf macros (installed in the buildsupport part
          of the tree when starconf itself is installed). The
          <code>starconf.status</code> file is purely a cache of
          starconf variables, and allows you to locate the starconf
          installation which was used most recently.  At one time, the
          <code>starconf.status</code> file did hold state, and
          allowed you to manipulate it, and was even checked in; this
          is no longer the case.</p>

        <p><em>Build tree and installation state</em>: The last
          noteworthy state is that in the build tree as a whole.  The
          top-level makefile requires some state in order to manage its
          bootstrapping `make world' build.  This build is organised by
          representing the build and link dependencies between
          components by makefile dependencies between the components'
          installed manifests, which are installed in the
          <code>.../manifests</code><index>manifests!state</index>
          directory alongside, and at the 
          same time, as the component is installed by the
          <code>install</code> Makefile target.  Thus this is state held
          <em>outside of the build tree</em>.  If the `make
          world'<index>make world</index> build 
          sees that a manifest file is up-to-date with respect to the
          dependencies expressed in
          <code>Makefile.dependencies</code><index
            >Makefile.dependencies</index>,
          it makes <em>no attempt to build it</em>, even if the
          component itself has been updated and itself needs rebuilding
          and reinstalling.  A slight wrinkle here is that the
          `buildsupport' tools -- namely starconf and the autotools --
          are not explicitly listed as being a dependency of anything,
          since they are in fact a dependency of everything.  Since they
          are rather a special case, these are built within the
          top-level bootstrap script, and the best way to run that `by
          hand' is via the command <kbd>./bootstrap
            --buildsupport</kbd>, noting that the remarks about
          dependencies above apply to this process also.  Thus, if you
          update a component -- including one of the buildsupport
          components -- and wish the top-level `make world' build to
          notice this, the best way to do this is to first delete that
          component's manifest file from the installation tree.  This
          process might change slightly with starconf developments
          (see <ref id="developments"/>).</p>

        <p><em>CVS state</em>: This isn't really part of the build
          system as such, but this seems a good place to point out, or
          reassure you, that all the state for a CVS checkout
          directory is in the files in the CVS subdirectory, and that
          all the repository state for the directory is in the files
          in the corresponding directory within the repository.</p>

      <subsect id="fortran" export="export" indexkey="Fortran">
        <subhead>
          <title>Preprocessable Fortran</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>The Starlink build system includes support for
          preprocessable Fortran, in both autoconf and automake.</p>

        <p>As described in <ref id="gnutools"/>, the installed version
          of autoconf is extended with support for preprocessable
          Fortran, by adding the two macros <code>AC_PROG_FC</code> and
          <code>AC_PROG_FPP</code>.</p>

        <p>You should use
          <code>AC_PROG_FC</code><index>autoconf!macros!AC_PROG_FC</index> in
          preference to the 
          macro <code>AC_PROG_F77</code> described in the autoconf
          manual, since the `FC' support in autoconf is more flexible
          and more developed than the `F77' support, and the
          older macro is likely to be deprecated in coming autoconf
          releases.  However a potential problem with the
          <code>AC_PROG_FC</code> macro is that it searches for Fortran
          9x compilers before Fortran 77 ones.  Fortran 9x incorporates
          all of <em>strict</em> Fortran 77 as a subset, but no more, so
          if you have used any of the common Fortran extensions (which
          is sometimes unavoidable), you might find the Fortran compiler
          objecting.  In this case, you should use the second optional
          argument to <code>AC_PROG_FC</code> to specify Fortran 77 as
          the required dialect:
<verbatim>
AC_PROG_FC([], 77)
</verbatim>
          See <ref id="macro-ac-prog-fc"/> for full details.</p>

        <p>Unlike C, there is no preprocessor defined as part of the
          Fortran standard, and this is inconvenient if you wish to
          use a Fortran extension if it is available, but not have the
          compilation fail if it is absent.  This most commonly
          applies to the <code>READONLY</code> keyword on the Fortran
          <code>OPEN</code> statement.  It is possible to use the C
          preprocessor, <em>cpp</em>, with Fortran, though not
          completely reliably, since the underlying syntaxes of C and
          Fortran are so different that <em>cpp</em> is capable of
          emitting invalid Fortran in some circumstances.</p>

        <p>Both the Sun and GNU Fortran compilers can handle cpp-style
          preprocessor constructs in a Fortran file, avoiding any
          separate preprocessing stage.  Sun have produced a Fortran
          preprocessor, <em>fpp</em><index>Fortran!fpp (Sun Fortran
          preprocessor)</index>, which is available at 
          <url>http://www.netlib.org/fortran/</url>: it's freely
          available, but not open-source.  And more often than not we
          can in fact fall back on simple <em>cpp</em>, as long as we have
          confined ourselves to the <code>#include</code>,
          <code>#define</code> and <code>#if...</code> constructs.  If
          it comes to that, such simple preprocessing could be mostly
          handled with a simple Perl script.</p>

        <p>Starlink autoconf and automake between them add support for
          preprocessable Fortran.  Autoconf supplies the
          <code>AC_PROG_FPP</code><index>autoconf!macros!AC_PROG_FPP</index> macro
          described in <ref 
            id="macro-ac-prog-fpp"/>, to investigate what compiler and
          preprocessor are available, and automake works with the
          results of that test to add appropriate support to the
          generated <code>Makefile.in</code>.</p>

        <p>For example, you might have in your
          <code>configure.ac</code> file the
          lines<index>autoconf!macros!AC_FC_OPEN_SPECIFIERS</index>
<verbatim>
AC_PROG_FC
AC_PROG_FPP
AC_FC_OPEN_SPECIFIERS(readonly,[access='sequential',recl=1])
</verbatim>
          and have in your <code>my_io.F</code> the lines
<verbatim>
#include &lt;config.h&gt;
      SUBROUTINE MYIO(...)

* blah...

      OPEN ( UNIT = LUCON, FILE = IFCNAM, STATUS = 'OLD',
#ifdef HAVE_FC_OPEN_READONLY
     :       READONLY, 
#endif
#ifdef HAVE_FC_OPEN_ACCESSSEQUENTIALRECL1
     :       ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL',RECL=1,
#endif
     :       FORM = 'UNFORMATTED', IOSTAT = ISTAT )
</verbatim></p>

        <p>The file <code>my_io.F</code> is listed in the
          <code>Makefile.am</code> as one of the <code>_SOURCES</code> of
          whatever library or application it contributes to, alongside
          the other Fortran files.  If the compiler discovered by
          the <code>./configure</code> script can support preprocessor
          statements itself, then the <code>.F</code> file is
          treated like any other; if not, and a separate preprocessing
          stage is required, then the Makefile handles this
          itself.</p>

        <p>Note that we are using <code>.F</code> here as the file
          extension for preprocessable Fortran: see <ref
          id="macro-ac-prog-fpp"/> for discussion.</p>

<p>In those cases where you wish the preprocessing step alone, such as
when you are generating an include file from a template, you
should name the input file with a <code>.F</code> extension
also.  You will need to include a preprocessing rule in the makefile.
The following idiom might be helpful:
<verbatim>
# Run a .F file through the fpp preprocessor, to produce a file with
# no extension.
# The following deals with case-insensitive filesystems, on which
# foo.f and foo.F would be the same file.  FPP_OUTPUT is
# either "" (in which case the preprocessor writes to foo.f, and
# the filesystem is presumably case-sensitive) or ">$@".
foo: foo.F
        rm -f foo
        $(FPP) $(DEFS) $(DEFAULT_INCLUDES) $(INCLUDES) \
           $(FPPFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) foo.F $(FPP_OUTPUT)
        test -f foo || mv foo.f foo
</verbatim>
or the following, for a suffix rule
<verbatim>
SUFFIXES = .F
.F:
        rm -f $@
        $(FPP) $(DEFAULT_INCLUDES) $(FPPFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $&lt; $(FPP_OUTPUT)
        test -f $@ || mv $(&lt;:.F=.f) $@
 </verbatim>
In this second example, in which we have elided the useful comment,
we have declared the <code>.F</code> suffix (we wouldn't have to do
this if there were `real' <code>.F</code> sources in this directory),
and are using the <code>$&lt;</code> and <code>$@</code> magic
variables.</p>

<p>In second example, we elided most of the flag variables we included
in the first one, since we probably don't need them.  In case of
doubt, copy the <code>.F.f:</code> rule in one of the generated
<code>Makefile.in</code> files.</p>

<p>There is a more elaborate example of this in the
<code>prm</code> component.</p>

        <p>The Starlink source code is held in a CVS repository, which

        <p>If you have an account on the repository machine, you have

          making a fresh checkout, or giving other commands not within
          the context of a local check-out, you should refer to it as
<verbatim>
% cvs -d :ext:<em>username</em>@cvs.starlink.ac.uk:/cvs &lt;cvs-command&gt;
</verbatim>
          where <em>username</em> is your username on that
          system<index>CVS!repository</index>; you will need to set
          the environment variable <code>CVS_RSH</code> to
          <code>ssh</code> to connect to the repository.</p>

        <p>There is also anonymous CVS access to the repository.  Use
<verbatim>
% cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.starlink.ac.uk:/cvs login
# password starlink
% cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.starlink.ac.uk:/cvs &lt;cvs-command&gt;
</verbatim>
        There is also anonymous web-based access to the repository at
          <url>http://cvsweb.starlink.ac.uk</url>.  See
          <url>http://dev.starlink.ac.uk/</url> for news.</p>

        <p>There are a few more details about CVS,
          including a link to a CVS Primer, in <ref id="tool-cvs"/>.</p>

        <p>Part of the point of the Starlink CVS repository is to give
          users ready access to the fully up-to-date sources so that
          more sophisticated users can build the most recent
          application versions for themselves and even, if they find a
          bug, offer fixes.  Anyone who finds a bug is invited to
          report it through the Project's bug-reporting system at
          <url>http://dev.starlink.ac.uk/bugzilla/</url>, but if this
          report comes with fixes, it will be <em>particularly</em>
          welcome.</p>

        <p>If you do have bugfixes to offer, then you should get in
          touch with the `owner' of the component to discuss how to
          give them to the project.  You will find the owner of a
          component by looking at the file <code>component.xml</code>
          in the component's checkout directory; this should list
          those who have worked on the component, along with someone
          nominated as the component's `owner'.</p>

        <p>If you make quite a few fixes, then it might be best to
          give you committer access to the repository, by giving you
          an account on the repository machine.  Talk to
          someone from the project about setting that up.</p>

            <title>CVS and tagging</title>
          </subhead>

          <p>Tagging is very important, as it is through tagging that
            you create branches, and mark certain sets of files as a
            set, so that they can be recovered as a set in future.  The
            current tagging policy is at
            <url>http://wiki.starlink.ac.uk/twiki/bin/view/Starlink/CvsTagging</url>.</p>

          <p>You make a tag with the <kbd>cvs tag</kbd> command, while
            you are in a directory with a part of the repository checked
            out:
<verbatim>
cvs tag &lt;tag-name&gt;
</verbatim>
            This applies the tag to the repository versions indicated by
            the files in the current directory.  In the most common
            case, you have just finished preparing the set of files for
            a release, so all the files in the directory are as you want
            them to be, and committed.  There's a slight trap here: if
            there are any files which are <em>not</em> committed, then
            it is the repository version which corresponds to the
            modified file which is tagged, not the
            modified file itself (this is never useful; it is simply a
            warning to use the <code>tag</code> command only in a
            fully-committed directory).  If you tag a set of files which
            are on a branch, then it is (probably unsurprisingly) the
            branched files which are tagged.</p>

          <p>There is also a <kbd>cvs rtag</kbd> command which is
            similar, but operates only on the repository.  You won't
            need to use <code>rtag</code>; don't confuse the two.</p>

            <title>CVS and recursion -- checking out only a subtree</title>
          </subhead>
          
          <p>There are two traps in the way that CVS recurses into
            subdirectories.  The first is that if a subdirectory is
            present in the repository but not in your checkout (most
            commonly because it has been recently added to the repository
            by someone else), then CVS will not by default add that
            subdirectory when you do an update, and will give no
            indication that it is there.  It is not clear to me why this is
            a sensible default, but it is the case nonetheless.  Only if
            the <code>-d</code> option is present on the <kbd>cvs
              update</kbd> command will the `missing' directory
            appear.</p>

          <p>The other `trap' is that CVS does recurse by default when
            you do a checkout.  This is almost always the right thing, but
            it can be inconvenient when you want just the top level of the
            repository.  If you wanted to check out only the top level, or
            only the buildsupport tools, then the command <kbd>cvs -d ??? 
              checkout .</kbd> would not be the right thing, since it would
            check out the top level and everything underneath it.
            A better set of commands would be
<verbatim>
cvs -d username@cvs.starlink.ac.uk:/cvs co -l .
cvs -d username@cvs.starlink.ac.uk:/cvs co buildsupport
cvs -d username@cvs.starlink.ac.uk:/cvs co thirdparty/fsf
</verbatim>
            The first line checks out the top level directory but,
            because of the <code>-l</code> (`local') flag, does
            <em>not</em> recurse and check out the complete repository.
            The following lines check out particular directories,
            usefully recursing into their children.</p>

          <p>If you want to check out just the
            <code>applications</code> directory, but none of its
            children, use
<verbatim>
cvs -d username@cvs.starlink.ac.uk:/cvs co -l applications
</verbatim>
            while in the top-level directory.  Don't do <kbd>... co -l
              .</kbd> in the <code>applications</code> directory --
            you'll get the top-level directory again.</p>

        <title>Building applications and libraries</title>
      </subhead>

      <p>This section applies <em>only</em> to building code which has
        been checked out of the CVS repository.  It does <em>not</em>
        apply to building a distribution tarball: that process is
        nothing more than the usual:
<verbatim>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verbatim>
        with the usual options for the <code>./configure</code>
        script, of which the most important is <code>--prefix</code>
        to control the installation location of the code.  The default
        location is typically <code>/star</code>, though a particular
        distribution might have a different value (see
        <kbd>./configure --help</kbd> for more details).</p>

      <p>Recall that the <kbd>make install</kbd>, above, installs a
        manifest listing the files actually installed, in the directory
        <code>/star/manifests</code> (depending on the value of
        <code>--prefix</code>, which defaults to the value shown by
        <kbd>./starconf.status --show STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</kbd>).</p>

      <p>Most users of this document will likely be concerned only
        with the details of building a particular component, and thus
        concerned primarily with <ref id="buildingcomponents"/>.</p>

      <p>Only rather few users are concerned with building the entire
        tree, for example for the nightly build: this is dealt with in
        <ref id="bootstrapping"/>.</p>

      <p><strong>Note</strong>: In all cases, you should <em>not</em>
        have the <code>INSTALL</code> environment variable defined.
        In old-style Starlink makefiles this indicated the install
        location; in the new-style build system, this location is
        indicated by the `prefix' described above abd elsewhere, and
        the generated Makefiles take the <code>INSTALL</code> variable
        to be the name of a program to use to perform the actual
        installation.</p>

              <p>This target builds the whole tree, in an order which

                <code>ALL_TARGETS</code> within the top-level
                <code>Makefile.in</code>.  Those targets are install
                manifests, in the default manifest directory
                (<code>/local/star/manifests</code> in the example
                below), so that <kbd>make world</kbd> both builds and

                dependencies.  Note that this does nothing if the
                given manifest file is up-to-date with respect to its
                dependencies on other manifest files.  If you have
                just updated a component, then you can rebuild and
                reinstall it by deleting the component's manifest file
                and remaking it.</p>

          <title>Bootstrapping and building the entire tree</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>If you wish to build the entire tree after a fresh
          checkout, you do so at the top level, using the
          <code>./bootstrap</code> script and <code>Makefile.in</code>
          located there.  Neither of these is a `standard' one, as
          installed by <em>starconf</em> or Starlink automake.</p>

        <p>These instructions are echoed in the file
          <code>README</code> in the top-level directory.</p>

        <p>The complete procedure for a full build is as shown

        <p>Line 1: check out the entire collection from the
          repository.  See <ref id="tool-cvs-recursion"/> for hints on
          how to be more discriminating, which may be desirable, since
          not everything in the repository is controlled by this
          bootstrapping build, most notably the contents of the
          <code>java</code> directory.</p>

        <p>Lines 2-4: unset the <code>STARLINK</code> and
          <code>INSTALL</code> variables, and
          set the two starconf variables as
          shown<index>environment variables!STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</index>.
          For a whole-tree
          build, these two should have the same value, to ensure that
          the build uses only tools and libraries which have been
          built at an earlier point in the build.  For fuller details
          of these variables, and more information about controlling
          the bootstrapping process, see <ref
            id="bootstrappingonly"/>.  This example shows sh-style
          commands for manipulating the environment; you will of
          course use the csh-style <code>setenv</code> and
          <code>unsetenv</code> if you're using that shell.</p>

        <p>Also at this point you should review any other environment
          variables that might affect the build.  For example, the
          variables <code>F77</code>, <code>FC</code> and
          <code>CC</code> will force the build system to use the
          specified compilers.  In particular, the default IRAF
          installation sets the <code>F77</code> variable to be a
          script which works happily in most cases, but which will
          _not_ work with libtool, and will cause the build to fail
          with opaque error messages about being `unable to infer
          tagged configuration'.  Unless you do wish to force certain
          compilers to be used, it is probably better to unset these
          variables before building the software.  Try
          <kbd>./configure --help</kbd> for a list of `some
          influential environment variables', and <ref
          id="configure-script"/> for more discussion of this
          issue.</p>

        <p>Line 5: the directory where the components are to be
          installed can be empty, and need not exist at the
          start.  It doesn't matter if this is not empty in fact,
          since most of the installation tree is not examined by the
          build.  The only exception is
          <code>/local/star/manifests</code>, since the files in this
          directory control what is actually built -- see the notes
          for line 9.</p>

        <p>Line 6: put <code>/local/star/bin</code> and
          <code>/local/star/buildsupport/bin</code> in the
          path<index>PATH</index>.
          Make sure that there are <em>no</em> Starlink binary
          directories elsewhere in the path: running <kbd>which
          messgen</kbd> (for example) at this point should find
          nothing.</p>

        <p>Line 7: run the <code>./bootstrap</code> script.  This
          configures, builds and installs the `buildsupport' tools --
          the autotools plus the starconf application -- then
          recursively runs the bootstrap code in a selection of the
          directories beneath this one.  The directories the bootstrap
          recurses into, in this directory and its children, are those
          listed in a <code>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</code> macro in
          <code>configure.ac</code>.  After this, you should be able
          to do
<verbatim>
% which autoconf
/local/star/buildsupport/bin/autoconf
% autoconf --version
autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.59
...
%
          </verbatim>
          to verify that the correct tools have indeed been installed
          in the correct place.</p>

        <p>Line 8: configure the entire tree (the <code>-C</code>
          option indicates that configure should cache its results,
          speeding up the process).  This configures this
          directory and recurses into the children named in
          <code>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</code> in this
          <code>configure.ac</code> and those below it.</p>

        <p>If you will need to give <code>./configure</code> some help
          to find include files and libraries, you <em>might</em> try
          setting the <code>CFLAGS</code> or <code>LDFLAGS</code>
          variables in the environment, in the manner described in
          <ref id="configure-script"/>.  Note, however, that this is
          not a recommended practice.</p>

        <p>Line 9: build the entire tree, using the <kbd>make
            world</kbd> target described in <ref
            id="top-level-makefile"/>.  The make builds all the
          components in an order which ensures that each component is
          build after the components it depends on, as declared in
          <code><ref id="macro-declare-dependencies"
              >STAR_DECLARE_DEPENDENCIES</ref></code>
            <index>dependencies</index> invocations in 
          those components' <code>configure.ac</code> files.  The set
          of dependencies can be examined (if you're interested) in
          the file <code>componentset.xml</code>, which is built up
          from the various directories' <code>component.xml</code>
          files, as reprocessed into
          <code>Makefile.dependencies</code><index
            >Makefile.dependencies</index>.</p>

        <p>Note that the
          dependencies are expressed as dependencies of components'
          <em>manifest</em> files on each other, and the top-level
          makefile is written so that each component is built with the
          pair of commands <code>make; make install</code>,
          which builds the component then installs both it and its manifest.
          Thus, if you need to ask
          for a particular component, foo, to be built, you can do so from
          the top-level directory with <kbd>make
            /local/star/manifests/foo</kbd>.</p>

        <p>Line 10: after the make, a manifest is installed for each
          of the built components.</p>

          <title>Building a single component</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>In <ref id='bootstrapping' /> we saw
          how you would bootstrap and build the entire tree, building
          each component's dependencies before building the component
          itself.</p>

        <p>If, on the other hand, you wish to build only one
          component, because you wish to install the latest and
          greatest version of some application, or because you want to
          work on the CVS version, then you can do that without, in
          principle, building the entire code collection.</p>

        <p>The component directories are organised so that you can
          build a component from a CVS checkout by moving to the
          component's directory and giving the sequence of commands:
<verbatim>
% ./bootstrap
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verbatim>
          Before you can do this, however, you will have to do a
          little preparation, and there are two cases.</p>

        <p>One of the functions of the <code>./bootstrap</code> script
          is to regenerate the <code>./configure</code> script if
          necessary, since it is not checked in to the repository.
          This requires that the Starlink-specific autotools are in
          your path, and so you must first install these
          `buildsupport' tools if they are not installed
          already<index>bootstrapping!buildsupport</index>.
          Instructions for that are <ref id="bootstrappingonly"
          >below</ref>.</p>

        <p>There are two cases next.  The first is where you currently
          have a built and installed Starlink system which you either
          built yourself earlier, or which you installed from a
          Starlink distribution (note: a Starlink CD distribution
          dating before 2005 doesn't count here -- though the
          applications and libraries are essentially the same, the
          distribution and building arrangements changed radically).
          The second case is where you are only interested in one
          component, but are starting from scratch, without a
          pre-existing distribution (of course, once you successfully
          complete the second case, you are in the situation where the
          first case applies).</p>

        <p><strong>Case 1 -- pre-built Starlink system:</strong> This
          is the easy one.  You need check out only the component of
          interest (see <ref id="tool-cvs-recursion"/> for notes on
          that).
          <ul>
            <li><p>Change to the component's directory.</p></li>
            <li><p>Define the environment variable
                <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</code> to point to the top
                of the existing tree, which might be <code>/star</code> or
                its equivalent.</p></li>
            <li><p>Define <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</code> to
                point to the same place if you want to install your new
                versions there, or to a different location if you want to
                install them separately.</p></li>
          </ul>
          At this point you can run <code>./bootstrap</code> as above,
          and have these locations baked in to the configuration as
          the defaults.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you can control these two locations at
          configure time, <em>after</em> you have run
          <code>./bootstrap</code>.  You control the installation
          location with the <code>--prefix</code> option and the
          location of the Starlink tree either with the
          <code>STARLINK</code> environment variable or, better, with
          the <code>--with-starlink</code> option.  Although the use
          of the <code>STARLINK</code> variable is supported, it
          involves less (easily forgettable) defaulting if you use the
          <code>--with-starlink</code> option instead.  See <ref
          id="configure-script"/> for details.  Having said this,
          setting the <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT...</code> variables is
          probably preferable, since you don't then have to remember
          to supply the options if you run <code>./configure</code>
          again.</p>

        <p><strong>Case 2 -- building from scratch:</strong> This
          isn't actually much more complicated, but does take a little
          longer.  You need to check out all of the components that
          your component depends on; since there is (currently) no
          automatic way to discover what this set of components is, in
          practice you might as well check out the whole repository.  Since
          you don't have a pre-built Starlink directory available,
          then you will have to build all or most of the tree, before
          the component you're interested in can be built.  In this
          case, follow the instructions in <ref id="bootstrapping"/>
          -- which include setting the
          <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_...</code> variables to suitable
          values -- but instead of finishing with <kbd>make
          world</kbd> in step 9, do <kbd>make
          /mystar/manifests/cpt</kbd>, where <code>/mystar</code> is
          the location you have chosen for the installation tree (as
          specified in <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</code>), and
          <code>cpt</code> is the component you are interested in.
          This will build and install in turn each of your component's
          dependencies, and then the component itself.</p>

        <p>If you are doing this because you want the latest and
          greatest version of a particular component, then you are
          finished.</p>

        <p>If you are doing this because you want to do development
          work on the component, then you might well want to keep the
          functioning version separate from your development version.
          In this case, you need to go through this procedure once
          with <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</code> and
          <code>..._PREFIX</code> having the same values, as above.
          Next, you change to the component's directory, and either
          bootstrap your development component a second time, with
          <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</code> set to a separate
          installation location (you are now in the situation where
          case 1 applies, above, and you can give the comments
          <kbd>./bootstrap; ./configure; make</kbd>); or else re-run
          <code>./configure</code> with its <code>--prefix</code>
          option set to point to that alternative location (the first
          mechanism simply sets the default for the second, and is
          probably preferable for the reasons mentioned above).</p>

        <p>Note that part of the function of the
          <code>./configure</code> script is to find the location of
          important files and freeze them in to the Makefile.  Thus
          the <code>STARLINK</code> variable is ignored after
          configure-time, so that you cannot, in general, change the
          <code>STARLINK</code> variable or change your path, and have
          new binaries picked up.</p>

          <title>Building monoliths</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>As illustrated in <ref id="automakeoverview"/>, you can
          build monoliths in an analogous way to the way you build
          programs, by declaring the monoliths as the value of the
          <code>bin_MONOLITHS</code> variable.</p>

        <p>Along with the <code>bin_MONOLITHS</code> variable, a
          Makefile must also declare a set of tasks using the
          <code>TASKS</code><index>monoliths!and tasks</index>
          primary, and this set will be empty if the monolith is an
          ATASK.  If a monolith <code>foo</code> has a set of tasks
          <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, then this declaration
          will look like this:
<verbatim>
bin_MONOLITHS = foo
foo_TASKS = a b
</verbatim>
          That is, the tasks are listed without any <code>.ifl</code>
          extension.</p>

        <p>The <code>foo_TASKS</code> primary indicates to automake
          that there will be <code>.ifl</code> files in the local
          directory corresponding to each of the tasks in the
          monolith, that these <code>.ifl</code> files should be
          distributed, and that the appropriate extra links should
          be made, in the binary directory, when the monolith is
          installed<index>symbolic links!to monoliths</index>.
          The tasks variable might also be used in the
          <code>foo_SOURCES</code> variable to declare the
          dependence of the monolith on the Fortran files
          corresponding to the tasks (it would be possible to
          automake to have inferred this last step, but it seems
          clearer overall to have this dependency at least made
          explicit).  Automake permits the usual Makefile variable
          rewritings, so that if you have a Fortran file corresponding
          to each task, then this set is
          <code>$(foo_TASKS:=.f)</code>, which might be useful.</p>

        <p>The generated <code>Makefile.in</code> will install each of
          the task <code>.ifc</code> files, plus the monolith
          <code>.ifc</code> file.  The monolith <code>.ifl</code> file
          is constructed by appending each of the task
          <code>.ifl</code> files, wrapped in <code>begin
          monolith</code> and <code>end monolith</code>, and this
          generated <code>.ifl</code> file should not be included in
          the repository or the distribution.</p>

        <p>If you are building an ATASK<index>ATASKs</index>, then the
          task is the same name as the program.  Indicate this by
          <em>omitting</em> the <code>..._TASKS</code> variable:
<verbatim>
bin_MONOLITHS = foo
# no variable foo_TASKS, since foo is an ATASK
</verbatim>
          (the extra comment is useful to help document the slightly
          non-obvious construction here).  In this case, the only
          <code>.ifl</code> file is that for the ATASK.  The makefile
          makes sure that this <code>.ifl</code> file is distributed,
          so the file should either exist, or have a rule in the
          <code>Makefile.am</code>.</p>

        <p>The <code>MONOLITH</code> primary allows the prefixes
          <code>bin</code>, <code>check</code> and
          <code>noinst</code>, rather like <code>PROGRAMS</code>.</p>
        
        <p>In order to use the monolith support, you must request
          this by including the declaration
          <code>STAR_MONOLITHS</code> in the <code>configure.ac</code>
          file, most rationally near the <code>AC_PROG_CC</code>-style
          declarations.</p>

          <title>Bootstrapping without building: configuring
          starconf and the autotools</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>If you intend to work only on a single component, then you
          can configure and build it as described in <ref
            id="buildingcomponents" >the previous section</ref>.  As
          described there, the bootstrapping procedure requires that the
          `buildsupport' tools -- <em>starconf</em> plus
          Starlink-specific autotools -- be installed and in your
          path.</p>

        <p>You <em>must</em> install the autotools which are part of
          the CVS repository, since these have been extended and
          customised specially for the Starlink build tree (for the
          details of the differences, see <ref id="gnutools"/>).  The
          standard autotools will not work.</p>

        <p>The way to do this is to make sure
          you have the required components checked out (see <ref
            id="tool-cvs-recursion"/>), then go to the
          top of the tree and give the command
<verbatim>
% ./bootstrap --buildsupport
</verbatim>
          This builds and installs the `buildsupport' tools -- namely
          the autotools plus starconf -- but does not go on to
          bootstrap the rest of the tree.  The functions of the
          variables <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</code> and
          <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</code> were described in
          <ref id="starconf"/>: in order to configure starconf at this
          stage, you must define these two variables <em>as environment
            variables</em> before running the <code>./bootstrap</code>
          script.  This will cause the tools to be installed in the
          directory
          <code>$STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX/buildsupport/bin</code>, and
          the configured starconf to configure components, when it is
          itself invoked, so that the default value of
          <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</code> is the value given
          here, as described in the previous section.</p>

        <p>You must use this method of configuring starconf and the
          three autotools -- autoconf, automake and libtool.</p>

        <p>After that, you should put the
          <code>.../buildsupport/bin</code> directory in your path,
          and start work.</p>

        <p>See also <ref id="starconf-default-variables"/> for how to make a
          version of the buildsupport tools which has a default
          installation prefix different from the buildsupport
          installation location.</p>

      <subhead>
        <title>Incorporating a package into the Starlink build system</title>
      </subhead>

      <p>The process of adding a package to the build system, and
        autoconfing it, is reasonably mechanical.  The main
        differences from the traditional build system are as follows.</p>

      <p>There is now no <code>./mk</code> file, and so no platform
        configuration using the <code>$SYSTEM</code> environment
        variable.  Instead, all platform dependencies should be
        discovered by the configuration process.  It is only in
        rather extreme cases that you will need to resort to
        platform-specific code, and that should be handled by
        the starconf macro <ref
          id="macro-platform-sources"><code>STAR_PLATFORM_SOURCES</code></ref>. </p>

      <p>You should try to avoid mentioning or referring to any
        specific platform when configuring.  Test for <em>features</em>,
        working with those you find, and working around those you don't;
        don't test for platforms and believe you can reliably then
        deduce what features are available.</p>

      <p>Traditional Starlink makefiles had two phases, `build' and
        `install' (plus the various export targets).  These makefiles
        often did on-the-fly editing of scripts as they were being
        installed, to edit in version numbers, or the correct path to
        Perl, for example.  There was also implicit configuration done
        in the <code>./mk</code> script, which specified
        platform-specific compiler flags, or versions of `tar'.</p>

      <p>GNU-style projects, on the other hand, have three phases,
        `configure', `build' and `install', and source file editing
        happens only in the first two -- installation consists only of
        the installation of static files.  Most configuration editing
        happens at configure time, when <code>.in</code> files are
        substituted with static information, such as the absolute paths
        to programs, determined as part of configuration.  In the case
        where the substitution involves installation directory
        variables, GNU (and thus general) conventions demand that this
        be done at build time, since these directories involve the
        <code>$(prefix)</code> makefile variable, and it is deemed
        legitimate for the user to specify a different value at build
        time (<kbd>make prefix=xxx</kbd>) from that specified or implied
        at configuration time.  The user may then specify a different
        prefix again at install time (<kbd>make prefix=yyy
          install</kbd>) for the purposes of relocating or staging the
        install, but this must not invalidate the value of
        <code>$(prefix)</code> which may have been compiled into
        applications.  This is discussed in some detail in section
        <webref url="&autoconfhtml;/autoconf_24.html">4.7.2 Installation
          Directory Variables</webref> of the autoconf manual, but you
        generally do not have to worry about it, since it is rather rare
        in practice that you have to compile installation directories
        into the applications and libraries that you build.</p>

      <p>In general, whereas traditional Starlink makefiles quite
        often performed spectacular gymnastics at install time,
        GNU-style makefiles generally do nothing at install time,
        other than occasionally adding extra material to the install
        via one of the installation hooks supplied by automake (see section
        <webref url="&automakehtml;/Install.html" >What gets
          installed</webref> of the automake manual).</p>

      <p>In the traditional build system, the master source was
        regarded as rather private to the developer who `owned' the
        code, who was free to use whatever occult means they desired
        to produce the sources which were put into the three
        distribution objects, `export_source' (just the source),
        `export_run' (just the executable) and `export' (both).  Now,
        everything should be put into the CVS repository, including
        any code-generation tools either as separate packages or as
        local scripts, and it is this source set which is
        used for nightly builds and the like.  If you need tools to
        generate some of the distributed sources, and they cannot be
        included in the package for some reason, they should be
        checked in, and your component should declare a `sourceset'
        dependency on the required tool (see <ref
          id="macro-declare-dependencies"/>).</p>

      <p>With these remarks out of the way, the following is a
        description of the steps involved in bringing first an application
        into the new fold, and then a third-party component.</p>

      <subsect id="autoconfingexample" export="export">
        <subhead>
          <title>Autoconfing a library</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>The example here shows the autoconfing of the adam library,
          chosen simply because it's relatively simple.</p>

        <p>Make a directory to hold the package, and add it to the
          repository
<verbatim>
% pwd
&lt;cvs-checkout&gt;/libraries/pcs
% mkdir adam
% cvs add adam
Directory /cvs/libraries/pcs/adam added to the repository
% cd adam
          </verbatim></p>

        <p>Get the complete set of source files, and check them in to
          the repository.  This means unpacking all the files in
          <code>adam_source.tar</code>, which you can find in
          <code>/star/sources/pcs/adam</code> (as it happens).</p>

        <p>In this case, the <code>adam_source.tar</code> distribution
          tarball is a suitable set of sources.  This is not always
          true, since some Starlink distributions -- especially some of
          the larger libraries and applications -- do quite elaborate
          processing of their sources in the process of creating this
          `source' tarball; in these cases, you should attempt to obtain
          a more fundamental set of sources from the package's developer
          (if that is not you).</p>

        <p>The ideal source for new code is a CVS or RCS repository.
          A CVS repository is easy to import<index>CVS</index> -- you
          just tar it up and
          unpack it into the correct place within the Starlink
          repository.  An RCS repository is barely harder, with the
          only difference being that you have to create the Starlink
          repository directory structure by hand, and copy the RCS
          files into place within it.  The only gotcha with this route
          is that you must make sure that the permissions are correct
          on the resulting repository: you must make sure that
          everyone who should have any access to the repository can
          read <em>and write</em> each of the directories.</p>

        <p>CVS repository access is controlled by groups (at least
          when the repository is shared), and so each directory within
          the repository <em>must</em> have a suitable group ownership, with
          group-write permissions; each directory must also have the
          setgid bit set, so that any directories created within it
          inherit its gid.  Make sure you check this as soon as you
          put the repository in place, or else everyone will have
          problems with the repository.  Within the
          Starlink repository in
          particular, all participants are part of the
          <code>cvs</code> group.  In short, you can set the correct
          permissions on an imported directory <code>foo</code> with
          the commands
<verbatim>
% find foo -type d | xargs chgrp cvs
% find foo -type d | xargs chmod g+sw
</verbatim>
          This sets the group-owner of each directory to be
          <code>cvs</code>, and sets the group-write and set-group-id
          bits in the permissions mask (don't tinker with file
          permissions, since these affect the permissions of the
          checked out files).  You need not worry about file or
          directory ownership, since this always ends up being the
          last person who committed a file.  Note: The instructions
          here are based on observation of CVS repositories; the
          actual requirements don't seem to be formally documented
          anywhere.</p>

        <p>Add <em>all</em> of the source files, including files like
          the <code>mk</code> script and the old <code>makefile</code>,
          which we are about to remove.  Tag this initial import with a
          tag <em>&lt;component&gt;</em><code>-initial-import</code>, so
          that it is possible to recover this old-style distribution if
          necessary.  As mentioned above, it is not
          always completely clear what constitutes the old-style source
          set: so don't do this step mechanically, use your judgement,
          and above all avoid losing information.  Note also that some
          of the infrastructure libraries were added before we settled
          on this particular tagging practice, and so lack such an
          initial tag.</p>

        <p>In this present case, the <code>adam_source.tar</code>
          file includes a Fortran include file containing error codes,
          <code>adam_err</code>; there are two problems with this.</p>

        <p>Firstly, the filename should be uppercase: the file is
          generally specified within the program in uppercase, and it
          should appear thus on the filesystem.  The traditional
          makefile works around this by creating a link from
          <code>adam_err</code> to <code>ADAM_ERR</code>, but this won't
          work (and indeed will fail messily) on a case-insensitive
          filesystem like HFS+, used on OS X.</p>

        <p>The second problem is that this is a generated file, though
          the source is not distributed, is probably misplaced, and in any
          case the generation was probably done on a VAX a decade ago.
          All is not lost, however.  The functionality of the VAX
          `message' utility is duplicated in the application
          <em>messgen</em>, in a component of the same name, along with
          an application <em>cremsg</em> which constructs a source file
          from this message file.  Thus it is neither
          <code>adam_err</code> nor <code>ADAM_ERR</code> which we
          should check in, but the source file <code>adam_err.msg</code>
          which we reconstruct using <em>cremsg</em>.  Thus with error
          files, it is the (probably reconstructed) <code>.msg</code>
          file which should be checked in to the repository, and
          <em>not</em> the <code>_err</code>, <code>_err.h</code> or
          <code>fac_xxx_err</code> files which you may have found in
          the old-style distribution.</p>

        <p>The file <code>adam_defns</code> is similar, but this is
          genuinely a source file, so we need do nothing more elaborate
          than rename it to <code>ADAM_DEFNS</code>, then add it to the
          repository and remove the original lowercased version.  Many
          packages have one or two <code>xxx_par</code> files,
          and these should be similarly renamed to <code>XXX_PAR</code>.
<verbatim>
% tar xf /star/sources/pcs/adam/adam_source.tar
% chmod +x adam_link_adam
% cremsg adam_err
% cvs add *.f mk makefile adam_link_adam adam_defns.h adam_defns adam_err.msg
...
cvs server: scheduling file `adam_err.msg' for addition
cvs server: use 'cvs commit' to add these files permanently
% cvs commit -m "Initial import"
% cvs tag adam-initial-import
% mv adam_defns ADAM_DEFNS
% cvs remove adam_defns
% cvs add ADAM_DEFNS
% rm mk makefile
% cvs remove mk makefile
          </verbatim>
        </p>

        <p>Note that CVS<index>CVS!and file modes</index> preserves
          access modes when it
          stores files, so we should make sure that the script
          <code>adam_link_adam</code> is executable <em>before</em>
          checking it in, and we need not bother to make it executable
          as part of the build process.  On the other hand, scripts
          which are substituted by configure do need to be made
          executable explicitly, which you do by a variant of the
          <code>AC_CONFIG_FILES</code> macro.  The macro invocation
<verbatim>
AC_CONFIG_FILES(foo, [chmod +x foo])
</verbatim>
          substitutes <code>foo</code> from source file
          <code>foo.in</code> and then makes it executable.  Note that
          the sequence
<verbatim>
AC_CONFIG_FILES(foo)
chmod +x foo
</verbatim>
          would <em>not</em> work, since this is one of the cases
          where autoconf macros do not simply expand inline to shell
          code.  For further discussion, see the section <webref
            url="&autoconfhtml;/autoconf_20.html" >Performing
          Configuration Actions</webref> in the autoconf manual.</p>

        <p>Create files <code>configure.ac</code>,
          <code>Makefile.am</code> and <code>component.xml.in</code> by
          copying the templates in the starconf buildsupport directory
          (<kbd>starconf --show buildsupportdata</kbd>); the fields in
          the <code>component.xml.in</code> file are discussed in <ref
            id="componentxml"/>.  If you have an editor that can use it,
          you might also want to create a link to the DTD used for the
          <code>component.xml</code> file, which is in the same
          directory.  Edit these files as appropriate, using information
          in the original Starlink makefile for guidance (so it's
          useful to keep a copy of the original <code>makefile</code> handy,
          rather than simply deleting it as illustrated above).  Then

        <p>What edits should you make?</p>

        <p>The adam <code>Makefile.am</code> file looks as follows:
<verbatim>
bin_SCRIPTS = adam_link_adam
lib_LTLIBRARIES = libadam_adam.la
libadam_adam_la_SOURCES = $(PUBLIC_INCLUDES) $(F_ROUTINES)

</verbatim>
          Four out of six of these variable declarations are variables
          meaningful to automake (see <ref id="automakeoverview"/>),
          and the other two are simply copied from the original
          <code>makefile</code>.</p>

        <p>The adam <code>configure.ac</code> looks like this:
<verbatim>

          <index>CNF</index><index>dependencies</index>
          The first five lines are straightforward boilerplate (see
          <ref id="autoconfoverview"/>).  The next three find a
          Fortran compiler, declare that we want to use libtool to
          build our libraries, and finally that we wish the symbols in
          that library to be of the sort that the CNF package is able
          to handle (see <ref id="macro-cnf-compatible-symbols"/>).
          The `FC' autoconf macros will search for a Fortran compiler
          by looking for a f95 compiler before looking for a f77
          compiler; if you know or discover this is inappropriate,
          then you can constrain the Fortran dialect that
          <code>AC_PROG_FC</code><index>autoconf!macros!AC_PROG_FC</index> will look
          for by giving a value for 
          its optional dialect argument.  Macro
          <code>AC_PROG_FC</code> is not yet documented in the
          autoconf manual, but see <ref id="gnutools"/>.</p>

        <p>After that, we declare the dependencies.  The dependencies
          you work out by any and all means you can.  For a library, the set
          of `build' dependencies is determined by the set of
          components which supply files which the code here includes.
          Grepping for all the Fortran <code>INCLUDE</code> statements
          and all the C <code>#include</code> directives is a good
          start.  For link dependencies, grepping for
          <code>CALL</code> lines is useful for Fortran, and grepping
          for
<verbatim>
= *\([A-Za-z][A-Za-z]*__*[A-Za-z][A-Za-z]*\) *(.*
</verbatim>
will probably be handy.  In fact, the script
<verbatim>
#! /bin/sh -
sed -n \
        -e 's/^ *\(INCLUDE\|include\) *'\(.*\)'.*/_ \2/p' \
        -e 's/^ *\(CALL\|call\) *\([A-Za-z]*_[A-Za-z]*\).*/\2/p' \
        -e 's/.*= *\([A-Za-z][A-Za-z]*__*[A-Za-z][A-Za-z]*\) *(.*/\1/p' \
        ${1+"$@"} | \
    sort | \
    uniq
</verbatim>
          should give you the raw material for most of the
          dependencies you need.  It doesn't really matter too much
          if you get this wrong -- you might cause something to be
          built slightly later than it might be in the top-level
          bootstrap, might cause some eventual user to have to
          download one package more than they have to, or might create
          a circular dependency and break the nightly build, in which
          case you'll find out soon enough.</p>

        <p>See <ref id="macro-declare-dependencies"/> for the
          description of the various types of dependencies you can
          specify here.</p> 

        <p>By the way, remember (because everyone forgets) that there
          are no components <code>err</code> and <code>msg</code>:
          all of the <code>err_</code> and <code>msg_</code> functions
          are in the <code>mers</code> component.</p>

        <p>The next couple of lines tells you that we lied
          outrageously, above, when we were talking about
          <code>.msg</code> files.  Though the remarks there are true
          enough in general, the <code>ADAM_ERR</code> file is special,
          and doesn't come from any <code>.msg</code> file.  This is
          surprising enough that it's worth making a remark to this
          effect in the <code>configure.ac</code> file.</p>

        <p>Finally, we list the files that should be configured.
          Essentially all starconf-style configure files should have
          at least these two files mentioned here.</p>

        <p>Now run starconf.  As described in <ref
            id="starconf"/>, this adds some required files, and
          checks that the directory looks right.  It will look
          something like this:
<verbatim>
% starconf
starconf-validate: the following files are required but do not exist:
        bootstrap
starconf-validate: the following files should be checked in, but aren't
        Makefile.am configure.ac bootstrap component.xml.in component.xml
Configuring with STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK=/export3/sun
Configuring with STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX=/export3/sun
Creating bootstrap
          </verbatim>
        </p>

        <p>That complained that the file bootstrap wasn't present, and
          then went on to install one for you; it listed a number of
          files which should be checked in; and it added a bootstrap
          script.  The starconf application actually does the
          checking by running the <em>starconf-validate</em> script,
          which you can run yourself independently if you wish.</p>

        <p>Now you have a bootstrap file, so run it:
<verbatim>
% ./bootstrap 
starconf-validate: the following files should be checked in, but aren't
        Makefile.am configure.ac bootstrap component.xml.in component.xml
Configuring with STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK=/export3/sun
Configuring with STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX=/export3/sun
File bootstrap already exists, not overwriting
autoreconf --install --symlink
configure.ac: installing `./install-sh'
configure.ac: installing `./missing'
          </verbatim>
          The bootstrap script always re-runs starconf if it can, so
          this reminds you that you still haven't checked those files
          in<index>starconf-validate</index>.  It also runs autoreconf
          (<ref id="autoreconf"/>) for 
          you, installing the helper files that requires, and
          constructing <code>configure</code> from
          <code>configure.ac</code> and <code>Makefile.in</code> from
          <code>configure.ac</code> and <code>Makefile.am</code>.</p>

        <p>Now, finally, you can try <code>./configure</code> and
          <code>make</code>.  That might just work.</p>

        <p>Iterate until success.</p>

        <p>When the code is working, you will might want to add it to the
          set of components which are explicitly built.  To do
          this, add it to the <code>ALL_TARGETS</code> variable in the
          top-level <code>Makefile.in</code>.  Next, go to the parent
          directory of the directory you have just added: the
          <code>configure.ac</code> file there will almost certainly
          have a skeleton <code>configure.ac</code> which includes a
          <code>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</code> line, to which you should add
          your newly working directory.</p>

<subhead>
<title>The build system `interface'</title>
</subhead>

<p>The previous section describes the steps required to bring a
component into the build system.  This section makes reasonably
explicit what was implicit in that previous section, by describing the
`interface' between the build system and a particular component.  The
word `interface' is in scare-quotes there because this interface isn't
formal and isn't enforced, but it should be useful as a check-list and
as an overview.</p>

<p>1. <code>component.xml</code>: every component has to have an
XML-valid instance of this, as defined by
<code>componentinfo.dtd</code> with element
<code>&lt;component&gt;</code> at the root level
(see <ref id='componentxml'/>).</p>

<p>2. A Makefile which implements most/all of the GNU standard
targets<index>make targets</index>.
I think we actually use `all' (default), `install', `check'
and `dist' as part of the build system, and I've mentioned `clean',
`distclean', and `maintainer-clean' elsewhere in this document.  The GNU coding
standards add `uninstall', `install-strip', `mostlyclean', `TAGS',
`info', `dvi', none of which we probably care much about
(uninstalling should probably be handled by whatever
package-management tool we settle on, rather than a makefile).  The
build system does <code>cd xxx; make; make install</code> for
component <code>cpt</code>, where <code>xxx</code> is the contents of
<code>/componentset/component[@id='cpt']/path</code> in the
<code>componentset.xml</code> file.  This requirement comes for free,
given that you use a <code>Makefile.am</code> file and automake, and
this requirement is mentioned only for completeness.</p>

<p>3. Doing `make install' additionally installs a
<code>$prefix/manifests/cpt</code> manifest, which is a valid instance
of the <code>componentinfo.dtd</code> DTD with the
<code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code> element at the root level.  Again, this
step comes for free when you use the automake system.</p>

<p>4. Bootstrapping: the top-level bootstrap script includes a call to
`autoreconf'.  This configures the whole tree, using autoconf's
built-in support for recursing, based around the macro
<code>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</code>, and you should make sure that any new
components are pulled in to this mechanism.  Apart from that,
the behaviour of the <code>./configure</code> scripts isn't really
part of this `interface', except that components are linked in to the
tree-wide configure by virtue of being mentioned in the
<code>configure.ac</code> scripts in their parent (see the `bridging'
scripts in <code>applications/configure.ac</code> and
<code>libraries/configure.ac</code>).  If, for some reason, you wished
to incorporate a large number of components in a new tree (perhaps you
want to include some complicated tree of Perl modules, for example),
then you would similarly hand-write some `bridging' scripts, which
preserve the property that your new tree is configured (doing whatever
is required in a particular situation) when its parent is.</p>

      <subsect id="autodistrib" export="export" indexkey="distribution">
        <subhead>
          <title>Distribution of components</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>The <code>Makefile.in</code> files which automake generates
          generally handles distribution pretty successfully, and the
          command <kbd>make dist</kbd> will usually do almost all the
          work of packing your files into a distribution which can be
          built portably.  In some cases, however, you have to give it
          a little help.</p>

        <p>There are two potential problems.  Firstly, automake may
          not be able to accurately work out the set of files which
          ought to be distributed.  Consider the following makefile
          fragment (this, along with the other examples in this
          section, is from the AST distribution, which presents a
          variety of distribution problems):
<verbatim>
noinst_PROGRAMS = astbad
astbad_SOURCES = astbad.c pointset.h
AST_PAR: ast_par.source astbad
    sed -e 's/&lt;AST__BAD>/'`./astbad | tr 'E' 'D'`'/' ast_par.source >$@
</verbatim>
          Automake packages anything mentioned in a
          <code>_SOURCES</code> variable, so <code>astbad.c</code> and
          <code>pointset.h</code> are included in the distribution
          automatically.  However it does not attempt to work out
          every consequence of the makefile rules, and so fails to
          spot that <code>ast_par.source</code> is going to be needed
          on the build host.  In general, a file which is mentioned
          only in a makefile dependency will not be automatically
          distributed by automake.  Files such as this should be
          included by the distribution by listing them in the value of
          the
          <code>EXTRA_DIST</code><index>distribution!EXTRA_DIST</index>
          variable:
<verbatim>
EXTRA_DIST = ast_par.source
</verbatim></p>

        <p>Automake also supports the <code>dist_</code> and
          <code>nodist_</code> prefixes to automake
          variables<index>distribution!dist prefix</index>.  These
          can be used to adjust automake's defaults for certain
          primaries.  Automake does not distribute
          <code>_SCRIPTS</code> by default (this is since they are
          sometimes generated, but I for one find this
          counter-intuitive), so if you want a script to be
          distributed, you must use a prefix:
<verbatim>
bin_SCRIPTS = ast_link
dist_bin_SCRIPTS = ast_link_adam
noinst_SCRIPTS = ast_cpp
dist_noinst_SCRIPTS = makeh
</verbatim>
          <index>installation!noinst prefix</index>
          We see all four common possibilities here:
          <code>ast_link_adam</code> and <code>makeh</code> are needed
          in the distribution but need no configuration, and so should
          be distributed as they stand; <code>ast_link</code> and
          <code>ast_cpp</code> are configured, so these files should
          not be distributed, since the corresponding <code>.in</code>
          files are (as a result of being mentioned in
          <code>AC_CONFIG_FILES</code>).  Also <code>ast_cpp</code>
          and <code>makeh</code> are used only to build the library,
          and are not installed.  You could get the same effect by
          listing <code>ast_link_adam</code> and <code>makeh</code> in
          <code>EXTRA_DIST</code>, but it is probably a little less
          opaque if all the information about particular files is kept
          in one place.</p>

        <p>Incidentally, the other occasionally important `prefix-prefix' like
          <code>dist</code> is
          <code>nobase</code><index>installation!nobase
            prefix</index>.  See <ref id="nobase-faq"/>.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, files in <code>_SOURCES</code> variables
          are distributed by default, so you must turn this off if one
          of these files is generated at configure time:
<verbatim>
libast_la_SOURCES = \
    $(GRP_C_ROUTINES) \
    $(GRP_C_INCLUDE_FILES) \
    $(GRP_F_INCLUDE_FILES) \
    ast_err.h
nodist_libast_la_SOURCES = \
    ast.h \
    AST_PAR
</verbatim></p>

        <p>Though the set of included files is deterministic, I find
          it is not terribly predictable, and the best way to do this
          sort of tidyup is by making a distribution, trying to build
          it, and thus discovering which files were left out or
          included by accident.  There is no harm in listing a file in
          <code>EXTRA_DIST</code> which would be included
          automatically.</p>

        <p>For fuller detail on automake's distribution calculations,
          see section <webref url="&automakehtml;/Dist.html" >What
          Goes in a Distribution</webref> of the automake manual.</p>

        <p>The second distribution problem is that some Starlink
          components do quite a lot of work at distribution time,
          building documentation or generating sources, generally
          using programs or scripts which are not reasonably available
          on the eventual build host.  This is in principle out of
          scope for automake and autoconf, but since it is common and
          fairly standardised in Starlink applications, Starlink automake
          and autoconf provide some support for pre-distribution
          configuration.</p>

        <p>All configuration tests in <code>configure.ac</code> should
          be done unconditionally, even if they are only meaningful
          prior to a distribution -- they are redundant afterwards,
          but cause no problems.  Any files which should be present
          <em>only</em> prior to the distribution should be listed in
          <code>configure.ac</code> inside macro <ref
            id="macro-predist-sources"
          >STAR_PREDIST_SOURCES</ref><index>starconf!macros!STAR_PREDIST_SOURCES</index>.
          The <code>./configure</code> script expects to find either
          all of these files or none of them, and if it finds some
          other number, it will warn you.  If it finds these files, it
          concludes that you are in a pre-distribution checkout, and
          sets the substitution variable <code>@PREDIST@</code> to be
          empty; if it finds none, it concludes that you are in a
          distributed package, and defines <code>@PREDIST@</code> to
          be the comment character <code>#</code>.  This means that
          makefile fragments which are only usable prior to
          distribution should all be prefixed with the string
          <code>@PREDIST@</code>, and they will thus be enabled or
          disabled as appropriate.  The distribution rules mentioned
          above mean that any configuration of such undistributed
          files must be done by hand in the <code>Makefile.am</code>,
          and not by <code>AC_CONFIG_FILES</code>, since this macro
          automatically distributes the files implied by its
          arguments.</p>

        <p>For example, the AST <code>configure.ac</code> has:
<verbatim>
STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION([sun210 sun211], [sun210.htx_tar sun211.htx_tar])
STAR_PREDIST_SOURCES(sun_master.tex)
STAR_CHECK_PROGS(star2html)
STAR_CHECK_PROGS(prolat, sst)   # prolat is part of SST
</verbatim>
          <index>documentation!complicated</index>
          The <code>sun_master.tex</code> file is used when the
          SUN/210 and SUN/211 files are being generated, and should
          not be distributed.  Since the process of generating the
          documentation uses application <code>star2html</code>, we
          check for this and for <code>prolat</code> (and thus do this
          redundantly even after distribution).  Most components can
          get away with the one-argument version of
          <code>STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION</code> which avoids these
          complications, and does the equivalent of the
          <code>star2html</code> check internally.</p>

        <p>This AST configure script also has
<verbatim>
STAR_PREDIST_SOURCES(error.h.in version.h.in)
</verbatim>
          and carefully avoids calling <code>AC_CONFIG_FILES(error.h
          version.h)</code>.  It still has to configure these files
          prior to distribution, so this has to be done in the
          <code>Makefile.am</code>:
<verbatim>
@PREDIST@predist_subs = sed \
@PREDIST@    -e 's,@star_facilitycode\@,$(star_facilitycode),' \
@PREDIST@    -e 's,@PACKAGE_VERSION\@,$(PACKAGE_VERSION),' \
@PREDIST@    -e 's,@PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR\@,$(PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR),' \
@PREDIST@    -e 's,@PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR\@,$(PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR),' \
@PREDIST@    -e 's,@PACKAGE_VERSION_RELEASE\@,$(PACKAGE_VERSION_RELEASE),' \
@PREDIST@    -e 's,@PERL\@,$(PERL),'
@PREDIST@error.h: error.h.in
@PREDIST@	rm -f $@; $(predist_subs) $&lt; >$@
@PREDIST@version.h: version.h.in
@PREDIST@	rm -f $@; $(predist_subs) $&lt; >$@
</verbatim>
          (this is the same technique that was illustrated in passing
          in the discussion of `installation locations' in <ref
            id="automakeoverview"/>).  The leading
          <code>@PREDIST@</code> strings mean that this stanza causes
          no problems after distribution, when the
          <code>error.h.in</code> files are not present.  See <ref
            id="macro-predist-sources"/> for more details.
        </p>

        <p>This is admittedly a rather crude technique, but it is a
          lot less fragile than the more elegant alternatives.</p>

<title>Making a distribution</title>
</subhead>

<p>In general, the details of making distributions are
outside the (current) scope of this document.  However
there is one aspect we can usefully mention, since it interacts with
the buildsupport tools which configure the distribution.</p>

<p>Normally, when you <code>./bootstrap</code> a directory,
it arranges to install it by default in a location
governed by starconf (see <ref id="starconf"/> for
details).  Since this default is a location on your local
machine, it might not be appropriate for a distribution
tarball.  In that case, you will probably want to ensure
that the built distribution will install into
<code>/star</code> (or <code>/usr/local</code> perhaps).
There are multiple ways you can do this.</p>

<subsubsubsect id="rolldistribution-tree">
<subhead><title>A distribution from the complete tree</title></subhead>

<p>If you are doing this for a complete tree, with the intention of
building all the software and rolling distribution tarballs with the
result, then the procedure you should use is as follows.
<ol>
<li><p>Check out the repository as usual.</p></li>

<li><p>Identify the directory you want to be the default installation
location for the distributed components, and the directory in which
the distributed tarball will find other tools.  These will typically
be the same, but if you are distributing a development or updated
version, you might want the default prefix to be <code>/stardev</code>
but the default Starlink directory to remain <code>/star</code>.  Set
these as the <code>STARCONF_*</code> defaults.
<verbatim>
% export STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX=/star
% export STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK=/star
</verbatim>
If this directory really is just <code>/star</code> then these
settings could in principle be omitted and the variables simply left
unset, since <code>/star</code> is the default for both, but declaring
them explicitly avoids ambiguity.  The directory mentioned here need
not exist or be writable.</p></li>

<li><p>Identify a directory tree to hold the products as you build
them; I'll use <code>/tmp/star</code> as an example.  Since this
directory will receive the the buildsupport tools, and other tools
built during the build, it will need to be included in your PATH.
<verbatim>
% PATH=/tmp/star:$PATH
</verbatim></p></li>

<li><p>Bootstrap the tree, creating as you do so a set of buildsupport
tools which are put in this working tree.  If you do not add this
option then the bootstrap will attempt to install the buildsupport
tools in <code>/star</code>.
<verbatim>
% ./bootstrap --buildsupport-prefix=/tmp/star
</verbatim></p></li>

<li><p>Configure the tree, here overriding the <code>STARCONF_*</code>
defaults.
<verbatim>
% ./configure -C --prefix=/tmp/star --with-starlink=/tmp/star
</verbatim>
This will install the components into <code>/tmp/star</code>, with
later components using tools installed there earlier, but with the
<code>./configure</code> scripts within those components
written so that they will still install in <code>/star</code> by
default.</p></li>

<li><p>Then build the tree as usual.
<verbatim>
% make world
</verbatim>
The manifests will end up in <code>/tmp/star/manifests</code>.</p></li>

</ol>
</p>

<p>After this process has completed, if you go to a built component
and make a tarball using <kbd>make
dist</kbd>, then this tarball will install in <code>/star</code> by
default, which you can check using <kbd>./configure --help</kbd>.</p>

<subhead><title>Distributing a single component</title></subhead>

<p>If, on the other hand, you wish to create a distribution tarball of
a single component, then you do not have to reconfigure the entire
tree to do so (fortunately).</p>

<p>The more robust way is to create a special set of
buildsupport tools which have the desired directory as
their default prefix.  Say you want the distribution to
install by default 
in <code>/star</code>, but have these special buildsupport
tools installed in <code>/local-star/makedist</code> (for
example) .  Do that as follows:
<verbatim>
% STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX=/star ./bootstrap --buildsupport \
    --buildsupport-prefix=/local-star/makedist
</verbatim>
(or use <kbd>env ...</kbd> on csh-type shells; you would
typically specify <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</code> here,
too).<index>bootstrapping!buildsupport</index>.  Setting the two
<code>STARCONF_*</code> variables is actually redundant, here, since
both have <code>/star</code> as their default, but it does no harm and
can make things usefully explicit.</p>

<p>At this point, you can check out the appropriate version
of your software (probably via a CVS export of a
particular tag), put this
<code>/local-star/makedist/bin</code> in your path
(rehashing if you are using csh), and call
<kbd>./bootstrap; ./configure; make dist</kbd> as
usual.  The command <kbd>./configure --help</kbd> will
show you the default prefix for this
<code>./configure</code> script.</p>

<p>An alternative way is to use the
<code>acinclude.m4</code><index>acinclude.m4</index> method described
in <ref id='starconf-default-variables'/>, setting
<code>OVERRIDE_PREFIX</code> to <code>/star</code> (for example).
When you run <code>./bootstrap</code> after that, the given prefix
will be used instead of the prefix baked into the installed
buildsupport tools.</p>

<p>That is, to create a distribution of component
<code>foo</code>, located in <code>libraries/foo</code> in
the repository, you should <em>tag</em> the source set
with a suitable release tag, such as
<code>foo-1-2-3</code>, and then, in a temporary
directory, do the following:
<verbatim>
% cvs -d <em>???</em> export -r foo-1-2-3 libraries/foo
% cd libraries/foo
% echo 'm4_define([OVERRIDE_PREFIX],[/star])' >acinclude.m4
% ./bootstrap
% ./configure
% make dist
</verbatim>
This will leave a tarball such as
<code>foo-1.2-3.tar.gz</code> in the current directory.</p>

          <title>Regression tests</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>Automake provides some simple support for regression tests.
          There is a (terse) description of these in the automake
          manual, in the section <webref
            url="&automakehtml;/Tests.html">Support for test
            suites</webref>, but it lacks any example.  You run the tests
          with <kbd>make check</kbd>, after the build, but before the
          component is installed.</p>

        <p>You can set up tests as follows.
<verbatim>
TESTS = test1 test2
check_PROGRAMS = test1 test2

test1_SOURCES = test1.f
test1_LDADD = libemsf.la libems.la `cnf_link`

test2_SOURCES = test2.c
</verbatim></p>

        <p>The <code>TESTS</code> variable lists a set of programs
          which are run in turn.  Each should be a program which returns
          zero on success, and if all the programs return zero, the test
          is reported as a success overall.  If a non-portable test
          makes no sense on a particular platform, the program should
          return the magic value 77; such a program will not be counted
          as a failure (so it's actually no different from `success',
          and the difference seems rather pointless to me).  A
          <code>PROGRAMS</code> `primary' (see <ref
            id="automakeoverview"/> for this term) indicates that
          these are programs to be built, but the `prefix'
          <code>check</code> indicates that they need be built only at
          `make check' time, and are not to be installed.</p>

        <p>The <code>SOURCES</code> primary is as usual, but while the
          <code>test2</code> program is standalone (it's not clear quite
          how this will test anything, but let that pass), the
          <code>test1</code> program needs to be linked against two
          libraries, presumably part of the build.  We specify these
          with a <code>LDADD</code> primary, but note that we specify
          the two libraries which are actually under test as two
          <em>libtool libraries</em>, with the extension
          <code>.la</code>, rather than using the <code>-lemsf
            -lems `cnf_link`</code> which <code>`ems_link`</code>
          uses as its starting point
          (this example comes from the <code>ems</code> component).
          That tells libtool to use the libraries in this directory,
          rather than any which have been installed.</p>

        <p>The fact that test programs must return non-zero on error
          is problematic, since Fortran has no standardised way of
          controlling the exit code.  Many Fortran compilers will let
          you use the <code>exit</code> intrinsic:
<verbatim>
rval = 1
call exit(rval)
</verbatim>
          to return a status.  Since this is test code, it doesn't
          really matter that this <em>might</em> fail on some
          platforms, but if this worries you, then write the test code
          as a function which returns a non-zero integer value on
          error, and wrap it in a dummy C program:
<verbatim>
test1_SOURCES = test1.f test1_wrap.c
test1_wrap.c:
	echo "int main() { exit (test1_()); }" >test1_wrap.c
</verbatim></p>

        <p>If the tests you add use components other than those
          declared or implied as component dependencies (see <ref
            id="macro-declare-dependencies"/>), then you should
          declare the full set of test dependencies using
          <code>STAR_DECLARE_DEPENDENCIES([test], [...])</code>.</p>

          <title>Importing third-party sources</title>
        </subhead>

        <p><strong>NOTE: this section is subject to a little
            change.</strong>  The guidance in this section is to some
          extent subject to change as we get more experience including
          third-party sources into the tree.</p>

        <p>If an application needs to rely on a non-Starlink
          application, and especially if it relies on a modified
          version, then the sources for that application should be
          checked in to the <code>thirdparty/</code> part of the
          tree.</p>

        <p>There are two stages to this.  Firstly we have to import a
          distribution version of the software, and secondly we have to bring
          it in to the Starlink build system.</p>

        <p>The example here is the GNU m4 distribution, which is
          one of the buildsupport tools necessary on Solaris, which
          has a non-GNU m4 (autoconf relies on language extensions in
          GNU m4, which is therefore required).  The first step is
          rather mechanical, the second better introduced by example.</p>

        <p>First, we get and import the sources (see the fuller
          details in the <webref
            url="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/" >CVS manual</webref>):
          <verbatim>
% cd /tmp
% wget http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.tar.gz
% tar xzf m4-1.4.tar.gz
% cd m4-1.4
% cvs -d :ext:username@cvs.starlink.ac.uk:/cvs import \
    -ko -m "Import of GNU m4 1.4" \
    thirdparty/fsf/m4 FSF m4-1-4
</verbatim></p>

        <p>The <code>-ko</code> option turns off any keyword expansion
          for the newly-imported files.  Thus they will retain the
          values they had when they were imported.  This appears to be
          the practice recommended by the CVS manual, though it is not
          absolutely clear that it is best, and this should not be
          taken as a firm recommendation.</p>

        <p>The <code>thirdparty/fsf/m4</code> argument is the location
          of the new component within <em>our</em> repository, the
          path to which will be created for you if necessary.  FSF --
          the `Free Software Foundation' -- is the `vendor' in this
          case, and this is used for the location within the
          <code>thirdparty/</code> tree as well as the next CVS
          argument.  CVS uses this vendor argument as the name of the
          branch this new import is nominally located on.</p>

        <p>Finally, this import command tags the imported files with
          the tag you give as the last argument.  This should use the
          same convention as other tags within the Starlink
          repository, namely the component name and version
          number.</p>

        <p>Note that we import a <em>distribution tarball</em> of the
          source, namely one including the <code>configure</code>
          script and any other generated files.  This is because we
          cannot reliably bootstrap the original sources if they, for
          example, and also so that we can reliably track any future
          releases of the tarball.  Even if the component has a public
          CVS archive, resist the temptation to import a snapshot of
          that.</p>

        <p>Now that the source set is in the repository, you can go
          back to your checkout tree and check the new component out:
          <verbatim>
% cd &lt;checkout-tree&gt;
% cvs -d :ext:username@cvs.starlink.ac.uk:/cvs co thirdparty/fsf/m4

          We see that the newly-imported files have been put on the
          1.1.1 branch, named <code>FSF</code>.  Any files we add to
          this component, and any files we modify, will go on the
          trunk.</p>

        <p>What you do next depends on how easy it is to configure the
          new component.  We'll look at three examples,
          the <code>m4</code> component, containing the GNU version of m4,
          the <code>cfitsio</code> component, containing the HEASARC
          FITS library, and
          the <code>tclsys</code> component, containing a distribution
          of Tcl.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>The <code>m4</code> configuration is quite regular
                (as befits a core GNU component), and so admits of
                reasonable adaptation in place, by simply editing the
                configuration files included in the distribution (and
                then, despite what we said above, regenerating the
                distributed <code>./configure</code> script.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The <code>cfitsio</code> distribution comes with its
                own configure scripts, but they are generated using a
                rather old version of autoconf, so we want to avoid
                touching them.  However the build is basically rather
                simple, and only a few built files need to be
                installed.  This component shows how to wrap a
                distribution's own configuration in a straightforward
                way.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The <code>tclsys</code> component, on the other hand
                comes with its own fearsomely intricate configuration
                and installation mechanism, which we want to disturb
                (or indeed know about) as little as possible.  This
                section shows how to wrap such an installation in the
                most general way.</p>
            </li>

        <subsubsect indexkey="components!m4">
          <subhead>
            <title>Configuring m4</title>
          </subhead>

          <p>The first thing to do is to add the
            <code>component.xml.in</code> file:
<verbatim>
% cp `starconf --show buildsupportdata`/template-component.xml.in \
      component.xml.in
</verbatim>
            after which we edit <code>component.xml.in</code>
            appropriately.  This editing turns out to be slightly more
            intricate than usual: the <code>configure.in</code> file is
            old-fashioned enough that it does not define the
            substitution variables that <code>component.xml.in</code> is
            expecting, and it requires a slightly closer inspection of
            <code>configure.in</code> to determine what these should be
            (<code>@PRODUCT@</code> and <code>@VERSION@</code> in this
            case).  Although this step seems redundant, it is best to
            have this file configured rather than completely static, so
            that the generated <code>component.xml</code> will remain
            correct when and if a new version of the `m4' component were
            imported.  Having said that, ensure that the
            <code>&lt;bugreports&gt;</code> element in the
            <code>component.xml.in</code> file points to a Starlink
            address -- we don't want bugs in <em>our</em> modifications
            to be reported to the original maintainers.</p>

          <p>Note that it is the now-deprecated
            <code>configure.in</code> file that is the autoconf source
            in this component, and that it has now-deprecated syntax;
            there is no need to update this.  When we run autoreconf, we
            discover that this is not the only obsolete feature, and we
            have to do some futher mild editing of
            <code>configure.in</code> before it is acceptable to the
            repository version of autoconf, though it still produces a
            good number of warnings.  These don't matter for our present
            purposes: the <code>./configure</code> which autoreconf
            produces (and which we commit) still works, and the
            component builds and runs successfully.  If the
            <code>configure.in</code> were old enough that our current
            autoconf could not process it at all, then we might consider
            retrieving and temporarily installing an older version of
            autoconf -- the <code>./configure</code> script includes at
            the top a note of the autoconf version which produced
            it.<index>autoconf!old versions</index></p>

          <p>In order for the new component to be a good citizen in the
            Starlink build tree, it needs to install a file manifest as
            part of the <code>install</code> target<index>manifests!and
              third-party code</index>.
            Add to the <code>configure.in</code> file the lines
<verbatim>
: ${STAR_MANIFEST_DIR='$(prefix)/manifests'}
AC_SUBST(STAR_MANIFEST_DIR)
</verbatim>
            If we were using Starlink automake, this would be enough to
            prompt it to include support for installing a manifest in the
            <code>Makefile.in</code> it generates.  The GNU m4
            distribution does not, however, use automake, so we need to
            add this by hand.  The following additions to
            <code>Makefile.in</code> do the right thing, though they are
            rather clumsier than the support that Starlink automake adds:
<verbatim>
STAR_MANIFEST_DIR = @STAR_MANIFEST_DIR@

         for subdir in $(SUBDIRS); do \

        rm -Rf STAGING
</verbatim>
            (if you look at <code>thirdparty/fsf/m4/Makefile.in</code>
            you will see that we actually need to have <code>PRODUCT</code> and
            <code>VERSION</code> there instead of the more general
            <code>PACKAGE_NAME</code> and <code>PACKAGE_VERSION</code>
            above).  Note that the actual installation happens within
            the rule for <code>install-manifest.xml</code> -- this
            guarantees that the <code>$(prefix)</code> stored in the
            manifest is the same as the <code>$(prefix)</code> actually
            used for the installation.</p>

          <p>Since we are creating this manifest entirely by hand, we
            are responsible for ensuring that the resulting file
            conforms to the DTD in <code>componentinfo.dtd</code> (in
            the starconf <code>buildsupportdata</code> directory).</p>

          <p>We add the <code>component.xml.in</code> file to the
            repository, and look at what we have.
<verbatim>
% cvs add component.xml.in
% cvs -n update
</verbatim>
            This tells us that <code>configure</code>,
            <code>configure.in</code> and <code>config.h.in</code> have
            been modified, and <code>component.xml.in</code> added, but
            we also discover that files <code>stamp-h.in</code>,
            <code>doc/stamp-vti</code> and <code>doc/version.texi</code>
            have also been modified, as part of the regeneration of the
            <code>./configure</code> script.  The modification to the
            stamp file <code>stamp-h.in</code> we should probably
            commit, to avoid dependency niggles in the future, but the
            meaningless changes to the two <code>doc/</code> files we
            can just discard:
<verbatim>
% cvs commit -m "Add component.xml template" component.xml.in 
% cvs commit -m "...blah..." configure configure.in config.h.in 
% cvs commit -m "Stamp file regenerated by autoreconf" stamp-h.in
% rm doc/stamp-vti doc/version.texi 
% cvs update doc
</verbatim></p>

          <p>We can see that the changes to <code>configure.in</code>
            are now on the trunk for this component, rather than the
            FSF branch.

            library of the same name, and installs from it the library
            itself, plus a few header files.  Although we probably
            could adapt the library's distributed autoconf script,
            that script is sufficiently old, and there are
            sufficiently few components installed, that it is less
            trouble to simply wrap this configuration in another
            one.</p>

          <p>The <code>cfitsio</code> component contains a
            <code>cfitsio/</code> directory containing the distributed
            library source.  Along with it are the usual
            <code>component.xml.in</code> file, copied from the
            template in <code>`starconf --show
            buildsupportdata`</code>, and <code>Makefile.am</code> and
            <code>configure.ac</code> files, which are too different
            from the template ones for them to be helpful.</p>

          <p>The <code>configure.ac</code> looks like this:

            Note that we must use <code>STAR_DEFAULTS</code>, and we
            must not use <code>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</code>, for the reason
            described in the comments above, even though configuring
            the subdirectories is exactly what we want to do. This
            particular combination of commands is sufficient to
            configure the <code>cfitsio</code> distribution -- you might
            need to do different things for other third-party
            packages.  That's all the configuration we need; how about
            the Makefile?</p>

          <p>The <code>Makefile.am</code> looks like this:
<verbatim>
## Process this file with automake to produce Makefile.in

dist_bin_SCRIPTS = cfitsio_link

lib_LIBRARIES = cfitsio/libcfitsio.a
# There are no sources for libcfits in this directory.

# and adds its own, conflicting, target.

	(cd cfitsio; unset CFLAGS; $(MAKE))

...
</verbatim>
            (if you look in the <code>cfitsio</code> component, you will
            see that the actual <code>Makefile.am</code> does a little
            more than this, and is rather more copiously commented,
            but these are the important parts).</p>

          <p>This uses a number of useful automake features.  First of
            all, the assignments which control what is installed --
            the contents of the <code>_LIBRARIES</code>,
            <code>_HEADERS</code> and (via
            <code>EXAMPLE_SOURCES</code>) <code>_DATA</code> primaries
            -- refer to files within the <code>cfitsio/</code>
            subdirectory.  When these are installed, the path to them
            is stripped, so that <code>libcfitsio.a</code>, for
            example, ends up installed in <code>.../lib/</code> and not
            in <code>.../lib/cfitsio/</code>, as you might possibly
            intuit.  This is the useful behaviour which is turned off
            by the use of the <code>nobase_</code>
            prefix<index>installation!nobase prefix</index>, as
            described in <ref id="nobase-faq"/>.</p>

          <p>Second, the presence of the <code>lib_LIBRARIES</code>
            line means that automake expects to find some library
            sources somewhere, and if it is not told where they are
            with a <code>xxx_SOURCES</code> variable, then it will
            assume a default based on the library name.  In this case,
            of course, the sources are not in this directory, and we
            do not wish automake to generate rules to build them, so
            we have to pacify it by giving a value for the
            <code>cfitsio_libcfitsio_a_SOURCES</code> variable (note
            the canonicalisation of the library name).</p>

          <p>Each of the
            <code>cfitsio/</code> targets is built in the same way, by
            switching to the <code>cfitsio/</code> directory and
            making `all' using that directory's own Makefile.  The
            only remaining wrinkle is that it turns out we have to
            specify the <code>cfitsio/libcfitsio.a</code> target by
            itself, rather than as part of the previous compendium
            target.  Due, probably, to a bug, automake does not appear
            to `notice' the library if it's mentioned in the
            compendium target, and instead generates its own
            conflicting target.</p>

            <title>Configuring tcl</title>

          <!-- NB: section macro-special-install-command refers to
               this section as an example. -->

          <p>The <code>tcl</code> component (like the parallel
            <code>tk</code> component) is paradoxically easy to
            configure, partly because its distributed
            <code>./configure</code> script is generated by a version
            of autoconf too old for us to handle directly, which means
            that we want to avoid touching it as much as possible, but
            also because the Tcl distribution has an installation
            mechanism which is too complicated to be handled by the
            simple scheme in the previous <code>cfitsio</code>
            section.  The method we use instead, as described below,
            actually looks simpler, but you should probably not resort
            to it unless necessary, since the starconf macro is uses
            -- <ref id="macro-special-install-command"
              ><code>STAR_SPECIAL_INSTALL_COMMAND</code></ref> -- is a
            dangerously blunt instrument.</p>

          <p>After being unpacked and imported as described above, the
            top-level of the checked out Tcl distribution looks like this:
<verbatim>
ptolemy:tcl> ls
CVS/       README   compat/  generic/  license.terms  tests/  unix/
ChangeLog  changes  doc/     library/  mac/           tools/  win/
</verbatim>
            The way that the distributed <code>README</code> tells us
            to compile Tcl is to change to the <code>unix/</code>
            subdirectory, and type <code>./configure; make</code>.  We
            want to create files <code>Makefile.am</code> and
            <code>configure.ac</code> in this directory, which handle
            this for us.</p>

          <p>We add a <code>component.xml.in</code> as before, plus
            non-standard <code>configure.ac</code> and
            <code>Makefile.am</code> files.  The
            <code>configure.ac</code> should look like this:

          <p>This looks rather like the
            <ref id="config-cfitsio"><code>cfitsio</code> example</ref>,
            except for the addition of the new macro, which uses a
            parameterised version of the distribution's own install
            command to make the installation into the Starlink tree.</p>

          <p>As described in <ref id="macro-special-install-command"/>,
            <index>starconf!macros!STAR_SPECIAL_INSTALL_COMMAND</index> this adapts
            the standard Makefile <code>install</code> target so that
            it uses the given command to make an installation.  Note
            that the version of autoconf which generated the Tcl
            <code>Makefile.in</code> template was one which used the
            <code>INSTALL_ROOT</code> variable instead of the
            <code>DESTDIR</code> variable used by more modern
            versions, and so we have to adjust this in this command
            line.  This <code>DESTDIR</code> variable is important, as
            it is used during the installation of the component, to do
            a staged installation, from which a manifest can be
            derived.</p>

          <p>This staging step is important, and is rather easy to get
            wrong.  If you do get it wrong, then the installed
            manifest will be wrong, probably causing problems later
            when it comes to deinstalling or packaging this component.
            The role of the <code>INSTALL_ROOT</code> variable above
            was discovered only by inspecting the
            <code>Makefile.in</code> in the Tcl distribution: if there
            were no such facility, we could (probably) fake much of it
            by using something like <code>$(MAKE)
            prefix=$$DESTDIR$$prefix install</code> in the
            installation macro.  The distributed Tcl Makefile appears
            to respect the variable, but it is important to check for
            errors such as making absolute links<index>symbolic
            links!absolute links are bad</index>, or using the current
            directory incautiously (search for <code>LN_S</code> or
            <code>`pwd`</code> in the <code>Makefile.in</code>).</p>

          <p>The <code>Makefile.am</code> file is even simpler:
<verbatim>
## Process this file with automake to produce Makefile.in

@SET_MAKE@
RECURSIVE_TARGETS = all clean

default: all

$(RECURSIVE_TARGETS):
        cd unix; $(MAKE) $@
</verbatim>
</p>

          <p>After writing the <code>Makefile.am</code> and
            <code>configure.ac</code> files, all you need to do is run
            starconf to create a <code>./bootstrap</code> file, and
            check in the files which starconf suggests.</p>

          <p>That's it!</p>

        <p>
          When importing third-party code that includes pre-created
          <code>configure</code> scripts, <code>Makefile.in</code> etc., 
          that you do not want to re-generate automatically, because they have
          inconsistent timestamps -- that is say a Makefile.in file is older
          than an associated Makefile.am, because the initial import
          was in the wrong order or too quick (file systems typically resolve
          at one second intervals), then you may need to re-establish the
          time ordering of some files, but only if the imported build
          system is sensitive to these changes. The way to do this is
          by creating a file <code>bootstrap_timeorder</code> that
          contains a list of relative file names (to the directory 
          containing the <code>bootstrap</code> script), in the order
          from oldest to newest. Look for an example of one of these
          files in the source tree.

        <subhead>
          <title>Documentation</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>There is fairly complete support for documentation within
          the build system.  Most Starlink documentation is in the
          form of &latex; files respecting certain conventions (see
          <docxref doc="SGP/28">SGP/28: Writing Starlink
            documents</docxref> and <docxref doc="SUN/199" >SUN/199:
          Star2HTML</docxref> for some further details), but a small
          amount is in a custom XML DTD, converted using the kit contained in
          the <code>sgmlkit</code> component, documented in <docxref
            doc="SSN/70" />.</p>

        <p>The simplest case is where you have one or more
          <code>.tex</code> files in the component directory (that is,
          the directory which contains the <code>component.xml</code>
          file).  In this case, you simply declare the document
          numbers, and the files named after them, in a
          <code>STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION</code> macro, as in:
<verbatim>
STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION([sun123 sc99])
</verbatim>
          This will put these document codes into the substitution
          variable <code>@STAR_DOCUMENTATION@</code>, which you can
          use to substitute in <code>component.xml.in</code>, and it
          will arrange to compile the &latex; files
          <code>sun123.tex</code> and <code>sc99.tex</code>.  This
          macro is documented fully in <ref
          id="macro-latex-documentation" />.</p>

        <p>The final step in this case is to declare that the
          documentation is to be built and installed in the Starlink
          documentation directory.  You do that by including the
          following line in the component's <code>Makefile.am</code>:
<verbatim>
stardocs_DATA = @STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION@
</verbatim>
          (see <ref id="variable-starxxxdata" />).  This substitution
          variable expands to the default list of documentation
          targets (at present comprising <code>.tex</code>,
          <code>.ps</code> and <code>.htx_tar</code>, but subject to
          change in principle).</p>

<p>The next simplest case is where the source files are in a different
directory from the <code>component.xml</code>.  Indicate this by
appending a slash to the end of each of the document codes located
elsewhere.  For example:
<verbatim>
STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION([sun123/ sc99])
</verbatim>
This will behave as above for the <code>sc99.tex</code> file, but
differently for the <code>sun123</code> document.  That code,
<code>sun123</code> is still included in
<code>@STAR_DOCUMENTATION@</code>, but it is the variable
<code>@STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION_SUN123@</code> which is set to the
default target list, and not <code>@STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION@</code>.
Documentation specified in this way does <em>not</em> -- contrary to
appearances -- have to live in a similarly named subdirectory of the
component directory; instead you will have to separately make sure that the
documentation is built at build time.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, you are managing the documentation for
the package which contains SUN/123, and suppose the source for this is
in a subdirectory <code>docs/sun-cxxiii</code> (whimsy is a terrible
thing), then you would still refer to the documentation via
<code>STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION(sun123/)</code> as above, but in the
file <code>docs/sun-cxxiii/Makefile.am</code> you would include at
least the line
<verbatim>
stardocs_DATA = @STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION_SUN123@
</verbatim>
and make sure that directory <code>docs/sun-cxxiii</code> is built,
and its contents installed when appropriate, by the usual method of
mentioning the directory in a <code>SUBDIRS</code> declaration in the
component <code>Makefile.am</code>:
<verbatim>
SUBDIRS = docs/sun-cxxiii
</verbatim>
The <code>datacube</code> component uses this mechanism to build its
documentation.</p>

<p>If you need to add extra files to the <code>.htx</code> tarball,
you can do so via the <code>.extras</code> file described in <ref
id="macro-latex-documentation"/>.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you need to do more elaborate things to build
          your documentation -- the <code>ast</code> component is a
          good example, here.  In this case, you can give a non-null
          second argument to the <code>STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION</code>
          macro, giving a list of makefile targets which should be
          built.  The document codes in the first argument are still
          included in <code>@STAR_DOCUMENTATION@</code>, but the
          second argument is included verbatim in
          <code>@STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION@</code> without any
          defaulting.  You are responsible for adding the given
          targets to the Makefile and, as before, you should add
          <code>@STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION@</code> to the
          <code>stardocs_DATA</code> Makefile variable.</p>

        <p>If you have produced XML documentation, use the
          <ref id="macro-xml-documentation"
          ><code>STAR_XML_DOCUMENTATION</code></ref> macro, which is
          closely analogous to the &latex; one.</p>

<subsubsect indexkey="documentation!docs-only components">
<subhead>
<title>Components containing only documentation</title>
</subhead>

<p>Though most applications and libraries have some documentation
associated with them, some documentation is not associated with any
particular software, and so lives in a component by itself.  These
components are principally the various cookbooks and system notes,
though there are a few SUNs in this category as well.  Though the
correct way to handle such components should be fairly clear from the
discussion above, it seems worth while to make a few remarks here to
clear up some ambiguities.</p>

<p>Like any other component, a documentation-only component must have
a bootstrap file, and <code>Makefile.am</code>,
<code>configure.ac</code> and <code>component.xml.in</code> files, as
described in <ref id="autoconfingexample"/>; however these will
typically be rather simple.</p>

<p>We can look at the SC/3 configuration files for an example.</p>

<p>The <code>configure.ac</code> file, shorn of most of its comments,
looks like this:
<verbatim>
dnl    Process this file with autoconf to produce a configure script
AC_INIT(sc3, 2, starlink@jiscmail.ac.uk)
AC_PREREQ(2.50)
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(1.8.2-starlink)
AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR(sc3.tex)

STAR_DEFAULTS(docs-only)

STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION(sc3)

AC_CONFIG_FILES(Makefile component.xml)

AC_OUTPUT
</verbatim>
Note the <code>docs-only</code> option to the
<code>STAR_DEFAULTS</code> macro (see <ref id="macro-defaults"/> for
discussion).  This particular <code>configure.ac</code> file is to
handle document SC/3.2 -- this second edition of the document is
represented by the <code>AC_INIT</code> macro having a `version'
number of `2'.</p>

<p>The <code>Makefile.am</code> file has some mild complications:
<verbatim>
## Process this file with automake to produce Makefile.in

stardocs_DATA = @STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION@
starexamples_DATA = $(distdir)-scripts.tar

sc3.htx_tar: sc3-scripts.tex

# sc3-scripts.tex is an appendix to the HTML version of the document,
# comprising the scripts contained in the scripts/ directory.  These are
# also bundled in the htx tarball by virtue of being listed in the
# sc3.htx_tar.extras file.
sc3-scripts.tex: scripts
	cd scripts; \
	for f in *; do if test -f $$f; then \
	    echo $$f | sed 's/\([a-z0-9_]*\).*/\\subsection{\\label{se_\1_source}\\xlabel{\1}\1}/'; \
	    echo "\htmladdnormallink{Download $$f}{$$f}"; \
	    echo ''; \
	    echo '\begin{verbatim}'; \
	    cat $$f; \
	    echo '\end{verbatim}'; \
	fi; done > ../$@

$(distdir)-scripts.tar: scripts
	DN=$(distdir)-scripts; \
	    mkdir $$DN; \
	    for f in scripts/*; do if test -f $$f; then cp $$f $$DN; fi; done;\
	    tar cf $@ $$DN; \
	    rm -Rf $$DN
</verbatim>
This is the complete SC/3 file.  The only thing that is always
required in these docs-only <code>Makefile.am</code> files is the
<code>stardocs_DATA = @STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION@</code> line, which
has exactly the same function described in <ref
id="autoconfing-docs"/> above.  However cookbooks like SC/3 often have
both sets of examples (in this case, example scripts) and some
automatically generated documentation, and this example illustrates
how to describe both of these.  The <code>starexamples_DATA</code>
line specifies a file which is to be installed in the examples
directory (typically <code>/star/examples</code>; see <ref
id="variable-starxxxdata"/>), and the <code>Makefile.am</code>
therefore provides the rule for generating that tarball of
scripts.</p>

<p>In addition, the <code>sc3.tex</code> file includes (in the &tex;
sense) a generated file <code>sc3-scripts.tex</code>, which documents
these various scripts, and so we include in this
<code>Makefile.am</code> the rule for generating this file from the
contents of the <code>scripts/</code> directory.  We must also
indicate that the <code>sc3.htx_tar</code> file depends on this
generated file, and we do this by including that dependency (without
the build rule, which is generated automatically) in this
<code>Makefile.am</code> file.</p>

<p>Finally, note that this SC/3 directory uses the
<code>.htx_tar.extras</code> mechanism which is described rather in
passing in <ref id="macro-latex-documentation"/>.</p>

          <title>Adding components: the final step</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>Whichever type of component you have added, the final step,
          after committing your changes, is to ensure that your new
          component and its
          newly-declared dependencies are integrated into the network
          of dependencies contained within the
          <code>Makefile.dependencies</code><index
            >Makefile.dependencies</index><index
            >dependencies!updating</index><index
            seealso="Makefile.dependencies"
            >dependencies!updating</index>
          file at the top level.  To do this, you must go to the top
          level of a <em>full checkout</em> of the repository, make
          sure your new component is checked out there, then delete
          <code>Makefile.dependencies</code> and remake it.
          <verbatim>
% rm Makefile.dependencies
% make Makefile.dependencies
# ... remakes componentset.xml, and from that Makefile.dependencies
% cvs -n update
M componentset.xml
M Makefile.dependencies
</verbatim>
          The <code>Makefile.dependencies</code> file is generated
          using a Java program, so you must have a JDK in your
          path before starting this procedure
          (you might possibly need to run <kbd>./configure
          --no-recursion</kbd> to bring the <code>Makefile</code>
          there up to date with respect to <code>Makefile.in</code>).
          Alternatively, you can invoke make with
          <kbd>make JAVA=/path/to/jdk Makefile.dependencies</kbd>.</p>

        <p>Double-check both <code>Makefile.dependencies</code> and
          <code>componentset.xml</code>, using <kbd>cvs diff
          &lt;file&gt;</kbd>: ensure that the right material has
          been added before re-committing these two files.  If this
          diffing appears to indicate that material has been
          <em>removed</em> from either file, this probably means that
          you don't have a full or up-to-date checkout, so investigate
          that and fix things up before committing.</p>

        <p>If the component you have added should be included in the
          `make world' build, then you should add it to the list of
          targets listed in the <code>ALL_TARGETS</code> variable at
          the top of the top-level <code>Makefile.in</code>.  You
          should do this only if both this component <em>and anything
          it depends upon</em> build successfully from scratch.</p>

        <p>For FAQs specifically about installation, see <ref
            id="install-faqs">the next section</ref>, and for quite
            detailed FAQs about the various ways that state is held in
          the starconf system, see <ref id="state-faqs"/>.</p>

        <p>In the examples below, the installation location
          (that is, <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</code>) is written as
          <code>/local-star</code>, and the example component is usually
          <code>cpt</code>.</p>

        <p><dl>
            <dt>How do I control which compiler and compiler options I
              use?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>You can control the compiler at configure time by
              specifying the variable <code>F77</code>,
              <code>FC</code>, <code>CC</code> or <code>CXX</code>, as
              appropriate<index>environment variables</index>; and you
              add compiler options with the 
              <code>FFLAGS</code>, <code>FCFLAGS</code> or
                <code>CFLAGS</code> variables.  For details and
              warnings, see <ref id="configure-script"/>.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>I've just been told ``<code>make: *** No rule to make
                target `/local-star/manifests/cpt', needed by
                `world'.  Stop.</code>  What's wrong?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>The component <code>cpt</code> has been referred to
                in a dependency, but the
                <code>Makefile.dependencies</code><index
                  >Makefile.dependencies</index> file has no knowledge
                of it.  Whoever added the <code>cpt</code> component
                forgot to do the final step mentioned in <ref
                  id="autoconfing-final"/>, so you should do that now.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Why does <kbd>make world</kbd> not do
              anything?<index>make world</index></dt> 
            <dd>
              <p>The <kbd>make world</kbd> build works by comparing
                timestamps of the <em>installed</em> files in the
                manifests directory -- that is, in something like
                <code>/local-star/manifests</code>, outside of the build
                tree.  It only checks whether each component was
                <em>installed</em> after each of the components it
                depends on.  If you wish to use this to (rebuild and)
                reinstall a given component, then simply delete the
                manifest file for the component in question and re-run
                <kbd>make world</kbd>.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, <kbd>make</kbd> in the top-level
                checkout directory will recurse, and invoke <kbd>make
                  all</kbd> in each of its children, and thus bring
                the whole tree up to date.</p>
              <p>You can check the default installation location --
                shown as <code>/local-star</code> above -- with
                <kbd>./starconf-status --show
                STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</kbd></p>
              <p>Also, <kbd>make world</kbd> only makes those targets
                listed in the variable <code>ALL_TARGETS</code> within
                the top-level Makefile.  Thus if the component you're
                interested in isn't there, nor required by something
                that is there and that will be rebuilt, nothing will
                happen.  See also <ref id="autoconfing-final"/>.</p>
              <p>See <ref id="state-faqs"/> for a few more remarks
                about state.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>I've updated my checkout of a component.  How do I
              best update the installation of it?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>The most straightforward way is to change to
                the directory in question, and do <kbd>./configure; make;
                  make install</kbd> there.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, you can stay in the top-level
                directory, delete the component's manifest file,
                <kbd>rm /local-star/manifests/cpt</kbd>, and remake it:
                <kbd>make /local-star/manifests/cpt</kbd>.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Actually, the component is one of the buildsupport
              tools.  Is that
              different?<index>buildsupport!updating</index></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Yes.  The best way is
                update your checkout of the component in question,
                then run <kbd>./bootstrap --buildsupport</kbd> in the
                top level of the checkout.  When the bootstrap script
                is run in this mode, it always deletes any
                buildsupport manifests, to ensure that the
                buildsupport tools are <em>always</em> rebuilt if
                updated.</p>
              <p>It's best to avoid the <kbd>./configure; make; make
                install</kbd> route described in the last item.  Some
                of the buildsupport tools need special handling, and
                the <code>./bootstrap</code> script knows how to do that.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>I've updated my checkout and a large number of
              components were updated (or I'm paranoid).  What's the
              best way to remake absolutely everything that needs it?</dt>
            <dd><p>Just doing <kbd>make</kbd> would remake everything
                that needs remaking, but wouldn't install it.  The
                command <kbd>make world</kbd> wouldn't work either,
                because that only works with the dependencies between
                manifest files -- this is the way that the
                <code>Makefile.dependencies</code> file expresses the
                dependencies of components on each other.</p>
              <p>The best way to do this is as follows.  After your
              update, and while in the top-level directory, do
<verbatim>
% rm /local-star/manifests/*
% make buildsupport
% make world
</verbatim>
                That is, you delete <em>all</em> the manifests, and
                remake them.  This does a <code>make; make
                install</code> in each component directory, and that
                step handles any files that were updated.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>What's the best way to generate files at build
              time?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Look at the <code>Makefile.am</code> for the
                <code>prm</code> component.  It's a good example of
                using <code>noinst_</code> tools, the Fortran
                preprocessor, and <code>./configure</code> variables
                in a reasonably tidy way.</p>

              <p>Automake also has support for extending what is cleaned

                extended installation above.  See the

            <dt id="tagged-error">I've just been told that libtool is
              ``unable to infer tagged configuration''.  What on earth
              is that supposed to mean?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean
                <em>exactly</em>, but what it seems to mean in
                practice is that libtool has become terribly confused
                about your compiler and hasn't been configured 
                to recognise it. The most common reason for this 
                is that libtool uses a different set of default compilers
                to those of autoconf, and in particular is not
                as bright about Fortran 95 compilers. The simplest
                way to resolve this is to define <code>F77</code>
                to match the compiler determined by autoconf (or
                indeed define <code>FC</code> and <code>F77</code>
                to be your preferred compiler). </p>

                <p>Other reasons this may happen are when you force
                <code>./configure</code> to use a particular compiler
                by specifying one of the <code>F77</code>,
                <code>FC</code> or <code>CC</code> environment
                variables at configure time.  You may have forgotten
                that you have that variable set.</p>

              <p>Alternatively, you may be unaware that that variable
                is set: a known manifestation of this problem is that
                the IRAF startup script sets <code>F77</code> to be an
                IRAF-specific script, which works OK from the
                command-line (given that you want to use IRAF), but
                which leaves libtool in a confused heap.</p>

              <p>This problem has also been spotted in the form
                <code>libtool: compile: specify a tag with
                  `--tag'</code>, with apparently the same cause.</p>

              <p>See <ref id="configure-script"/> for more discussion
                of these variables.</p>

            <dt>I've just modified an include file, ran make in a component, 
                but nothing has compiled</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                 Automake provides the <code>depcomp</code> command
                 to automatically generate dependencies on include files
                 (these are added to <code>Makefile.in</code>). Unfortunately
                 this support doesn't extend to Fortran, only C, so modifying
                 a file included in Fortran will not result in the 
                 files being recompiled. Also not all C compilers and
                 platforms are supported. To avoid this problem either
                 keep the list of dependencies up to date in the 
                 <code>Makefile.am</code>, or be prepared to clean 
                 directories during development.

                necessary.  A <code>Makefile.am</code> line like
                <code>include_HEADERS = a.h subdir/b.h</code> will
                cause both <code>a.h</code> and <code>b.h</code> to be
                installed in the same place, as indicated by the
                <code>_HEADERS</code> primary.  It means that if you
                had some good reason for creating or distributing the
                header <code>b.h</code> in its subdirectory, you don't
                have to copy it into the top directory just prior to
                installation.  If you specify
                <code>nobase_include_HEADERS</code><index>installation!nobase
                  prefix</index>, on the other
                hand, this will cause the hierarchy to be preserved.
                This is documented rather in passing in the automake
                manual, in the section <webref
                url="&automakehtml;/Alternative.html" >An Alternative
                Approach to Subdirectories</webref> (and no, I don't
                know why `nobase' is supposed to be intuitive,
                either).</p>

              <p>There's an example of using this in <ref
                  id="config-cfitsio"/>.</p>

            <dt>I want to install symbolic links at install time.  How?</dt>

<dt>I want to do weird things at install time.  How?</dt> 
<dd>
<p>Automake provides a couple of escape hatches for
installing extra material.  These are the
<code>install-exec-local</code> and
<code>install-data-local</code> targets for installing
platform-dependent and -independent files.  The
associated rules are run at install time, and can do
anything, the similar <code>install-exec-hook</code>
and <code>install-data-hook</code> targets are run
after all other install targets, and can do
post-installation cleanup and the like.  See section
<webref url="&automakehtml;/Install.html" >What Gets
Installed</webref> in the automake manual for
details.</p>

<p>For example, the <code>dtask</code> component
installs a special object file in the library
directory.  This isn't a program, or script, or
library, and so isn't naturally handled by any other
automake mechanism.  The <code>Makefile.am</code>
there includes the following:
<verbatim>
dtask_main.o: dtask_main.f
install-exec-local: dtask_main.o
        $(mkdir_p) $(DESTDIR)$(libdir)
	$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) dtask_main.o $(DESTDIR)$(libdir)
        $(MANIFEST) &amp;&amp; echo "MANIFEST:$(DESTDIR)$(libdir)/dtask_main.o" || :
</verbatim>
This first creates the library directory if necessary.  The rules then
use the <code>$(INSTALL_PROGRAM)</code> command to install the object
file in the library directory (you'd use <code>$(INSTALL_DATA)</code>
command for a data target)<index
seealso="manifests">installation!manifest</index><index>manifests!special
installation targets</index>.  The installation location is
<code>$(libdir)</code>, which is a location which includes the
<code>$(prefix)</code> variable, so that this install rule behaves as
other such rules do.  Also, it prefixes the installation location with
<code>$(DESTDIR)</code>: this is usually the empty string, but it can
be set to something else to perform a staged installation.  Finally,
if the <code>$(MANIFEST)</code> variable evaluates to true, then we
echo the echo the name of installed file to <code>stdout</code>
prefixed by the string <code>MANIFEST:</code>; note that the command
ends with `<code>|| :</code>', which ensures that this composite command
succeeds even if <code>$(MANIFEST)</code> evaluates to <code>false</code>.
This is a Starlink extension, and is how the manifest file is built up.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a fuss, but it's the consequence of
using the <code>install-xxx-local</code> back door.
Each of these features is important if this hand-made
install rule is to behave the same way as the
automatically-generated rules.  This technique is also
inherently precarious, since if there were ever some
reason to modify the installation conventions (for
example to modify the way the manifests were built
up), then each such back-door would have to be
adjusted by hand.  That is, don't use this mechanism
unless you really have to.</p>

<p>In particular, you often need to create links in this
situation<index>symbolic links!installing</index>.  To 
do that portably (symbolic links are not required by
POSIX, and so the autoconf macros are able to emulate
them if necessary), put the <code>AC_PROG_LN_S</code> macro in
your <code>configure.ac</code>, and use the
<code>$(LN_S)</code> macro in your
<code>Makefile.am</code>.  Note that the autoconf
manual <webref url="&autoconfhtml;/autoconf_40.html"
>notes</webref> that this macro does not in
principle support a path in the second argument; thus
do not write
<code>$(LN_S) /target/TARGET
/link/LINK</code>, but instead
<verbatim>
cd $(DESTDIR)/link; rm -f LINK; $(LN_S) $(DESTDIR)/target/TARGET LINK
</verbatim>
The option <code>rm -f</code> is portable.  Note that
we have included the important <code>$(DESTDIR)</code>
variable here, and that the <code>/link</code> and
<code>/target</code> locations here should probably be
one or other of the <code>$(???dir)</code> variables
instead.</p>

          <title>State FAQs</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>This is only a summary of the various ways that state is
          held within the Starlink build system.  The details are in
          <ref id="tool-state"/>.</p>

        <p>
          <dl>
            <dt>How do I get rid of state in a checked-out directory?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>One of <kbd>make clean</kbd>, <kbd>make
                  distclean</kbd> or <kbd>make maintainer-clean</kbd>
                should do what you want.  The first gets rid of
                compiled files, the second everything but distributed
                files, and the third returns the directory to an
                almost pristine state, though without deleting
                <code>./configure</code> or the files it needs to
                run.</p>
              <p>The nuclear option for clearing state from a
                directory <code>ping</code> is to delete it and check
                it out afresh:
<verbatim>
% cd ..
% cvs release -d ping      # or: mv ping ping-old
% cvs update -d ping
</verbatim>
                The CVS `release' command tells CVS you have finished
                with a particular checkout.  With the <code>-d</code>
                option, it is basically <kbd>rm -rf</kbd>
                <em>except</em> that it checks you have no modified but
                uncommited files left within <code>ping</code>.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>How do I start again?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>As mentioned above, <code>make
                  maintainer-clean</code> in the top level should
                recurse and make <code>maintainer-clean</code> in each
                of the children.  That unmakes and unconfigures
                everything, but doesn't undo the bootstrapping.  The
                bootstrapping done by <code>./bootstrap</code> doesn't
                depend on any state except the contents of the
                manifest files, and to undo that, you need only delete
                the manifest.</p>

              <p>For maintainer-clean to work, one sometimes needs
                to make extra declarations in
                <code>Makefile.am</code>.  There could well be
                components where maintainer-clean doesn't work as
                fully as it ought.  Do mention those if you spot them.
              </p>
            </dd>

            <dt>How do I control where a component is installed?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>In a variety of ways.  In the list below, each mechanism
                effectively supplies the default for the mechanism
                before it.
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>You can specify an installation prefix at
                      install time:
<verbatim>
% make prefix=/odd/place install
</verbatim>
                      This might break your installation if there was
                      a prefix baked in to your component at build
                      time.  Do this only if you have a particular
                      reason for doing so, and know what you're doing.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>At make time:
<verbatim>
% make prefix=/odd/place
</verbatim>
                      This builds your component with the Makefile
                      variable <code>${prefix}</code> set to the given
                      value.  The component will be installed into
                      this location at install time, unless you
                      override the location as described above.  See
                      the discussion of `installation directory
                      variables' in <ref id="automakeoverview"/>.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>At configure time:
<verbatim>
% ./configure --prefix=/odd/place
</verbatim>
                      This is usually the most appropriate way to do
                      this.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>By setting a `sticky variable':
<verbatim>
% ./starconf.status STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX=/odd/place
</verbatim>
                      This sets the default for the
                      <code>./configure</code> script's
                      <code>--prefix</code> option.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>By configuring <em>starconf</em>:
<verbatim>
% pwd
.../buildsupport/starconf
% ./configure STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX=/odd/place
...
% make; make install
</verbatim>
                      This sets the default for all directories
                      configured using this <em>starconf</em> application.
                      This is effectively what you do when you set the
                      environment variable
                      <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX</code> before you
                      run the top-level <code>./bootstrap</code>
                      script, as described in <ref
                        id="bootstrapping"/>.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
            </dd>

            <dt>OK, now I've changed my mind about where I want components
              to be installed -- the `prefix'.  How do I tell the
              build system?</dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Easy.  Set the <code>STARCONF_...</code> variables
                as you want them, as described in <ref
                  id="bootstrapping"/>, and in the top level of the
                checkout, do
<verbatim>
% ./bootstrap --buildsupport
% rm config.cache
</verbatim>
                The <code>--buildsupport</code> option forces the
                bootstrap to remake and reinstall the buildsupport
                components, taking the current values of the
                <code>STARCONF_...</code> variables into account.</p>

              <p>You should also remove any
                <code>config.cache</code> files, both in the
                top-level directory and elsewhere, since these often
                store paths to applications and libraries which
                are probably not appropriate for your new prefix.</p>

              <p>For more details, see the notes on state in <ref
                  id="tool-state"/>.</p>

        <subhead>
          <title>Forcing automake's choice of linking language</title>
        </subhead>

        <p><strong>XXX</strong> no: there's an better mechanism,
          as yet undocumented.  Watch this space, but don't use this
          technique.</p>

        <p>When building a library or application, automake needs to
          make a decision about which language to use to do the final
          link.  For example, it must use the Fortran linker to make a
          library which consists of or includes Fortran modules, and
          the C linker if it consists of pure C.  This matters more on
          some platforms than others -- the OSX linker has some very
          fixed ideas on this point (it heartily disapproves of common
          blocks, and so needs special Fortran juju to make a library
          from Fortran which uses them).</p>

        <p>Automake makes this decision based on the source code which
          is listed in the library's <code>_SOURCES</code> variable.
          When you are assembling a library purely from convenience
          libraries, however (see section `Linking static libraries'
          in the <webref url="&libtoolman;" >Libtool manual</webref>),
          the <code>_SOURCES</code> variable is empty, and automake
          ends up using the C linker, for want of any other
          information.</p>

        <p>You can avoid this problem, and indicate to automake which
          langauge it should use, by giving a dummy value for the
          <code>_SOURCES</code> variable as follows:
<verbatim>
libsubpar_adam_la_SOURCES = dummy_routine.f
libsubpar_adam_la_LIBADD = \
        subpar/libsubpar_convenience.la \
        parsecon/libparsecon_convenience.la
</verbatim>
          where the <code>dummy_fortran.f</code> module is a trivial
          Fortran routine:
<verbatim>
C A dummy Fortran routine.  See comments in Makefile.am
      SUBROUTINE DUMMY
      END
</verbatim>
          As the comment indicates, it is wise to include an
          explanation of this ... let's not call it a hack ... in the
          <code>Makefile.am</code>.</p>

        <p>This is currently used in the `pcs', `gks', `astrom' and `pgplot'
          components.</p>

      <subsect id="tip-conditional-build" export="export">
        <subhead>
          <title>Conditionally building components, I</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>It is occasionally useful to build code conditionally,
          depending on features of the environment.  About the only
          place where this is necessary, however, is when building a
          target of a configure dependency<index>dependencies!configure</index>
          (see <ref id="macro-declare-dependencies"/>), where a library (for
          example) must be built only if it is not available on the
          platform already.</p>

        <p>There is no way to decide not to build a component, so
          instead we arrange the configuration of the component in
          such a way that if the component's code is not required,
          then the component trivially builds and installs nothing, or
          nothing more than a stamp file.</p>

        <p>This is true for the <code>jpeg</code> component, which is
          a configure dependency of <code>startcl</code>, and located in
          the repository in <code>thirdparty/ijg/jpeg</code>.  The
          important parts of <code>jpeg</code>'s
          <code>configure.ac</code> are as follows:
<verbatim>
AC_CHECK_HEADER([jpeglib.h],
  [MAIN_TARGET=jpeglib-stamp],
  [
  (
    cd src
    echo ./configure --prefix=$prefix --cache-file=config.cache
    ./configure --prefix=$prefix --cache-file=config.cache
  )
  MAIN_TARGET=jpeglib
])
AC_SUBST(MAIN_TARGET)

STAR_SPECIAL_INSTALL_COMMAND([
    if test $(MAIN_TARGET) = jpeglib; then
      cd src;
      for d in bin lib include man/man1;
        do $(mkdir_p) $$DESTDIR$(prefix)/$$d;
      done;
      $(MAKE) DESTDIR=$$DESTDIR install install-lib;
    fi])
</verbatim>
          The first part wraps the actual jpeglib configuration code (see
          <ref id="config-tclsys"/> for the rationale for that code)
          inside an autoconf test for the <code>jpeglib.h</code>
          include file.  If it finds it, there is nothing to do; if it
          doesn't then it does actually configure the package.  The
          decision it makes is recorded in the substituted variable
          <code>@MAIN_TARGET@</code> and its corresponding Makefile
          variable <code>$(MAIN_TARGET)</code>.</p>

        <p>Note that the <code>STAR_SPECIAL_INSTALL_COMMAND</code> is
          expanded at a different time from the header test, with the
          effect that it is effective in both conditions, when the
          header file is there and when it isn't.  Thus the command
          inside it must be written with this in mind, and explicitly
          test the value of <code>$(MAIN_TARGET)</code>.</p>

        <p>The <code>Makefile.am</code> has corresponding support, the
          important parts of which are as follows.
<verbatim>
all-local: $(MAIN_TARGET)

jpeglib:
        cd src; $(MAKE) all

jpeglib-stamp:
        rm -f $@
        { date; \
          echo "jpeglib.h found in system -- no need to build our own"; } >$@
</verbatim>
          We can't override the `all' target, but instead use
          automake's `all-local' hook which, if it is present, is

          determined and substituted by <code>configure.ac</code>, we
          build either the jpeglib software, or a stamp file.  The
          install command in the <code>configure.ac</code> file above
          then avoids installing anything if
          <code>$(MAIN_TARGET)</code> is not the string
          <code>jpeglib</code>.</p>

        <p>The other way in which you might conditionally build a

        <subhead>
          <title>Manipulating compiler and linker flags</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>Sometimes it is necessary to add compiler or linker flags
          for particular make targets, or add libraries to a link.
          This is described in the automake manual, in the section
          <webref
            url="&automakehtml;/Program-and-Library-Variables.html"
            >Program and Library Variables</webref>.  This is a
          powerful mechanism, but there is a gotcha.</p>

        <p>For each of the variables <code>CFLAGS</code>,
          <code>LDFLAGS</code> and so on, automake maintains a
          parallel variable <code>AM_CFLAGS</code> or
          <code>AM_LDFLAGS</code><index>flags, compiler and linker!AM_
          flags</index>, the contents
          of which are managed by automake and autoconf, so that the
          unprefixed variables are free to be overridden by the user
          (see section <webref
          url="&automakehtml;/User-Variables.html" >Variables reserved
          for the user</webref> of the automake manual; to be clear,
          `user' in this context means the person building the
          distributed software, as opposed to the maintainer, or
          whoever is creating the distribution).  If automake
          sees one of the above per-target variables, however, it
          carefully uses this <em>instead</em> of the <code>AM_</code>
          variable, not in addition to it.  This replacement is
          sensible, since if this were not the case then there would
          be no way to remove a problematic flag from an
          <code>AM_</code> variable, but it is not the behaviour you
          might guess at first, and so can come as rather a surprise.
          Given that you want to add to these flags rather than
          replace them, you do so with the idiom:
<verbatim>
libxxx_la_FCFLAGS = $(AM_FCFLAGS) -my-magic-flag
</verbatim>
        </p>

        <p>An alternative to setting per-target flags like this is to
          set one or more of the <code>AM_*FLAGS</code> variables
          directly.  These variables
          are `yours' as the author of the <code>Makefile.am</code>
          and <code>configure.ac</code> files -- the automake system
          ensures that the variables are included in the correct
          places in compile and link commands, but neither it nor
          autoconf set these flags.  See the FAQ on `Flag Variables
          Ordering' in the <webref url="&automakehtml;" >automake
          manual</webref> for some further discussion.</p>

        <p>There is another set of similar variables, named
          <code>STAR_*FLAGS</code><index>flags, compiler and
          linker!STAR_ flags</index>, which are maintained by
          <code>starconf</code> and the <code>STAR_*</code> macros in
          <code>configure.ac</code>, and which are the means by which
          those macros pass their discovered magic on to the Makefile.
          You shouldn't need to know that, and you should not need to
          adjust these variables at all, but if for some occult reason
          you need to refer to the complete set of flags used to
          compile and link programs, you will need to include these
          flags also.  In general, Makefile variables such as
          <code>$(COMPILE)</code> and <code>$(FCCOMPILE)</code> are
          most suitable for any by-hand compilations you need to do,
          and they already have all the extra flags you need, in the
          right order..</p>

          <title>The Starconf macros and variables</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>The following macros may be used within the
          <code>configure.ac</code> file.  Of these, only the
          <code>STAR_DEFAULTS</code> macro is required to be in the
          file.</p>

        <p>In the descriptions below, optional arguments are shown in
          square brackets, along with their default value.  If the
          sole argument is optional (for example in the case of
          <code>STAR_DEFAULTS</code>), you do not need to supply the
          brackets.</p>

        <p>The macros below ultimately do their work by expanding into
          shell script, and these results are exposed in the
          <code>./configure</code> file.  Although it can occasionally
          be useful to examine these implementation details, resist the
          temptation to write your <code>configure.ac</code> scripts
          based on what you find there.  If macro behaviour is not
          documented here, you should not rely on it.  If you
          <em>need</em> to rely on it, then consult with the starconf
          maintainer to have the documentation changed, and the
          behaviour thus fixed.</p>

          <p><strong>AC_FC_CHECK_INTRINSICS (function...)</strong></p>

          <p>Like <code>AC_CHECK_FUNCS</code>, but instead determine
            the intrinsics available to the Fortran compiler.  For
            each intrinsic in the (whitespace-separated and
            case-insensitive) argument list, define
            <code>HAVE_INTRINSIC_intrinsic</code> if it is available.
            For example, <code>AC_FC_CHECK_INTRINSICS(sin)</code>
            would define <code>HAVE_INTRINSIC_SIN</code> if the `sin'
            intrinsic function were available (there are probably
            rather few Fortrans which don't have this function).
          </p>

          <p>There are some functions, such as <code>getcwd</code>,
            <code>getenv</code> and <code>chdir</code>, which are
            provided as intrinsics by some Fortran compilers, but
            which others supply as external routines in the Fortran
            runtime<index>Fortran!intrinsics and external
            functions</index>.  To deal with this (exasperating)
            situation, you need a construction like this in your
            <code>configure.ac</code>:
<verbatim>
AC_FC_CHECK_INTRINSICS([getcwd])
AC_LANG_PUSH([Fortran])
AC_CHECK_FUNCS([getcwd])
AC_LANG_POP([Fortran])
</verbatim>
            and then conditionalise on the defines
            <code>HAVE_GETCWD</code> and
            <code>HAVE_INTRINSIC_GETCWD</code> in your preprocessable
            code.  That is, you use the standard macro
            <code>AC_CHECK_FUNCS</code>, but wrapped in declarations
            which force the check to use Fortran (this doesn't work in
            standard autoconf, since the required support is
            missing).</p>

<p><strong>AC_FC_LITERAL_BACKSLASH</strong></p>

<p>Check whether the compiler regards the backslash character as an
escape character.  The backslash is not in the Fortran character set,
so ISO-1539 does not specify how this is to be interpreted, but
many Unix Fortran compilers interpret <code>'\n'</code>, for example,
as a newline, and <code>'\\'</code> as a single backslash.  Many
Unix compilers have switches which allow you to choose between these
two modes.</p>

<p>This macro tests the behaviour of the currently selected compiler,
and defines <code>FC_LITERAL_BACKSLASH</code> to 1 if backslashes are
treated literally -- that is if <code>'\\'</code> is interpreted as a
<em>pair</em> of backslashes and thus that <code>'\n'</code> is
interpreted as a pair of characters rather than a newline.</p>

<p>Note that, if you simply want to have a character constant which
contains a single backslash, then the following initialisation will do
that for you without any need for this macro (thanks to Peter Draper).
<verbatim>
*  Printable backslash: some compilers need '\\' to get '\', which
*  isn't a problem as Fortran will truncate the string '\\' to '\'
*  on the occasions when that isn't needed.
      CHARACTER * ( 1 ) CCD1__BKSLH
      PARAMETER ( CCD1__BKSLH = '\\' )

Fortran is required to truncate the initialising string without error,
as noted in ISO-1539 sections 5.2.9 and 7.5.1.</p>

          <p>The Fortran OPEN statement is a rich source of
            portability problems, since there are numerous common
            extensions which consiste of extra specifiers, several of
            which are useful when they are available.  For each of the
            specifiers in the (whitespace-separated) argument list,
            define <code>HAVE_FC_OPEN_</code><em>mungedspecifier</em> if the
            specifier may be given as argument to the OPEN statement.
            The <em>mungedspecifier</em> is the
            <em>specifier</em> converted to uppercase and with all
            characters outside <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code> deleted.
            Note that this may include `specifiers' such as
            <code>access='append'</code> and
            <code>[access='sequential',recl=1]</code> (note quoting of
            comma) to check combinations of specifiers.  You may not
            include a space in the `specifier', even quoted.  Each
            argument must be a maximum of 65 characters in length (to
            abide by Fortran 77 line-length limits).</p>

            <code>RECL</code>; however in the case of unformatted
            direct access files, the <em>units</em> of this specifier
            are processor dependent, and may be words or bytes.  This
            macro determines the units and defines
            <code>FC_RECL_UNIT</code> to contain the number of bytes
            (1, 2, 4, 8, ...) in the processor's unit of measurement.</p>

          <p>Note that unformatted files are not themselves portable,
            and should only be used as either temporary files, or as
            data files which will be read by a program or library
            compiled with the same Fortran processor.  With this

            the requested set of 
            features.  If so, it arranges for the compilation to be done
            `directly'; if not, it arranges for `indirect' compilation,
            where the preprocessable Fortran code is converted to pure

            You do not generally need to know or care about the above
            variables, since if you have any preprocessable source
            files in your source set, then automake will insert
            appropriate build rules in the generated
            <code>Makefile.in</code> on your behalf.  If, however, you
            need to run the preprocessor `by hand' for some reason
            (perhaps because you are using the preprocessor to do
            something other than compiling <code>.F</code> to
            <code>.o</code>, so that the <code>.F</code> file is not
            being mentioned in a <code>_SOURCES</code> primary),
            then a suitable stanza in a <code>Makefile.am</code>
            or <code>Makefile.in</code> would be:
<verbatim>
file.f: file.$(FPP_SRC_EXT)
        $(FPP) $(FPPFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) file.$(FPP_SRC_EXT) $(FPP_OUTPUT)
</verbatim>
            where we have ensured that the input file has the
            extension <code>$(FPP_SRC_EXT)</code>.  You can
            add extra options such as <code>-I.</code> if necessary
            (automake puts these in the variable
            <code>$(DEFAULT_INCLUDES)</code>).

            (=nodefine), now (=nowrap).</p>

          <p>Default for the feature list is 
            [include define substitute nowrap nocstyle noCSTYLE]</p>

          <p>Feature requirements corresponding to the defaults may be

          <p>Note that "wrap" implies "substitute", and CSTYLE and
            cstyle cannot be requested at the same time. The macro
            adjusts this automatically. </p>

          </subhead>

          <p><strong><code>STAR_CHECK_PROGS(progs-to-check-for, [package=''])</code></strong></p>

          <p><strong>Note: The functionality of this macro is very likely to change.</strong></p>

          <p>For each of the programs in
            <code>PROGS-TO-CHECK-FOR</code>, define a variable whose
            name is the upcased version of the program name, and whose
            value is the full path to that program, or the expected
            installation location of that program if no absolute path
            can be found.  Because of this default behaviour, this
            macro should _only_ be used for locating Starlink programs
            such as messgen or alink, and not as a general replacement
            for
            <code>AC_CHECK_PROG</code><index>autoconf!macros!AC_CHECK_PROG
            and STAR_CHECK_PROGS</index>.
            Any characters in the 
            program outside of the set of alphanumerics and
            underscores are normalised to underscores.</p>

          <p>The optional second argument gives the name of the
            package containing the program in question.  Some packages
            install their binaries in package-specific directories, and
            this argument allows this macro to look there as well.</p>

          <p>For example: <code>STAR_CHECK_PROGS(messgen)</code>
            would define the variable <code>MESSGEN</code> to have the
            full path to the messgen application.</p>

          <p>Calls AC_SUBST and AC_ARG_VAR on the generated variable
            name.</p>

          <p>This is the analogue of <code>AC_CHECK_PROG</code>,
            except that: (1) the variable name defaults to the program
            name, (2) if the program is not found, the variable value
            is the program's name without any path at all.</p>

          <p>The current value of the <code>PATH</code> variable is
            augmented by the location of the binary installation
            directory, using the current default value of the prefix
            (not ideal, since this may in principle change when the
            component being configured is installed, but it's the best
            we can do at configure time); and by the
            <code>$STARLINK/bin</code>,
            <code>$STARLINK/Perl/bin</code> and
            <code>$STARLINK/starjava/bin</code> 
            directories (so this is a suitable macro to use to locate the
            distributed Perl binary).</p>

          <p>If the program in question cannot be found, the the
            substitution variable is set to be the name of the program
            without any path, in the expectation or hope that the
            program will eventually end up in the path.  This is not
            ideal, but it is the best that can be done in the
            important case where the program is being configured as
            part of bootstrapping build, and thus before any packages
            have been built and installed, so that there is in fact no
            installed program to be found.  This heuristic will
            obviously fail when the program to be checked for is not
            in the path, and this will typically happen when
            the second `package' argument is non-null.  The pattern to
            use in this case is as follows.</p>

          <p>Some components build their documentation using the (now
            deprecated) <code>sst</code> component.  This uses the
            <code>per-package-dirs</code> option, and so installs its
            applications in a package-specific directory.  You would
            therefore check for the <code>prolat</code> tool (for
            example) in <code>configure.ac</code> using
            <code>STAR_CHECK_PROGS(prolat,sst)</code>.  If the
            <code>sst</code> component is in fact installed, this
            would substitute <code>@PROLAT@</code> with the full path
            to the application; but in a bootstrap build could do no
            more than subsitute it with the bare program name
            <code>prolat</code>, as described above.  In order to use
            this within a <code>Makefile.am</code>, you would have to
            use a rule like
<verbatim>
target: dependency
        PATH=$$PATH:$(STARLINK)/bin/sst @PROLAT@ args...
</verbatim>
            where the <code>PATH</code> is temporarily augmented with
            the installation location of the <code>sst</code>
            component.  This is pretty safe, because the
            <code>STARLINK</code> Makefile variable is always present
            and always substituted.  Despite that, it is not ideal, since it
            depends on undocumented (but unlikely to change in
            practice) knowledge of how the <code>sst</code> component
            is installed, and it is possible to think of convoluted
            installation schemes which might trip this up.  Given that,
            the only time this is likely to matter is during a
            bootstrap build (at other times, <code>prolat</code> would
            be installed already and so <code>@PROLAT@</code> would be
            substituted with a full path), so it is unlikely to be a
            problem in practice.</p>

          <p>Work out what is required to have the Fortran compiler
            produce library symbols which are compatible with those
            expected by the CNF package.  If you are building a
            library which includes Fortran code, then you should call
            this macro, which possibly adjusts the
            <code>FCFLAGS</code> variable.</p>

          <p>At present, all this macro has to do is simply work out
            whether it needs to stop g77 adding a second underscore to
            generated symbol names (it adds a single underscore to
            most Fortran symbols, but by default adds two when the
            symbol name already contains an underscore); the other
            Fortran compilers we use don't need any extra options, as
            it happens.  However this could potentially be much more
            complicated.  The autoconf <code>AC_F77_WRAPPERS</code>
            macro detects more possibilities, but probably not a
            completely exhaustive set.  In future it might be
            necessary to extend the CNF macros, by somehow merging the
            results of <code>AC_F77_WRAPPERS</code> into it, and at
            that point it might be necessary to extend this macro.</p>

          <p>This macro is designed to work with CNF, however it
            does <em>not</em> require the <code>cnf.h</code> headers
            to be installed, because it should remain callable at
            configuration time before <em>anything</em> has been
            installed.  Instead we fake the functionality of the
            definition <code>F77_EXTERNAL_NAME</code> in
            <code>cnf.h</code>, which appends an underscore (just one)
            to the end of C symbols.</p>

          <p>This is less complicated than it seems.  The only types
            you're likely to have to specify are `build' and `link'

                  installed by the component <em>D</em>), then that
                  second component has a <em>build</em> dependency on
                  <em>D</em>: <em>C</em>'s <code>configure.ac</code>

                  <em>C</em>, but it does have to be present, at some
                  later stage, in order to link against it:
                  <code>STAR_DECLARE_DEPENDENCIES(link,D)</code></p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>If <em>D</em> is a library which we need to link
                  against in order to build our component <em>C</em>
                  (which is almost certainly an application), then
                  this is still a build dependency on <em>D</em>, but
                  we must indicate that we depend on all of
                  <em>D</em>'s link dependencies also:

          <p>In full, the types of dependencies are as follows:

              <dt>Sourceset dependencies</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>These are the components which must be installed in

                  <code>star2html</code> as well as
                  <code>messgen</code>.  These dependencies are

                <p>These are the dependencies which are required in
                  order to build this component.  This is typically
                  because you require include files installed by the
                  other component, but it might also be because you
                  require an executable built by it (such as the
                  <code>compifl</code> tool within the
                  <code>parsecon</code> component).  See also the
                  discussion of `option', below.  You may not have two
                  components which have a build dependency on each
                  other, since that would mean that each would have to

              <dd>
                <p>These are the dependencies required to link
                  against the libraries in a component.  That means
                  all the libraries that this component's libraries
                  use.  These are not necessarily build dependencies,
                  since if you are building a library <em>X</em>,
                  which uses functions in library <em>Y</em>, the
                  library <em>Y</em> does not have to be present in
                  order to <em>build</em> library <em>X</em>, only
                  when you subsequently want to actually link against
                  it.  Thus you can have two components which have 
                  mutual link dependencies.  If you are building an
                  application, however, all its link dependencies
                  will actually be build dependencies and should be
                  declared as such.  In other words, the distinction
                  between build and link dependencies is important
                  only for library components.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt>Configure dependencies</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>There are some components which must be installed
                  <em>before</em> the configure step, since they must
                  be present in order for other packages to configure
                  against them.  Components which are listed as a
                  configure dependency of some other component are
                  made during the <code>make configure-deps</code>
                  stage of the bootstrapping build process.</p>

                <p>You should try hard to avoid declaring dependencies
                  of this type, since they necessarily subvert the
                  normal build order.  Note that transitivity implies
                  that any dependencies of a configure dependency are
                  also configure dependencies, so that declaring a
                  configure dependency on sst for example (an obvious
                  but bad plan), results in half the software set
                  being built before configuration.  Which is crazy.</p>

                <p>You can see the set of configure dependencies by
                  looking at the <code>configure-deps</code> target in
                  <code>Makefile.dependencies</code>.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt>Use dependencies</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>These are the dependencies required in
                  order for the component to be used by something
                  else, after it has been built and installed.  For
                  example a library which called another application
                  as part of its functionality would have only a use
                  dependency on the component which contained that
                  application.  If no use dependencies are declared,
                  we take the use dependencies to be the same as the
                  link dependencies.  We expect that such use
                  dependencies will become more important when we
                  start using this dependency information to build
                  distribution packages, or to assemble
                  <code>.rpm</code> or <code>.deb</code> packages.
                  You should add any use dependencies you are aware
                  of, even though we cannot really debug them until a
                  distribution system is in place.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt>Test dependencies</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>These are required in
                  order to run any regression tests which come with
                  the component.  It's generally a good idea to avoid
                  making this a larger set than the use dependencies,
                  but sometimes this is unavoidable.  If no test
                  dependencies are declared, we take the test
                  dependencies to be the same as the use
                  dependencies.  Note that the system does not
                  currently make any use of this information.</p>
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </p>

          <p>The point of all this is that different dependencies are
            required at different times.  The set of dependencies in
            the master makefile is composed of all the `sourceset' and
            `build' dependencies, but not `link' or `use'
            dependencies, and since the core Starlink libraries are
            closely interdependent, the set of `build' dependencies
            needs to be kept as small as possible in order to avoid
            circularities (that is, A depending on B, which depends,
            possibly indirectly, on A).</p>

          <p>It is because of this intricacy that the dependencies
            scheme is so complicated.  <em>In general, it is safe to declare
            most things to have build dependencies</em>, and only
            refine these into link or use dependencies when things
            won't work otherwise.</p>

          <p>All these relationships are transitive: if A has a build
            dependency on B, and B has one on C, then A has a build
            dependency on C.  You can augment this by using the final
            `option' argument: if, in component A's
            <code>configure.ac</code>, you say
            <code>STAR_DECLARE_DEPENDENCIES(build, B, link)</code>,
            then you declare that A has a build-time dependency on B,
            but that (presumably because B is a component consisting
            entirely or mostly of libraries) you need to link against
            B, so component A has a dependency on all of B's
            <em>link</em> dependencies, not just its build
            dependencies.  An application component should generally
            declare such a dependency for each of the libraries it
            depends on.  This is (I believe) the only case where this
            `option' attribute is useful, though it is legal for each
            of the dependency types.</p>

          <p>Because of the transitivity, you need only declare direct
            dependencies.  If package
            A depends on package B, which depends in turn on package
            C, then package A need not declare a dependency on C.</p>

          <p>The macro may be called more than once.  The results of
            this macro are expressed in the file
            <code>component.xml</code> in the component directory.</p>

          <p>Sets up the defaults for Starlink
            <code>configure.ac</code> files.  The optional
            <code>OPTIONS</code> argument holds a space-separated list

            present are <code>per-package-dirs</code> and
            <code>docs-only</code>.</p>

          <p>As part of its initialisation, this macro does the following:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Makes sure that the variable <code>STARLINK</code>
                  is defined, so that you can use it elsewhere in your
                  <code>configure.ac</code> file.  The value of this
                  variable depends on the
                  <code>STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</code><index>environment variables!STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK</index>
                  variable which is defined by the
                  <code>./starconf.status</code> script (see <ref
                    id="starconf"/>), and can be
                  overridden by a setting of <code>STARLINK</code> in
                  the environment, though you are discouraged from
                  doing that.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Sets appropriate vales for variables

                  (you shouldn't have to care, as the point of these

                  to the unprefixed variables with the similar names,

                  the major, minor and release numbers extracted from
                  <code>PACKAGE_VERSION</code>, and an integer
                  representation of these consisting of <code>major *

          </p>

          <p>This macro also sets the <code>prefix</code> shell
            variable to its default value.  Standard autoconf
            <code>./configure</code> scripts also do this, but at a
            slightly later stage, which prevents the variable being
            used safely within <code>configure.ac</code> scripts.
            This is useful if you have to configure a thirdparty
            package in a subdirectory, by calling its
            <code>./configure</code> script with a suitable
            <code>--prefix</code> option.</p>

          <p>The option
            <code>per-package-dirs</code><index>per-package-dirs</index>,
            has three consequences:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>applications, help and etc files are installed in a
                  package-specific directory (however the
                  <code>fac_*_err</code> files are regarded as being
                  in a separate category, and still install in
                  <code>/star/help</code>, without any
                  package-specific prefix);</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>the otherwise-forbidden variable
                <code>bin_DATA</code> is permitted: any files assigned
                to this variable are installed in the
                (package-specific) binary directory as data, as
                opposed to executables;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>a file <code>version.dat</code> is
                created<index>version.dat</index> (at make 
                rather than install time).  This holds the bare
                <code>PACKAGE_VERSION</code> number, and is installed in the
                binary directory.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            See also <ref id="developments"/>.
          </p>

          <p>The <code>docs-dir</code> option declares that this
            component contains only documentation (or at least, no
            code).  This triggers mild changes in the behaviour of the
            <code>STAR_DEFAULTS</code> macro which should make
            configuration somewhat faster in this case.  Certain other
            macros, such as <code>STAR_MESSGEN</code><index>starconf!macros!STAR_MESSGEN</index>, are disabled.</p>

          <p><strong><code>STAR_LARGEFILE_SUPPORT</code></strong></p>

          <p>Set macros for compiling C routines that want to make use of
          large file support. This is a joining of
          <code>AC_SYS_LARGEFILE</code> and <code>AC_FUNC_FSEEKO</code> so
          defines the macros <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS</code>,
          <code>_LARGEFILE_SOURCE</code> and <code>_LARGE_FILES</code> as
          needed , along with <code>HAVE_FSEEKO</code> when
          <code>fseeko</code> and <code>ftello</code> are available. 
          </p>

          <p>To use large file support you need to use fseeko and ftello,
          instead of fseek and ftell, when <code>HAVE_FSEEKO</code> is defined
          (and use type <code>off_t</code> for offsets) and compile all C code
          with the other defines (many of the usual system calls are replaced
          with large file supporting ones, when this is done).
          </p>

          <p>Currently the <code>AC_FUNC_FSEEKO</code> macro does not define
          <code>_LARGEFILE_SOURCE</code> under Solaris, so this function makes
          sure that this is done. It also gathers the values of
          <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS</code>, <code>_LARGEFILE_SOURCE</code> and
          <code>_LARGE_FILES</code> and sets the
          <code>STAR_LARGEFILE_CFLAGS</code> variable so that it can be used
          as part of CFLAGS when compiling. This in useful for passing to
          packages which are not directly part of the starconf system. Note
          that normally the necessary defines are written to
          <code>config.h</code> or are already made part of the local
          <code>CFLAGS</code>, so this variable is not needed.

          <p><strong><code>STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION(documentcode, [targets=''])</code></strong></p>

          <p>Generate the standard makefile targets to handle &latex;
            documentation source<index>documentation</index>.  The
            parameter <code>documentcode</code> should be a
            space-separated list of codes like `sun123' -- they must
            not include any <code>.tex</code> extension.  Each of the
            documentcodes may optionally be followed by a slash, to
            indicate that the source file is not in the current
            directory; see below.</p>

          <p>The second, optional, argument gives an explicit list
            of the targets which are build.  If this is <em>not</em>
            specified, then a standard list is used
            (<code>.tex</code>, <code>.ps</code> and
            <code>.tar_htx</code> at present, though this is in
            principle subject to change) and corresponding rules added to
            the generated makefile.  If it is specified, it must be
            non-null, and its value is a list of files which are to be
            added to the distribution, and no extra Makefile rules are
            added.  Thus if users need anything complicated done, they
            should use this second argument and provide rules for
            satisfying the given targets.</p>

          <p>In the latter case, the <code>.tex -> htx_tar</code> rule
            is still emitted, so you can use it, but it requires the
            substitution variable <code>@STAR2HTML@</code>, and so if
            you <em>do</em> use it, you will have to make that
            available, either through
            <code>STAR_CHECK_PROGS(star2html)</code> or otherwise (see
            <ref id="macro-check-progs"/>).  If you need to tune the
            parameters used when running the <code>star2html</code> command, 
            then assign these to the <code>STAR2HTML_FLAGS</code>
            macro in <code>Makefile.am</code>.</p>

          <p>The default rule for compiling &latex; files simply runs &latex;
            twice.  If you need to do more than this -- for example to
            run BibTeX or make an index -- then you can override this
            by setting the variable <code>LATEX2DVI</code> in the
            <code>configure.ac</code> file; it is already substituted
            with a default value, so you don't have to call
            <code>AC_SUBST</code> on it.  This variable should refer
            to &latex; as <code>$$LATEX</code>, and use
            <code>$$1</code> to refer to the root of the
            &latex; file to be compiled (that is, the filename with
            any <code>.tex</code> extension removed).  The doubled dollar
            signs are because this is evaluated within the context of
            a `make' rule.  Thus if you needed to run
            BibTeX between the &latex; runs, you would define:
<verbatim>
LATEX2DVI='$$LATEX $$1; bibtex $$1; $$LATEX $$1'
</verbatim></p>

          <p>This macro defines the substitution variable
            <code>@STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION@</code> to be the second
            macro argument if that is present, or the default target
            list if not.  This variable must therefore be used as a value
            for the <code>stardocs_DATA</code> Makefile variable (see
            <ref id="variable-starxxxdata"/>).</p>

          </subhead>

          <p>The <code>STAR_MANIFEST_DIR</code> substitution variable
            is slightly special<index>manifests</index>.  If it is
            defined in your
            <code>configure.ac</code> file, then Starlink automake
            will include in the generated <code>Makefile.in</code>
            code to create and install a manifest of all the files
            installed.</p>

          <p>If you set this variable at installation time:
<verbatim>
make STAR_MANIFEST_DIR=/my/special/manifest install
</verbatim>
            then this overrides the manifest location defaulted at
            configure time.  If the variable is set to be null
            (<code>make STAR_MANIFEST_DIR= install</code>)
            then you will suppress the creation and installation of
            the manifest.</p>

          <p>You define it as follows:
<verbatim>
: ${STAR_MANIFEST_DIR='$(prefix)/manifests'}
AC_SUBST(STAR_MANIFEST_DIR)
</verbatim>
            This sets the variable to be
            <code>$(prefix)/manifests</code>, but allows it to be
            overridden by a setting of the variable in the
            environment.  Note that is is set to be relative to the
            value of the <code>$(prefix)</code> makefile variable.</p>

          <p>You do <em>not</em> have to set this in general, as this
            is one of the things that the
            <code>STAR_DEFAULTS</code><index>starconf!macros!STAR_DEFAULTS</index>
            macro (<ref id="macro-defaults"/>) takes care of.  The
            only time you need to use this feature is when you are
            importing a third-party code set into the tree (as
            described in <ref id="importing-thirdparty"/>).  In that
            case, you do not want to specify <code>STAR_DEFAULTS</code> in the
            <code>configure.ac</code>, but you do need to install a
            manifest.  If there is more than one
            <code>configure.ac</code> file in the tree, you will have
            to add this for each one.</p>

          <p><strong><code>STAR_MESSGEN([msgfile-list])</code></strong></p>

          <p>Handle generating message, error, and facility files.</p>

          <p>Declare that we will need to use the messgen utility.
            This macro does not by itself cause the messgen rules to
            be included in the makefile -- that is done by automake,
            when it sees a <code>include_MESSAGES</code> variable.</p>

          <p>In the <code>Makefile.am</code> you declare the
            <code>include_MESSAGES</code><index>include_MESSAGES</index>
            or <code>noinst_MESSAGES</code>
            variable to have as value each of the error files you
            require from the <code>.msg</code> file.  For example, you
            might write:
<verbatim>
include_MESSAGES = ast_err.h AST_ERR
</verbatim>
            to generate, install and distribute the C and Fortran
            error message files.  You may
            include a <code>_SOURCES</code> declaration to indicate
            the name of the <code>.msg</code> file, but the default
            value (<code>ast_err.msg</code> in this case) is usually
            correct.  The files thus listed are installed in the same
            include directory as other header files.  You should not
            list a file in both <code>include_MESSAGES</code> and
            <code>include_HEADER</code>.</p>

          <p>If you need to work with an error file which is not
            public, you can declare it with
            <index>installation!noinst prefix</index>
<verbatim>
noinst_MESSAGES = dat_err.h
</verbatim>
            Such a file is generated but not installed.  In order that
            it be distributed, you should include
            <code>$(noinst_MESSAGES)</code> in the <code>_SOURCES</code>
            declaration of the program which includes it.</p>

          <p>Although it's difficult to see why you'd want to, you can
            include the <code>nodist_</code> prefix with this
            primary.<index>distribution!nodist prefix</index></p>

          <p>You do not need to mention the <code>fac_xxx_err</code>
            file which messgen also generates -- this is generated and
            installed automatically.</p>

          <p>The optional argument is a space-separated list of files,
            each of which has a set of message declarations in it, in
            the format prescribed by the messgen utility.  If this is
            present, then the named files are declared as
            pre-distribution files (the macro calls <ref
            id="macro-predist-sources"
            >STAR_PREDIST_SOURCES</ref><index>starconf!macros!STAR_PREDIST_SOURCES</index>
            on them), and so the resulting configure script should
            expect not to find them in an unpacked distribution.  This
            is useful as documentation or as a shortcut for calling
            the latter macro, but recall that it is the presence of
            the automake <code>include_MESSAGES</code> variable which
            does the work.</p>

          <p>The macro may be called more than once if you have more
            than one <code>.msg</code> file in the directory.</p>

          <p>The files which this generates should be declared as
            sources in the Makefile.am if they are to be used in code,
            or are to be installed.  For example:
<verbatim>
bin_PROGRAMS = foo
foo_SOURCES = foo.c $(include_MESSAGES)

include_MESSAGES = foo_err.h

BUILT_SOURCES = $(include_MESSAGES)
</verbatim>
            If they are used in building the package, you will
            probably need to declare them additionally as
            <code>BUILT_SOURCES</code><index>BUILT_SOURCES</index>.</p>

          <p>The macro also implicitly declares a `sourceset'
            dependency on the messgen package.</p>

          <p>Note that the declarations done in the
            <code>Makefile.am</code>, declaring the name of the
            monolith and the names and source files of the tasks, are
            slightly redundant inasmuch as some of that information
            could be implied.  However, this is required to be
            explicit for clarity and consistency, and so accomodate
            the (currently unexploited) possibility that the tasks and
            <code>.ifl</code> files longer have the one-task-per-file
            relationship they have now.</p>

          <p>Sets substitution variable <code>TCL_CFLAGS</code> to the
            C compiler flags necessary to compile with Tcl,
            <code>TCL_LIBS</code> to the required library flags, and
            variable <code>TCLSH</code> to the full path of the
            matching <code>tclsh</code> executable
            and <code>TCL_VERSION</code> to the <code>major.minor</code>
            version number; if Tk is
            requested, it similarly sets <code>TK_CFLAGS</code>,
            <code>TK_LIBS</code> and <code>WISH</code>.  Define the
            cpp variable <code>TCL_MISSING</code> to 1 if the required
            programs and libraries are not available (that is, it is
            also set if Tcl is available but a suitable version of Tk
            isn't).</p>

          <p>If argument <code>minversion</code> is present, it specifies the
            minimum Tcl/Tk version number required.</p>

          <p>If the argument <code>options</code> is present, it is a
            space-separated list of the words <code>tk</code> and
            <code>itcl</code>.  If one or both of these is present,
            then the macro will find a Tcl location which also has Tk
            or itcl installed (note that the itcl test doesn't do
            anything at present).</p>

          <p>The macro searches first in the path, and then in a
            selection of platform-specific standard locations.  The
            configure option
            <code>--with-tcl</code><index>configure!options!--with-tcl</index> allows
            you to 
            provide a path to a <code>tclsh</code> binary, which is
            put at the head of the list of locations to search.
            Option <code>--without-tcl</code> suppresses the search,
            and results in no variables being substituted.</p>

          <p>Generate the given target-file for each of the files in
            the list <code>TARGET-FILE-LIST</code>, by selecting the

            based on the value of <code>AC_CANONICAL_BUILD</code>.
            Both lists are space-separated lists.</p>

          <p>For each of the platforms, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, in
            platform-list, there should be a file
            <code>&lt;target-file&gt;&lt;p&gt;</code>.  There should
            always be a file <code>&lt;target-file&gt;default</code>,
            and if none of the platform-list strings matches, this is
            the file which is used.  If the `default' file is listed
            in the `platform-list', then it is matched in the normal
            run of things; if it is not listed, it still matches, but
            a warning is issued.</p>

          <p>If you wish no match <em>not</em> to be an error --
            perhaps because there is a platform-dependent file which
            is redundant on unlisted platforms -- then end the
            platform-list with <code>NONE</code>.  In this case, if no
            file matches, then no link is made, with no error or
            warning.</p>

          <p>This macro uses the results of ./config.guess to
            determine the current platform.  That returns a triple
            consisting of cpu-vendor-os, such as
            `<code>i686-pc-linux-gnu</code>' (OS=linux-gnu),
            `<code>sparc-sun-solaris2.9</code>', or
            `<code>alphaev6-dec-osf5.1</code>'.</p>

          <p>The extensions <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> in platform-list
            should all have the form `<code>cpu_vendor[_os]</code>',
            where each of the components `cpu', `vendor' and `os' may
            be blank.  If not blank, they are matched as a prefix of
            the corresponding part of the config.guess value.  Thus
            `<code>_sun_solaris</code>' would match
            `<code>sparc-sun-solaris2.9</code>' but not
            `<code>sparc-sun-sunos</code>', and `<code>_sun</code>'
            would match both.  For a <code>&lt;target-file&gt;</code>
            file foo.c, this would result in `<code>ln -s foo.c_sun
            foo.c</code>'.</p>

            found, then the substitution 
            variable <code>PREDIST</code> is set to a blank rather
            than the comment character <code>#</code>.  This means
            that Makefile rules which are intended to work only in the
            pre-distribution state -- for example to generate
            distributed sources -- should appear in
            <code>Makefile.am</code> with each line prefixed by
            <code>@PREDIST@</code>.  After configuration, these rules
            will be enabled or disabled depending on the presence or
            absence of the marker files listed in this macro.</p>

          <p>We should find either all of the marker files or none of
            them; if some but not all are found, this is probably an
            error of some type, so warn about it.  This means, by the
            way, that it is the presence or absence of the first
            marker file which determines whether we are in the
            pre-distribution or post-distribution state, with the rest
            providing consistency checks.</p>

          <p>The macro may be called more than once.  Multiple calls
            are equivalent to a single call with all the marker files
            in the list.  Automake checks that the files listed here
            are not in the list of distributed files, and issues a
            warning if they are.</p>

          <p>If you use this <code>@PREDIST@</code> variable, then it
            is important to refer to all the files thus protected in a
            <code>STAR_PREDIST_SOURCES</code> call.  The build will
            possibly still work if you forget to do this, but if so
            you are discarding a potentially useful consistency
            check.</p>

          <p>This macro supports the use of the <code>VAL__</code> constants

          if any special compiler flags are required to support PRM's use of

          typeless BOZ support any special flags that are required for that. 
          </p>
          <p> In fact this macro is only currently of use with the gfortran

          integers can silently overflow (BOZ constants are replaced with
          their integer and floating point equivalents). In general this macro
          should be used by all packages that include PRM_PAR, all monoliths
          are assumed to use this by default.

          <p>Third-party sources will not come with a
            <code>make install</code> target which installs a
            manifest<index>installation!special</index>.  It is 
            reasonably easy to add such support, however, as
            described in <ref id="config-tclsys"/>.  The crucial
            feature is the <em>one line</em> installation command
            declared in the macro
            <code>STAR_SPECIAL_INSTALL_COMMAND</code>.  If this macro
            variable is present in a <code>configure.ac</code> file,
            then Starlink automake will generate an
            <code>install</code> target which uses this command to do
            the installation, in such a way that a manifest file can
            be generated automatically.  The argument to this macro is
            executed as the last command (or commands) in a subshell,
            the exit value of which is tested for a success status.
            For this to work, the command must have the following features:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>It must include the exact string <code>$(MAKE)</code> (as
                opposed to plain `<code>make</code>'), as part of some
                <code>$(MAKE) ... install</code> command.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>It must be prepared to install its files in a
                  location which is prefixed by the value of the
                  environment variable <code>$DESTDIR</code>.  Recent
                  versions of automake generate support for this
                  variable automatically, older versions appear to
                  have had the same functionality, but used a variable
                  <code>$INSTALL_ROOT</code> for it.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The subshell within which the given command is
                  executed must exit with a zero status if the command
                  is successful, and a non-zero status otherwise.
                  This will happen if, for example, the last command
                  in the macro argument is a `make' command, since
                  this exits with a non-zero status if the make fails,
                  and this is passed on to the containing shell.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            The example shown in <ref id="config-tclsys"/> shows a use
            of this macro which satisfies these constraints.</p>

          <p>The command may be as complicated as you like, but note
            that <em>it is collapsed onto a single line</em> by autoconf, so
            although you may spread the macro argument over several
            lines for readability, each command <em>must</em> be
            separated by a semicolon (or double-ampersand or double-bar).</p>

<!-- This comment is rather puzzling: it's redundant, isn't it?
          <p>The generated Makefile rule requires that the makefile
            variables <code>$(PACKAGE_NAME)</code> and
            <code>$(PACKAGE_VERSION)</code> be set.</p>

            <title>STAR_SUPPRESS_BUILD_IF</title>
          </subhead>

          <p><strong><code>STAR_SUPPRESS_BUILD_IF(test, message)</code></strong></p>

          <p>Some components should be built only conditionally, if
            certain conditions apply.  For example, the
            <code>sgmlkit</code> component can be built only if the
            host system has <code>jade</code> installed on it, but the
            lack of this is not an <em>error</em>, in the sense that
            it should cause a tree-wide <code>./configure</code> to
            fail.  This macro helps with this situation.</p>

          <p>If this macro is triggered, by the given condition
            being true, then <code>./configure</code>,
            <code>make</code> and <code>make install</code>
            <em>will all succeed</em> without compiling anything, with
            the latter installing a correctly formed manifest file
            which does not list any installed files.</p>

          <p>The <code>test</code> in the first argument is a shell
            expression which should evaluate to true (ie, return a
            zero status) if the build should be suppressed.  In the
            case of the <code>sgmlkit</code> component, the
            <code>configure.ac</code> includes the lines:
<verbatim>
AC_PATH_PROGS(JADE, [openjade jade], NOJADE)
AC_PATH_PROGS(SGMLNORM, [osgmlnorm sgmlnorm], NOSGMLNORM)
...
STAR_SUPPRESS_BUILD_IF([test $JADE = NOJADE -o $SGMLNORM = NOSGMLNORM],
    [JADE=$JADE, SGMLNORM=$SGMLNORM: both needed for sgmlkit])
</verbatim>
            The <code>test</code> expression evaluates to true if
            either of the <code>$JADE</code> or <code>$SGMLNORM</code>
            variables has the special values given as defaults in the
            <code>AC_PATH_PROGS</code> macros earlier.</p>

          <p>If the test is true, the message is displayed during the
            <code>./configure</code> run, but the configuration does
            <em>not</em> fail.  Instead, a stamp file
            <code>STAR_SUPPRESS_BUILD</code> is left in the build
            directory, with the consequence that if you subsequently
            type <kbd>make</kbd>, that build will do nothing, emit the
            same message, and also not fail.  If you subsequently
            invoke <kbd>make install</kbd>, that will also succeed,
            but install no files, except a manifest without a
            <code>&lt;files&gt;</code> element.</p>

          <p>If you do any special installation work in your
            <code>Makefile.am</code>, remember to check for the
            existence of this stamp file, and make sure that you do
            not actually install anything if the file is present.</p>

          <p>The difference between this and the standard
            <code>AC_FATAL</code> macro is that the latter is for an
            error in the configuration script -- either a logic error
            there, or a serious problem like being unable to compile
            anything at all!  Alternatively, if a dependency should be
            present because it is listed in the
            <code>configure.ac</code> as such, but it isn't, that's a
            case for a call to <code>AC_FATAL</code>.  The
            <code>STAR_SUPPRESS_BUILD_IF</code> macro is for rather
            more well-mannered interactions with the user, indicating
            that there is other work they might have to do to get this
            component building.</p>

          <p>You should use this macro rather sparingly.  If a
            component depends on a component thus suppressed, there
            will likely be trouble.</p>

<code>.texml_tar</code> tarball contains a <code>.tex</code> file plus
any required figures).</p>

These are the variables
<code>stardocs_DATA</code><index>documentation</index>,

<p>The list of documentation files is not necessarily known
in advance, since the macro <ref id="macro-latex-documentation"

          <title>The relationship with the GNU autotools</title>
        </subhead>

        <p>The build system is based heavily on the GNU autotools,
          autoconf, automake and
          libtool.  Each of these is checked in to the CVS
          repository, and built and installed during the top-level
          <code>./bootstrap</code> process.  Run the commands with the
          <code>--version</code> option to see the actual installed
          version.</p>

        <p>The checked-in libtool is an unmodified libtool
          distribution.<index>libtool</index></p>

        <p>The Starlink autoconf<index>autoconf</index> is based on
          version 2.59, with additions to support preprocessable
          Fortran; these modifications have been submitted to the
          autoconf maintainers, so it is hoped that these
          will become part of the autoconf distribution, at
          which point the Starlink autoconf will revert to
          being an unmodified one.</p>

        <p>The additions are the macros which start <code>AC_...</code>
          described in <ref id="starconfmacros"/>.</p>

        <p>The Starlink automake is a more heavily modified
          version of automake<index>automake!Starlink changes</index>.
          There are a few 
          generic changes to support the added Fortran
          autoconf macros, but the majority of the changes
          are in the service of Starlink's specific requirements.  They
          are summarised here.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Addition of the <code>MONOLITHS</code> and
                <code>TASKS</code> primaries: These function rather like
                the <code>PROGRAMS</code> primary, in that the the
                <code>MONOLITHS</code> primary specifies one or more
                monoliths to install, and the <code>TASKS</code> one or
                more IFL tasks to associate with it.  Like the
                <code>PROGRAMS</code> primary, each <code>MONOLITHS</code>
                variable should have a <code>xxx_SOURCES</code> variable
                associated with it.  Starlink <code>automake</code> also
                emits the makefile rules to compile <code>.ifl</code>
                files to <code>.ifc</code> files.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Addition of the
                <code>stardocs</code>,
                <code>staretc</code>,
                <code>starhelp</code>
                (and so on) prefixes to
                the <code>DATA</code> primary.  Setting these variables has
                the same effect as giving an argument to the
                <code>STAR_DOCS_FILES</code> macro (and friends).  See
                <ref id="macro-special-dirs"/>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Extra <code>LDADD</code> options<index>link
                scripts</index>: In standard 
                <code>automake</code>, the content of the
                <code>LDADD</code> variables must be a list of extra
                objects to add to a program, or extra libraries,
                specified through <code>-l</code> and <code>-L</code>
                flags.  In Starlink <code>automake</code>, you can
                additionally specify extra libraries using the standard
                Starlink <code>*_link</code> and
                <code>*_link_adam</code> commands.  You can add to the
                <code>LDADD</code> variable tokens matching
                <code>`[a-z_]*_link`</code> or
                <code>`[a-z_]*_link_adam`</code> (that is, a sequence
                of lowercase letters and underscore), or either of
                these preceded by <em>exactly</em>
                <code>$(srcdir)/</code>, which you would need to do
                only in the case of test code or the case below.</p>

              <p>You cannot include any options or arguments.  If you
                want, for example, <code>ast_link -pgplot</code>, then
                you should create a local script named, for example,
                <code>my_ast_pgplot_link</code> (that is, matching the
                pattern above), which simply invokes the correct link
                script.  In this case, you will have to include the
                <code>$(srcdir)/</code> element in the line, so that
                the script will be picked up from the current
                directory.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Starlink <code>automake</code> spots use of the
                <code>STAR_MESSGEN</code> and
                <code>STAR_LATEX_DOCUMENTATION</code> macros in the associated
                <code>configure.ac</code>, and produces
                appropriate extra build rules in the generated
                <code>Makefile.in</code>.  If the
                <code>STAR_MANIFEST_DIR</code> is to be substituted by
                autoconf, then Starlink automake adds support for
                installing manifests to the generated makefile.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Default strictness: Starlink automake adds the
                <code>--startree</code> strictness level to the default
                <code>--foreign</code>, <code>--gnu</code> and
                <code>--gnits</code>.  At present, it
                is almost indistinguishable from <code>--foreign</code>, and
                is the default (the default for GNU automake is
                <code>--gnu</code> strictness -- see also <ref
                  id="developments"/>).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>All of the installation rules have been modified to recognise
                the presence of the <code>MANIFEST</code> makefile
                variable, and if it is set true, to include the path to the
                installed file in the output of the command.
                The modified <code>install</code>
                target manages this variable.  The makefile `install'
                target has been modified to create and install such
                manifests by default.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The <code>missing</code> script which is installed as part of
                Starlink automake respects the
                <code>MISSING_SUPPRESS_RUN</code> environment variable.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The package version is reported as

          certain features of it which might change in the light of
          experience.  These are summarised here, as a warning of

                process in <ref id="bootstrapping"/> is likely to
                change as more of the Starlink legacy and new code is
                brought under this build system umbrella.  The
                interface to the `make world' build may well change
                (see <ref id="tool-state"/>).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The default automake strictness is
                <code>--starlink</code>, which is currently almost
                identical to the standard automake
                <code>--foreign</code> strictness.  We may change
                this, and add other files.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The <code>AC_PROG_FPP</code> macro described in <ref
                  id="gnutools"/> will <em>very</em> likely change its
              interface.</p>
