#  Name:
#     update-modules

#  Purpose:
#     Update or initialise the git submodules

#  Type of Module:
#     Bourne shell script

#  Usage:
#     update-modules [-f] [submodule]

#  Description:
#     This script attempts to safely update or initialise the content of all
#     the submodules or the given submodule. It should be ran whenever a
#     submodule is known to be out-of-date, or when the submodules have not
#     yet been initialised. It can also be run at other times to get a listing
#     of the submodules and their status.
#
#     The script can update or initialise a single submodule, or if no
#     command-line argument is given all the known submodules. Note that after
#     any new submodules are added to the repository these must be made known
#     by a git-pull or git-fetch before running this script.
#
#     If any of the submodules contain local changes then this script will
#     refuse to run as the update process is destructive (although most
#     committed changes will be recoverable, see git-reflog). Note this means
#     that no changes to any submodules will be made, regardless of whether
#     they could be updated and/or initialized or not until the problem has
#     been resolved.
#
#     In extreme circumstances when you do not have any changes to preserve
#     the "-f" flag can be used to skip all safety checks.
#
#     It is necessary that this script be ran at least once after a
#     repository clone is created. This will be done by the bootstrap
#     script.

#  Notes:
#     Recovering after errors: If a submodule fails to clone (typical causes
#     are usually network errors or badly configured git) on the initial
#     update the container directory can often be automatically removed. In
#     that case you'll need to re-create it before updating will succeed. It
#     can also be a good idea to remove the partial repository that a failed
#     clone can give you, so for instance if the Perl module failed to clone
#     you should do:
#
#         rm -rf thirdparty/perlsys/perl/perl
#         mkdir thirdparty/perlsys/perl/perl
#
#     before attempting to continue.
