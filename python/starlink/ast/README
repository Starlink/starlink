starlink.Ast is a Python extension that provides an interface to Starlink
AST library. To install first run the make_etc script to build some
required files. Then ensure the environment variable STARLINK_DIR is
defined and do:

python3 setup.py install

or

python3 setup.py install --prefix=<your specific installation directory>

To test it, do

python3 starlink/ast/test/test.py


General Notes:
--------------

- Each AST object class has a corresponding Python class (e.g. the AST
ZoomMap class corresponds to Python type starlink.Ast.ZoomMap)

- Each constant defined in ast.h has a corresponding Python constant. For
instance, the AST__TUNULL constant is available as starlink.Ast.TUNULL.

- A reference to the Python object "None" is used whenever an AST method
would returned a NULL object pointer.

- Unless otherwise stated, the argument lists for all AST functions and
methods are as listed in SUN/211 (special cases are listed below under
"Special Cases"). A general rule is that the value returned by an Ast
Python interface function will in general be a tuple. If the C AST
function returns a non-void function value, it will be the first element
in the tuple. Any other values returned by the C function via supplied C
pointers will be returned as subsequent elements of the tuple, in the
order in which the C pointers appear in the argument list of the C
function. If the C function does not return any values via C pointers,
then the returned Python value will be a single object reference rather
than a tuple. If additionally, the C function returns void, then the
returned Python value will be a reference to the "None" object.

As an example, the C astDecompose function has the following interface:

void astDecompose( AstMapping *this, AstMapping **map1, AstMapping **map2,
                   int *series, int *invert1, int *invert2  )


and the corresponding starlink.Ast.decompose method is invoked as:

map1,map2,series,invert1,invert2 = this.decompose()

The astDecompose function returns void - if it had returned a non-void
value this value would have been the first element in the returned tuple.

- Until some documentation is written, consult the module test script
(starlink/ast/test/test.py) for examples of how to call specific methods.

- Each Python method name is the lower case equivalent of the corresponding
AST method name.

- The standard "options" argument taken by all AST object constructors is
optional in the Python interface.

- Each AST Object "attribute" (as listed in SUN/211) has a corresponding
Python property with exactly the same name. So for instance, either of
the following can be used to set the "Zoom" attribute (the zoom factor)
in a ZoomMap refered to by "zm":

   >>> zm.set("Zoom=1.2")
   >>> zm.Zoom = 1.2

- Ast attributes can be retrieved using the AST "Get" method or the
corresponding Python property:

>>> print( zm.get("Zoom") )
>>> print( zm.Zoom )

The "Get" method is equivalent to astGetC (see SUN/211) in that it always
returns the string representation of the AST attribute value. Each Python
property return the attribute value using the native data type of the
AST attribute (integer, boolean, floating point or string).

- Testing and clearing AST attributes can only be done using the "test"
and "clear" methods (astsee SUN/211):

>>> zm.clear("Zoom")
>>> zm.test("Zoom")

- If an AST function fails, it will raise a Python Exception. Each AST
error code listed in the AST header file "ast.h" has a corresponding
subclass of Exception (e.g. the Exception subclass starlink.Ast.ZOOMI is
raised if an AST function returns an error code of AST__ZOOMI). All of
these Exception subclasses inherit from the single Exception type
starlink.Ast.AstError, which itself inherits from Exception.

- The following AST methods are not implemented in the Python interface
as they are superceded by infrastructure provided by the Python language
itself: astAnnul, astBegin, astClone, astDelete, astEnd, astExempt, astExport,
astImport, astGet<X> (except astGetC, see above), astSet<X>.

- A deep copy of an AST Object can be made either using the Python "copy"
module (e.g. "newobj = copy.deepcopy(obj)"), or using the standard AST
"copy" method (e.g. "newobj = obj.copy()").



Special Cases:
--------------

- The Python interface does not currently include astTran1 or astTran2.
The interface for astTranN is

  result = mapping.trann( in, forward, out )

where "forward" is a boolean, and "in" is a 1- or 2-dimensional numpy
array of floating point values, or any sequence (lists, tuples, etc.)
that can be converted to a numpy array. A 1-dimensional array is only
allowed if the mapping has exactly one input, in which case the length of
the array gives the number of positions to be transformed. If a
2-dimensional array is supplied, its shape should be (Nin,npoint), where
Nin is the number of inputs for the Mapping, and npoint is the number of
positions to transform. The "out" argument is optional. If supplied, it
should be an existing 1- or 2-dimensional numpy array with a shape of
(npoint) (if 1-dimensional) or (Nout,npoint) (if 2-dimensional), where
Nout is the number of outputs from the Mapping and npoint is the number
of positions being transformed. A 1-dimensional array may be supplied
only if Nout is 1. If supplied, the transformed values are stored in the
supplied array. If not supplied, a new array with suitable shape is
created to store the transformed positions. IN either case, the value
returned by the method is a new reference to the array storing the
transformed values.


- The Python interface for astTranGrid is

  pout = mapping.trangrid( lbnd, ubnd, tol, maxpix, forward )

where "lbnd" and "ubnd" are 1-dimensional numpy arrays of integers, or
any sequence (lists, tuples, etc.) that can be converted to a numpy
array. The length of these arrays must equal the number of inputs for the
Mapping. The returned value (pout) is a 2-dimensional numpy array holding
the mapping output values at the grid points.

- Methods for which AST provides variants for different data types (e.g.
astRebin, astRebinSeq, astResample, etc) are unified into one method in
the Python interface. The names of such function are the same as the AST
names, but without any final letter indicating the data type (e.g.
astRebinD, astRebinF and astRebinI are replaced by
starlink.Ast.Mapping.rebin). The data type to use is determined from the
supplied array containing the input data.
